This repository contains my copy of Mike Vanderboegh's unfinished novel, _Absolved_.

`absolved.html` and the `images` directory are a copy of the entire novel, nicely formatted (by me).

`index.html` is an index to the individual chapters, as Mike posted them, with links to the originals. The chapters themselves are in the `samples` directory.

I sampled the chapters after Mike died. His son said that Mike's wife had the whole thing on a USB key, and that she might publish it sometime, but that was back in 2016, and I have seen nothing about it, so I assume she has no intention of claiming copyright. If she does, I will remove this copy.

The chapter index is at [billstclair.com/absolved](https://billstclair.com/absolved/). The nicely formatted copy is at [billstclair.com/absolved/absolved.html](https://billstclair.com/absolved/absolved.html).
