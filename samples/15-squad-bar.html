 of Marine Corps tactics are taught that the smallest tactical and 
maneuver element in the Corps is the fire team. Many combat-tested squad
 leaders, however ' might regularly dispute this contention. As a 
newly-arrived platoon commander in Vietnam, I ordered fire team rushes 
during the heat of one of my first contacts. I was subsequently amazed 
to watch a lone figure burst forth from the squad on my left, and I 
rushed to query the squad leader concerning his understanding of my 
orders.</span><br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: italic">"THAT," he answered, "WAS my first fire team."</span><br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: italic">This
 experience, although humorous in retrospect, was by no means unique. It
 probably was more common than being blessed with a continual full 
complement of Marines. In fact, its very frequency serves to cast 
aspersions upon the effectiveness of the fire team. If a fire team 
sustains only two casualties, or even one in some instances, it simply 
ceases to exist as a tactical or maneuver unit. Thus it seems that this 
vital link, which provides the foundation for our entire tactical and 
administrative structure, lacks the flexibility to function properly at 
less than full strength. --</span> <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">James Webb, "Flexibility and the Fire Team," Marine Corps Gazette, April 1972</span><br><br><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">An Embarrassment of Riches</span></span><br><br>Bill
 Curtis' squad had started out as just two friends getting ready for 
uncertain times. That was back in the Nineties, after Waco. It was just 
Bill and his friend Denny Powell. One buddy team. Friends in high 
school, both of them were now veterans. They'd come home after Desert 
Storm and left the rapidly downsizing military -- Bill had been Army, 
Denny had been a Marine -- to take up wives and civilian careers in 
their native home, Double Springs, Alabama.<br><br>Now they each had 
teenage sons, two of whom also shouldered weapons in the squad. That was
 the way it was with militia, a confluence of like-minded friends, 
bolstered by family. There were folks who allowed themselves to be 
paralyzed by fear of linking up with others, worried (and not 
necessarily irrationally) about federal snitches, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">provocateurs</span>, or just garden-variety nut-burgers.<br><br>Not
 Bill and Denny. They'd had their share of experiences with all three 
over the years, but they just kept on training and building their unit, 
staying legal, keeping their eyes focused on creating skilled riflemen. 
It probably helped that they each had lots of cousins. You didn't have 
to vet somebody you'd known all your life. There were four cousins in 
the squad.<br><br>But the rest were just friends or neighbors they met 
over coffee at school events, talking politics, finding like minds and, 
more importantly, people willing to do something more than talk. They'd 
started out with just a buddy team, themselves, and then found another 
couple of hunters who had the same idea. Another buddy team plus theirs 
and now they had a fire team. It was pure dumb luck that they ran into 
another bunch of guys training in the Bankhead National Forest one 
weekend in 1996. One pickup truck of camo-painted faces carrying rifles 
met three more pickup trucks of camo-painted faces carrying paintball 
guns and of course they'd stopped to ask questions.<br><br>The 
"commander" of that bunch hadn't been able to do a thing when Bill and 
Denny cherry-picked his unit of the best and the brightest. The squad's 
training was far more challenging and focused than paintball games, and 
it attracted the more motivated. Over the years, the unit had waxed and 
waned, dropping men who fell out because of changing circumstances or, 
more often, the demands of their wives.<br><br>Bill and Denny tried hard
 to make sure the wives of their people were happy, and that they 
networked with other spouses so the FTX weekends wouldn't be dead time 
for them. Cheryl, Bill's wife, and Clarisse, Denny's better half, had 
helped immensely with that. As Cheryl told him with a tinge of 
exasperation, "You know, we wives get together out of self-defense. If 
you're going to run off every other weekend and play soldier, the least 
we can do is have as much fun as you are," adding, "and when did you say
 you're going to get around to cleaning the gutters?"<br><br>If somebody
 needed time off to deal with a home situation, nobody ragged him. And 
for the most part, they always came back. Bill had a policy, "Don't 
shoot the wounded." Even when a guy didn't come back to the squad, they 
always parted as friends.<br><br>After Y2K and the passing of the 
Clintonistas from the national political stage, more men dropped out 
because they thought the threat had evaporated with the political 
retirement of the Great Fornicator. But with the election of the current
 president, and especially after the Battle of Sipsey Street, events had
 once again conspired to bring the old volunteers back, bringing 
younger, newer ones with them.<br><br>What was it Ben Franklin had said?<br><br>"Nothing concentrates the mind so wonderfully as the prospect of being hung in the morning."<br><br>Of
 course they had always been friendly with Will Shipman's bunch and had 
trained with them from time to time. But Bill's squad always considered 
themselves a cut above Will's unit because they had tighter standards 
and were more physically fit. Fitness was the key to living in combat, 
Bill knew, and he insisted upon it.<br><br>"I'm trying to keep you alive," he'd said to the complainers. "And me too."<br><br>It
 had been a constant struggle, though, and he had probably lost more 
volunteers from inability or unwillingness to physically hack the 
training than any other single cause. Bill had to admit that even for 
him it was HARD to motivate yourself when there didn't seem to be threat
 looming on the horizon.<br><br>Now, however, he didn't have that problem.<br><br>Now events had managed to grab all of their attention.<br><br>In
 fact, the new volunteers scared up by the current crisis had allowed 
him to spin off another squad of the guys who were too old, too young, 
too out-of-shape, or who had health conditions of one kind or another. 
He'd organized them into a something like a logistics and support unit 
and given command of it to John Stentinius, a Marine veteran of Vietnam 
and Lebanon with an artificial leg to replace the one he'd lost in the 
Embassy bombing and who had more grit, gumption, and brains than the 
rest of them combined. John now had his people busy extending and 
improving the system of supply caches that Bill and Denny had started 
back in the Nineties in the Forest, and up in the Sipsey Wilderness 
area. They were also working on getting communications links of various 
kinds up and running.<br><br>He'd had to transfer some of his old 
friends to the support element, and none of them had liked it very much.
 But there were plenty of young, experienced soldiers and Marines back 
from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who were far better suited for 
what was coming. It was no shame to admit the ravages of time, he'd told
 the old guys, but they had hated it all the same.<br><br>Even so, if 
the volunteers kept coming in at this rate, he could have another 
combat-ready squad in a month, maybe less. He'd probably give command of
 that to one of the experienced newbies, Mike Parker probably. Parker 
had come back from Iraq with a Silver Star and the rest of the men 
looked up at him as a demi-god of war, which he damn near was.<br><br>He certainly was a competent squad leader, Bill thought, probably -- no, positively -- better than me.<br><br>Besides,
 Bill and Denny were like an old married couple by now. They'd had every
 argument they could possibly have and had still remained friends, and 
Bill didn't know what he'd do without Denny as assistant squad leader. 
But if they grew much bigger, eventually Bill was going to be a platoon 
leader not a squad leader, and then what would he do with Denny?<br><br>The
 first real argument they'd had, Bill recalled, was over the size of the
 squad. Denny had insisted that if they ever got big enough, they should
 organize along the lines of a Marine rifle squad -- three four-man fire
 teams and a squad leader. Bill, thinking that they'd never get that big
 anyway, had a preference for the smaller Army squad.<br><br>"We won't 
have any support weapons," Denny had argued, "we'll need all the 
shooters we can get." And he'd added, "Besides, if we think small, we'll
 always BE small. We ought to try to grow this as big as we can."<br><br>It
 had all been merely academic until they finally did get that big, but 
Bill eventually had conceded Denny's point. They would use the proven 
triangular Marine system -- one attacking, two providing cover fire and 
security -- and they would concentrate on making competent riflemen who 
could move, communicate and most of all shoot, dealing out deadly, 
aimed, semiautomatic fire.<br><br>Of course they were hampered initially
 by the miscellany of weaponry the volunteers brought to the task. Deer 
rifles, shotguns, SKS's, Garands, AR and AK clones - you name it. It was
 a logistician's nightmare -- and a small unit commander's, if he cared 
about standardization and the benefits that it brought in combat -- 
which Bill did.<br><br>It was better now. Over the years the committed 
men of his squad -- and those who'd stayed were ALL committed -- had 
worked, scrimped and saved to buy better, more capable weapons. The best
 shot in each fire team was a dedicated marksman now with a semi-auto 
rifle in 7.62 NATO or .30-06. The 7.62x39 ammo famine had been one more 
reason to leave the SKS's and AK's in the gun safes at home, although 
one fire team had merely swapped out their AK-47s for AK-74s in 5.45x39,
 which was still available and relatively cheap, although "relatively" 
and "cheap" were two words of decreasing importance these days.<br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">At
 the outset of World War II, the Marine rifle squad was composed of 12 
men, with no particular internal organization. This setup literally came
 under fire early in that war, as it proved immensely difficult for a 
squad leader to maintain control over as many as 11 men at one time. 
Therefore, after a number of attempts to rectify the I e situation, our 
present fire team organization was instituted in 1944. It has a number 
of advantages over the former system, and has been widely heralded due 
to its "triangular concept" which offers maximum control, 
maneuverability, and firepower. indeed, when compared to the "12-man 
mob" its advantages in these areas are striking:<br><br>Control. This 
was perhaps the greatest advantage of the new system as the squad leader
 had three subordinate leaders in his span of control instead of 11 men.
 This produced more effective supervision.<br><br>Maneuverability. With 
the creation of a Four man fire team, a smaller tactical unit capable of
 independent maneuver evolved. This served to eliminate the spur of the 
moment "you take Smith and Jones and go over there" approach and 
ostensibly brought into existence a bonafide maneuver element below the 
squad level.<br><br>Firepower. The fire team was created to gain maximum
 employment of the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). in fact, the whole 
fire team concept was built around the BAR, which provided the nucleus 
of the team's firepower. Fire team formations were designed to protect 
the automatic rifleman, and one rifleman was assigned a secondary 
mission of aiding the automatic rifleman in, finding targets and 
reloading magazines.<br><br>This arrangement was highly successful in 
exploiting the BAR (and later the M-14 automatic) to full advantage; the
 maximum use and protection of the automatic rifle seems to be the main 
justification behind the present fire team concept. With the advent of 
the M-16, however, this nucleus of the fire team has disappeared. Now 
there may be justification for reorganization. In this regard, it is 
recognized that Marine Corps planners are searching for a heavy 
automatic weapon which would provide the fire team with the same type of
 firepower that the BAR and M-14 automatic did; however, two points must
 necessarily be made concerning this. First, there is currently no such 
weapon in use, and no positive guarantee that one will be found, while 
the M-16 is currently being used. And secondly, instead of finding a new
 automatic rifle of this type, perhaps a better solution would be to 
retain the M-16 and reorganize the fire team.</span></span><span style="font-size:+0;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">-- James Webb, "Flexibility and the Fire Team," Marine Corps Gazette, April 1972</span></span><br><br>But

 Shipman's invitation had been intriguing: "Come on by the house after 
work and bring your pickup truck with the cap on it. I've got something 
for you. Oh, yeah, and bring a couple of your best guys."<br><br>That was all, and he wouldn't elaborate.<br><br>It
 was three days after what the press was calling "The Winston County 
Massacre." By order of the Governor, the ATF and Brightfire thugs were 
gone, replaced by Winston County sheriff deputies and Alabama state 
troopers. Those few federal undercover agents still in place wore ABI 
surveillance that was as close and intimate as their underwear.<br><br>The feds no longer ruled Winston County.<br><br>Will
 was waiting for Bill and his boys on the porch when they drove up. 
"Drive around to the barn," he called out to them. "I'll be with you in a
 minute." They were out of the truck by the time Will came around the 
house and Bill started to ask what this was all about.<br><br>Will cut him off with an upraised palm.<br><br>"Please
 hold all questions until the end of the presentation," imitating the 
voice of Wilson Shropshire, the Double Springs High School principal who
 had served for three decades before passing away of a heart attack at 
his desk. They all recognized their old principal's measured tones and 
laughed.<br><br>Will unlocked the high-security padlock on the sliding 
door. That's new, thought Bill. "All right, boys," Will said as he slid 
back the big door, "come on in and shut the door behind you." He walked 
over to the light switch and gave it a flick. Overhead flourescents 
flickered into brilliance. Bill Curtis and Denny Powell followed Will 
in. Mike Parker turned and slid the door shut.<br><br>Mike Parker 
whistled softly. The barn was packed with crates, Bill saw. No, not just
 crates, military crates. Some had tarps over them and some had recent 
spray black paint over the markings. What the . . .<br><br>Will turned to face Bill Curtis. "How big is your unit now, Bill?"<br><br>"Total? About 32, with more coming in every day," Curtis answered. "The ATF and Brightfire are really great recruiters for us."<br><br>Shipman nodded. "You know, Bill, I always appreciated the fact that you grew your own unit and never tried to cherry-pick mine."<br><br>Curtis answered with a smile, "That's because I figured you'd beat the hell out of me if I tried."<br><br>"You're right. I would have. But we've both cooperated for so long I think of y'all as my own."<br><br>Curtis
 started to open his mouth and Will Shipman saw the objection coming. 
"Don't get your panties in a wad. I'm not trying to take over your unit,
 although the time may come soon when you'll want me to. Let's just say 
for right now that we're brothers in arms and I can stand having you 
better armed, is all. We've both got plenty of enemies out there, don't 
you think? DOMESTIC enemies?"<br><br>Overcome by curiosity about what 
was in the crates, Bill was going to let slide that crack about wanting 
Will to take over. So he merely replied, "Yeah, they buried the Sheriff 
today on account of some of those domestic enemies."<br><br>Will nodded again. "I went to the funeral." The Sheriff and his two deputies were buried in a common ceremony.<br><br>Almost all of the county and half the state had turned out for it. The Governor was even there. So was Jack Durer.<br><br>Will
 continued, "Anyway, I've got some presents for you and your boys. It's 
time to spread around the Shipman family fortune, I think."<br><br>Bill Curtis was fit to bust. "Quit beatin' around the bush, Shipman, and tell me what's on your mind."<br><br>Shipman
 grinned and turned to a shorter stack of crates in front of the others.
 "This," he said as he pulled the tarp off, "is what's on my mind."<br><br>On top of the stack of crates was twenty pounds of parkerized steel and gleaming, linseed oil-soaked wood on a bipod.<br><br>The
 three men gaped at the sight. Finally, Bill Curtis said, 
"Whole-E-SHIT." It wasn't an exclamation, as much as a benediction. Mike
 Parker added, "That's a fact." They all moved forward to look at it, 
but nobody wanted to touch it, lest the mirage disappear.<br><br>Shipman
 smiled indulgently, like a dime store Santa Claus at a bunch of 
goggle-eyed kids. "This, my friends, is an M1918A2 Browning Automatic 
Rifle manufactured by the International Business Machines Corporation in
 1944. It is new and fresh out of the cosmoline. I've got magazines and 
ammunition to go with it."<br><br>Mike Parker jumped on that. "How many mags? How much ammunition?"<br><br>Shipman
 replied, "For you? Twenty magazines and 2000 rounds of ball in 
bandoleers and stripper clips per rifle." He added, "I've also got web 
gear to go with each BAR."<br><br>Parker whistled again, and then asked the last, vital question. "How many rifles are you going to let us have?"<br><br>"Well,
 I've been thinkin' on that. Allowin' for your unit growin' and all, 
plus maybe puttin' some ammo and rifles in caches for back up, I figured
 on ten. If you grow your unit some later, there's more where these came
 from."<br><br>"How many more?" asked Parker.<br><br>"There's a hundred total, counting these."<br><br>Bill Curtis said the only thing he could think of. "Well, shit and shove me in it."<br><br>Shipman laughed. "If you insist. I've got a manure pile out back that's handy."<br><br>Denny Powell finally recovered his voice. "Where in the name of God . . ."<br><br>"Well," replied Will Shipman slowly, "that's a long story."<br><br>So he told them about the preacher's son, the deacon and the boxcar. He gave them the short version.<br><br>When
 Will was finished, Bill Curtis looked at the BAR again, longingly, 
lovingly. In wonder, he said again, "Well, shit and shove me in it."<br><br>"There's more," Shipman offered.<br><br>"What?" asked all three men at once, as if on cue.<br><br>"Hand
 grenades. Old World War II frags, but they work. Some M15 Willy Peter 
smokes. Rifle grenades. High Explosive Anti-Tank dual purpose and Willy 
Peters. Springfield rifles with attachments to launch 'em and the blank 
cartridges to make 'em fly. You can have ten Springfields, too. That's a
 case of them right there," Will said as he pointed at the bottom of the
 stack of crates. "And another 10,000 rounds of ammo to go with 'em. 
It's corrosive of course, and you'll have to be scrupulous about 
cleanin' the weapons, but it's got one advantage over modern 
non-corrosive."<br><br>"What's that?" asked Mike Parker.<br><br>"It's free, son," replied Shipman, "it's all free."<br><br>Bill
 Curtis knew enough to look a gift horse in the mouth. "And what will 
you be wantin', Will Shipman, in payment for all these 'free' toys?" He 
knew the answer, but he wanted to hear it from Will's own mouth.<br><br>Will
 looked offended, then smiled craftily, and then, he turned deadly 
serious. "What I want, Billy Curtis, is for you and your bunch to come 
runnin' if me and mine get hit. Just like I'll come runnin' if you get 
hit. There's a war comin'. If you hadn't noticed, it's already here. So 
what I WANT is for you and yours to get real familiar with these 
'toys'," Will ground out the word with emphasis, "so you won't blow your
 own balls off when I need you. I need you to be blowin' the other 
bastards' balls off when, and not if, they come back."<br><br>Will 
paused, then turned friendly again. "What I want in return for the 
firepower is for you to show me what a competent small unit leader I 
know you to be. Good enough?" He stuck out his hand.<br><br>Curtis didn't hesitate. He shook Will Shipman's hand. It was a blood oath and they both knew it.<br><br>"Hell,
 Billy," said Shipman, "your boys are better than my boys because you've
 had 'em trainin' for years when mine were just laid up and watchin' war
 movies on the DVD. I'm smart enough to know that. Well, my boys are 
gettin' ready again, but your boys are ready now. Think of this as a 
return on all that sweat equity you put in."<br><br>Bill nodded at the 
complement, equally pleased that it had been given and also in the 
knowledge that it was indisputably true. Then a thought occurred to him.<br><br>"You
 know," observed Bill Curtis, "this ain't the first time the Curtises 
and the Shipmans have stood shoulder to shoulder against an enemy."<br><br>"No,"
 allowed Will, "it ain't." He paused, and then clapped the younger man 
on the shoulder and proclaimed, "The First Alabama Union Cavalry 
Regiment rides again."<br><br>Curtis reached out for the BAR, but 
Shipman beat him to it. "Get your own damn BAR, this one's mine. It took
 me half the night to get the cosmoline off'n it. It was like petrified 
dinosaur turd after almost seventy years in that mine. Go clean your 
own."<br><br>"Okay," said Bill Curtis good naturedly. "C'mon, boys," he 
said to Denny and Mike, "let's get this stuff loaded and back home." The
 work party set to their task with enthusiasm.<br><br>Will Shipman just stood back and enjoyed the scene.<br><br>He could afford to, bein' Santa Claus and all.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold;font-size:130%;">T.O. &amp; E.</span><br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">The
 key weakness of our present system is a lack of flexibility. The 
present fire team concept cannot absorb casualties and continue to 
function adequately, does not properly use the team leader as a unit 
leader, and is poorly suited to the M-16 rifle. However, it is far 
superior to previously attempted concepts and there seems to be a 
question as to whether a better system could ever be found. There is a 
better system which is easily adaptable to today's Marine Corps. It 
involves no changes in manning levels and has been combat tested. It 
involves changing the fire team from its present four-man structure to a
 six-man team composed of a fire team leader, assistant fire team 
leader, and four riflemen. Let's examine the advantages using the 
triangular concept as a reference point.</span> -- James Webb, "Flexibility and the Fire Team," Marine Corps Gazette, April 1972</span><br><br>Tommy
 Powell, Denny's oldest son, tossed and turned in a dream from which he 
could not awaken. People were trying to kill him and they shouted in 
strange languages. There was a wall. They had to make it to the wall, 
somebody yelled.<br><br>His dad? No. Somebody else.<br><br>He followed 
him as the bangs and flashes and zips seemed to come from everywhere. 
Somebody in front of him got hit. Tommy could see the blood and tissue 
blown out the back of the man's thigh. He knew that he knew him but he 
couldn't remember his name. Young like me. The rifle, someone else 
screamed, get the rifle. Tommy slung his own and picked it up. It was 
big and heavy, but somehow though he'd never seen one before, he knew 
how it worked.<br><br>He made it to the wall, and woke up covered with 
sweat, the shots and the shouts and the screams still echoing in his 
ears. He was in his room. It was quiet in the room, still early evening 
and he had to go to school tomorrow. Beyond the door, he could hear the 
muffled news on the television downstairs as his mom waited for his dad 
to come home. He lay back down on the sweat-soaked covers and closed his
 eyes, but sleep wouldn't come for a long time.<br><br>"Well, if we drop
 back into the old late World War II/Korean War model used by the 
Marines, then that makes it one grenadier and one BAR per fire team, 
with one rifleman designated as the assistant BAR man," said Denny 
Powell.<br><br>They were all in the cab of Bill Curtis' pickup, on the 
way home to examine their new toys. They were discussing how this 
embarrassment of riches would fit into their Table of Organization and 
Equipment, their T.O. &amp; E.<br><br>"We've already got a Designated 
Marksman per fire team," said Curtis. "We never figured on getting 
automatic weapons and the DM was supposed to sub for that. So do we give
 up the DM? You can't make the Assistant BAR man do anything else but 
that, right? Are we going to have fire teams made up of all specialists 
except for the team leader? Who's going to be the rifleman/scout? The 
DM? The team leader?"<br><br>Denny Powell replied, "Look, I don't have 
an answer yet, I'm just thinking out loud here, so bear with me. The 
Marines summarize their fire team organization with the phrase 
"ready-team-fire-assist", since that's the arrangement of the fire team 
when its in a column. 'Ready' is the rifleman/scout. 'Team' is the team 
leader, who also works as a grenadier with an M203."<br><br>Mike Parker broke in, "You can't have a team leader with a bolt action rifle, it's too damn slow."<br><br>"Yeah,
 yeah, I know," said Denny, "let me finish the thought. OK. The 
automatic rifleman, nowadays armed with an M249 SAW, also served as 
second in command of the fire team and is called "Fire." The AAR carries
 his extra ammunition and is called 'Assist.' That way, when you're 
communicating in the middle of a firefight, nobody has to guess who's 
being addressed."<br><br>Denny paused for a moment.<br><br>Mike said, "Well . . ." but Denny cut him off.<br><br>"Let
 me finish. So you move by rushes. If you take fire, the fire team is 
organized in such in a methodical way as to engage the enemy with fire 
team 'rushes' -- movement by one part of the team during cover by fire 
by the other part of the team. Usually, its first the Rifleman and Team 
Leader will move ahead, being covered by the Automatic and Assistant 
Automatic Riflemen, then the Automatic and Assistant Automatic Riflemen 
will move up to the Rifleman and Team Leader, being covered by the 
Rifleman and Team Leader, and so on. The process is repeated until you 
can't go any farther without serious risk to the entire fire team. Of 
course the team is also covered by other fire teams in the squad. The 
optimum ratio of support fire teams to attacking fire teams is 2 to 1. 
Somebody actually did a study on it. Some Army general, I think, I read 
an article about it once, General Dupree or something."<br><br>Mike Parker corrected him, "DePuy."<br><br>"Yeah, that's it." Denny took a sip from his Diet Mountain Dew and continued.<br><br>"Anyway,
 once you're on the objective, the fire team assumes a 'hasty 180', 
where the Automatic Rifleman covers 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock (12 o'clock 
being the most likely avenue of enemy approach), with the Rifleman and 
Assistant Automatic Rifleman covering 9 to 11 and 1 to 3 respectively. 
The Team Leader is next to the Automatic Rifleman to complement his fire
 with grenade rounds and to assign targets for the M249. Once a frontal 
enemy counterattack is deemed unlikely, the fire team then will assume a
 'consolidated 360' to secure the flanks."<br><br>Curtis cut in, "And your point is?"<br><br>Denny
 responded with more than a little exasperation. "I told you, I don't 
have a point yet, I'm thinking out loud. But I don't see how putting a 
bolt action rifle into the mix is going to work. It's too thin. And what
 if you have casualties? The whole damn thing breaks down."<br><br>"Well,
 we don't have to use the Springfields, you know," said Bill. "We can 
shoot the grenades off an M1 or M14 type rifle, even an AR come to 
that."<br><br>"Where would we get the grenade blanks?" asked Denny.<br><br>"I
 heard one of Kraut Mueller's guys had some for sale at the last AGCA 
gunshow. They're rollin' their own now. Had 'em in all calibers," 
replied Bill.<br><br>"Guys," interjected Mike Parker, "maybe there's another way."<br><br>"What?" asked Bill and Denny simultaneously.<br><br>Mike Parker smiled. Sometimes these guys were like an old couple that had been married since kindergarten.<br><br>He began to explain.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">The most obvious advantage of a six-man fire team is its overall flexibility in every area of the triangular concept.<br><br>Control.
 The team leader's ability to control his unit should not be affected by
 the addition of two men. Col Hays established the maximum limit for 
control at seven men. The newly organized fire team would provide its 
leader with a maximum of five men, well within the seven man limit, and 
certainly more challenging than the present maximum of three. Abolishing
 the automatic rifleman and the key positions he presently occupies, 
plus the addition of two more men, gives the fire team leader the 
advantage of placing himself where he can best control his unit. The 
final control consideration is the creation of an assistant team leader 
who would be ready to take charge without hesitation. He would also 
occupy key positions in tactical formations.<br><br>Maneuverability. A 
six-man fire team could sustain up to three casualties and still exist 
as an effective maneuver element, thus fulfilling its mission of being a
 tactical and maneuver unit. The six-man team has the flexibility 
necessary for combat since formations can be changed to accommodate 
smaller numbers with no loss in efficiency.<br><br>Firepower. The team 
members may fire on semi-automatic or full automatic at the discretion 
of the team leader. An additional point should be made at this point 
concerning the present search for a new, heavier automatic rifle to fill
 the gap left by the demise of the M-14A. While a heavier automatic 
rifle would undoubtedly provide the fire team with greater firepower, 
the sacrifice in overall flexibility negates its advantages. This is 
especially true when one considers that the M-60 machine gun is usually 
available at the platoon level, and that any contact made at ranges in 
excess of even 100 meters may be supplemented by external supporting 
arms of some sort. Therefore, the advantages gained in overall 
performance and flexibility by not implementing a different automatic 
weapon are greater than those derived from its use. . . The beauty of 
this entire proposed change is its flexibility, and the fact that it 
would have absolutely no ill effects on current manpower requirements 
within the Marine Corps, while increasing the overall effectiveness of 
the fire team and squad itself. Tactics of employment would not change, 
except that the fire team, perhaps for the first time, would actually 
become what it is purported to be by our instructors-a viable tactical 
and maneuver element, capable of sustaining casualties and still 
performing its assigned missions. </span>-- James Webb, "Flexibility and the Fire Team," Marine Corps Gazette, April 1972</span><br><br>"Is
 that the same Jim Webb that wrote Fields of Fire and got himself 
elected as a Democrat U.S. senator from Virginia?" asked Bill.<br><br>"Yup,
 the very same," replied Parker. "Of course, he wrote that back in 1972,
 before the Squad Automatic Weapon and he had entirely too high of a 
regard for the M16 if you ask me. I hated that jam-o-matic mouse gun in 
Iraq."<br><br>"So," Curtis asked, "what you're saying is that we adopt 
the six-man fire team model, keep the BAR man and his assistant, the 
grenadier, who is not the team leader, and the Designated Marksman and 
we still have a rifleman/scout?"<br><br>"Right," replied Carter. "We'll 
call them 'Ready-One' and 'Ready-Two,' with the DM being 'Ready-Two.' 
The grenadier would be the assistant squad leader, which would take the 
decision making load off the BAR man. Let's call him 'Grenade'. I'm with
 you, though, Bill, the grenadier shouldn't have a Springfield. We 
should find a way to get him the ability to fire them off a semi-auto. 
And we ought to add one other man. A runner slash RTO to tag along with 
the squad leader. The assistant squad leader can be the best of the team
 leaders. I know it’s big. But you know what? The only reason the Army 
ever had smaller squads that I could figure out is that you couldn't get
 a bigger squad in a helicopter or an APC. And the last time I checked, 
we didn't have any air or armor."<br><br>The other two men chuckled.<br><br>"Look,
 it's a twenty man squad. But it’s controllable. The squad leader, we'll
 call him 'Six", still controls 3 fire team leaders plus the RTO/runner.
 I dunno what we'll call him, 'Arty' maybe. The team leaders control 
five. Its doable. It maximizes our strengths, including the new weapons.
 And we've got the numbers to do it. We'll be able to outrange any ATF 
or Brightfire bunch we've seen so far and we'll hit harder, even if some
 of them have M203s. You know, even if we didn't have the BARs and the 
rifle grenades, this would be a better organizational model for militia.
 You can still start out with buddy teams and build to this point. Webb 
may be a sell-out prick as a politician but he was right about this. And
 you know what, Marine squad leaders in Iraq and Afghanistan shuffled 
their teams to make two teams of six for just those reasons."<br><br>"I was going to give you the next 13-man squad, you know."<br><br>Parker
 shrugged. "So what? If it happens, it happens. Its not like it means a 
big raise in salary or something. The main thing is to put together as 
capable a squad as possible and this is the way I think we can do it. 
But I've got one other radical suggestion."<br><br>"What?" asked Curtis.<br><br>"We transition from two-man buddy teams to three-man teams."<br><br>Denny blurted, "What?"<br><br>Curtis just said, "Why?"<br><br>"I
 know, I know, it's heresy right? We all learned on the two-man buddy 
team concept. But I've been doing a lot of reading lately on squad 
organization and I'm convinced that just like bigger fire teams, the 
larger buddy teams make sense. Hear me out."<br><br>He saw they would hold their objections and so he proceeded.<br><br>"If
 a fire team is six men, then why not have two three man buddy teams? 
One is led by the team leader and the other lead by the assistant team 
leader. The three-man team, some folks call 'em 'triads', has greater 
depth that the traditional buddy team. If one man is hit, there's still 
two more to carry on with the mission, rather than having an orphan with
 nobody to watch his back. The ChiComs and the NVA and VC all used 
three-man cells as the ideal building block of their ten man squads with
 3 3 man cells and a squad leader. You've got a full crew for an 
automatic weapons section, like for an example a BAR man, 'Fire,' an 
AAR, 'Assist', and our Assistant Team Leader/Grenadier, 'Grenade.' 
That's one base of fire element supporting the Ready One, Ready Two and 
Team on the assault."<br><br>He paused and he saw they were with him so far.<br><br>"Now,
 in addition to being more durable in case of casualties, it's a lot 
easier to spread the work of living in the field and maintaining 
yourself as a fighting team with three instead of two. We don't want to 
be caught in the position of digging fighting positions or anything 
unless we have to, but it's sure as heck easier with three instead of 
two. Plus, except during operations you've got one guy on watch, one guy
 cooking, cleaning weapons or working and a third sleeping."<br><br>Mike paused, looked up and saw Denny nodding.<br><br>"Now
 Denny, you're absolutely right about DePuy's work. He not only thought 
that two back, one up was a better way to assault, he PROVED it. With 
two fire teams to provide a base of fire to ensure suppression of the 
defenders and one fire team, out front attacking (which gives you fewer 
targets for the enemy), the attack would succeed nine out of ten times. 
If you reversed it and put two up in the assault and kept one back, the 
odds of success fell to 25 percent. His conclusion was that on whatever 
scale of military operations you were talking about, success went to the
 smallest size of maneuver element backed up by the greatest amount of 
suppressive fire."<br><br>"Patton said it the same way in World War II, 
but never got around to putting it down in so many doctrinal words. 
Remember the way they used to do it with the old heavy weapons squads? 
Automatic weapons to keep their heads down to make them seek cover. 
Mortars to seek them out with indirect fire when they hid. And anti-tank
 missles to destroy the bunkers or the houses when they ran from the 
mortars into overhead cover. Well, gentlemen, our fire teams will now 
have all three. BARs and Designated Marksmen for accurate suppressive 
fire. Rifle grenades to hit them with indirect and more rifle grenades 
to blow holes through walls."<br><br>He saw they were both nodding, working it out in their heads, imagining the new T.O. &amp; E.<br><br>"The
 greater our suppressive fire and the faster we maneuver into the 
bastards, the more fights we'll win and the fewer casualties we'll have.
 Rommel said it. Patton said it. DePuy proved it. It requires training, 
practice, and repetition, but now we've got the tools to make it all 
work."<br><br>Parker stopped, looking at Bill and Denny like a 
prosecuting attorney surveying a jury after an eloquent, lucid and 
forceful summation.<br><br>Curtis looked at Denny Powell. "What do you think?" he asked.<br><br>"I think Mike's right. I think it'll work."<br><br>"OK," decided Bill Curtis, "I'm not entirely convinced about the three-man buddy team, but let's try it."<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><span style="font-size:130%;">Slow Rate</span><br><span style="font-size:+0;">[Ten days later</span></span>]<br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The
 mission of the rifle squad is to locate, close with, and destroy the 
enemy by fire and maneuver, or repel the enemy's assault by fire and 
close combat. The rifle squad consists of three fire teams, each of 
which is built around an automatic weapon and controlled by a fire team 
leader. The squad is composed of 13 men: a sergeant (squad leader) and 
three fire teams of four men each. Each fire team normally consists of a
 corporal (fire team leader/grenadier), two lance corporals (automatic 
rifleman and assistant automatic rifleman), and a private or private 
first class (rifleman). . .The Squad Leader . . . is responsible for the
 discipline, appearance, training, control, conduct, and welfare of his 
squad at all times, as well as the condition, care, and economical use

tactical employment, fire discipline, fire control, and maneuver of his 
squad. . .The Squad Leader trains his squad in the performance of tasks.

 Parker stood at one end of a large cleared space in the back of Duff's 
Plumbing Supply. On the folding table in front of him was an M1918A2. 
They had cleaned it up, along with the other nine. There were twenty men
 in the room, two per rifle. The automatic rifles lay on other folding 
tables in front of the men, two rifles and four men per table. The 
tables and chairs were borrowed from the First Baptist Church.<br><br>The
 BARs didn't look the same as they had when they'd been first cleaned of
 cosmoline. The clunky bipods had been removed and were laid out beside 
the rifles, and the original flash hiders had been replaced with Korean 
War vintage slotted flash suppressors, which were far more efficient at 
their job.<br><br>When Parker saw the flash suppressors, he had to know. "Where did you get these?" he had demanded of Bill Curtis that morning.<br><br>"Oh,
 Will Shipman gave 'em to me, along with a whole bunch of other stuff. 
The day after we got the rifles, I told him our ideas for using the BARs
 and the grenades, and how we needed grenade launching attachments for 
the M1As and the Garands that we already own. And I threw in about how 
some 7.62 NATO grenade blanks would be a good idea, and maybe some BAR 
spare parts kits. Three days later he shows up with a couple of stout 
cardboard boxes of stuff and yesterday the rest of it came in by UPS to 
Will's marina, and he called me to come pick it up."<br><br>"Where did he get it all?" asked Mike Parker. "How did he come up with it? Snap his fingers?"<br><br>"Well, I asked him the same thing and he told me traded Kraut Mueller for all of it."<br><br>"Well, Mueller's got the connections. What did he trade?"<br><br>"You're
 goin' to love this. You remember that boxcar? Well, there were two 
crates of Liberator pistols in there, new in the cardboard boxes. TWO 
CRATES. What're they worth these days? At least a couple thousand each 
for new, unfired in the box, right? Well, it seems all he had to do was 
wave a couple of those under Kraut Mueller's nose and everything we 
needed appeared by magic."<br><br>Mike Parker marveled at the way the 
world sometimes worked. "Bill, it's like a famous man once told me, 
'Shit and shove me in it.'"<br><br>You could hear their laughter out on the road.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">I
 joined the 26th Division while they were right in the middle of the 
Tennessee maneuvers. I was assigned as a BAR man in the 2nd Platoon of C
 Company, 101st Infantry Regiment. I liked the BAR; it gave you a lot of
 firepower. My BAR was a M1918A2 with a bipod on the barrel. Although in
 combat, I got rid of the bipod. I think everybody did. It would catch 
on things. I kept mine in my pack. I fired the BAR quite a bit during 
training and qualified with it. We had three=man BAR teams back then. I 
had an assistant gunner and an ammo bearer, but I always carried the 
gun. Our squad was made up of a squad leader, a first and second scout, 
the BAR man and then the ammo bearer and assistant. The rest were 
riflemen; we only had one BAR in each squad. We got over to France in 
September 1944. In combat, I wore a six pocket BAR belt that held two 
magazines in each pocket. But in one pocket, I carried a small box-like 
leather case that had all kinds of spare parts for the gun, So I only 
had ten magazines in the belt and one in the gun. The assistant gunner 
and ammo bearer carried extra magazines for the BAR, as well as ammo for
 their own weapons. They both carried M1s. My ammo bearer also wore a 
full BAR belt with magazines. At one time the army had these square 
shaped canvas bags with a shoulder strap to carry BAR magazines, but I 
can't remember if either of the guys had one. Both my assistant gunner 
and ammo bearer were captured in early November. </span>-- Neal Burdette, in <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.exe/showproduct?saleitemid=544580">US Infantry Weapons in Combat: Personal Experiences from World War II and Korea</a> by Mark G. Goodwin, pp. 18-19.</span><br><br>But just now, Mike Parker was all business.<br><br>"All
 right, gentlemen, this is what you came here to learn about. This is an
 M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle. The BAR is an air-cooled automatic 
rifle using a gas-operated long-stroke piston rod actuated by propellant
 gases bled through a vent in the barrel and locked with a tilting 
breechblock. It fires from an open bolt. The spring-powered cartridge 
casing extractor is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is 
installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker fired and the bolt 
carrier serves as the striker."<br><br>"Each fire team will have one BAR
 assigned to it, as well as a gunner to carry it and a-gunner to feed 
it. However, you will ALL learn how to load, fire, field strip and 
maintain this piece. If everyone else in your fire team is down and out 
of the fight, I want the last guy to be shooting this."<br><br>Parker 
picked up the rifle and held it in front of him. "This is one heavy 
mother of an automatic rifle. But it is what we have. All of the rifles 
in front of you came from the factory with Bakelite stocks which makes 
them lighter, not that you'll notice after you hump them for a while. 
Unloaded, the rifle weighs about twenty pounds. With a web belt full of 
twenty-round magazines, you'll be humping more than twice that. Each 
loaded magazine weighs one pound, seven ounces. That's why we assign you
 an assistant automatic rifleman to tote extra magazines, refill your 
empties and, if need be, to wipe your troubled brow."<br><br>The men chuckled softly, but no more than that.<br><br>"What
 they will NOT do for you is tote your rifle, no matter how heavy it 
gets. If you are assigned the BAR based on your aptitude, YOU will carry
 it, and not your 'Assist.' In the process you will rediscover your 
biceps and find other muscles you never thought you had. This is normal.
 Now, we have also helped you by stripping off the bipods they came 
with. Some BAR men swore by them, but most said they weren't worth the 
weight, that they got caught in vegetation. We also removed the carrying
 handles. Together, this will save you about three pounds. Also, because
 we want to make you harder for the enemy to spot on the battlefield, we
 have removed the old World War II flash hiders they came with and 
installed Korean War vintage sure-'nuff flash suppressors. This not only
 makes it harder for you to be spotted, but preserves your all-important
 night vision."<br><br>Parker glanced around the room.<br><br>"OK, now 
the M1918A2 is an automatic rifle which uses a change lever fire control
 mechanism on the trigger housing that permits fully automatic fire only
 at two rates of fire. I repeat, there is no semi-auto setting for this 
rifle. There is a fast rate, the 'A' position on the selector. This puts
 out about 550 rounds per minute. There is also a slow rate, the 'F' 
position on the selector which puts out 350 rounds per minute. The slow 
rate of fire is achieved by engaging a buffer device installed inside 
the buttstock. However, the maximum EFFECTIVE rate of fire is about 
120-150 rounds per minute, fired in short bursts of from three to five 
shots. This means you'll be pulling the trigger and immediately 
releasing it. With practice, you'll get used to it and you will be in 
full control of the rifle, not the other way around."<br><br>"The 'S' 
position," and here Parker showed the men how he was manipulating the 
selector lever on the left side of the trigger group, "is 'Safe.' This 
weapon has fully adjustable iron sights, with a post foresight and a 
leaf rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation) which is 
graduated from 100 to 1,600 yd with a combat zero notch for immediate 
firing up to 300 yd."<br><br>Parker took in the room again. They were all furiously scribbling notes.<br><br>Good.<br><br>"Now
 remember, this is NOT a light machine gun, people, it is an automatic 
rifle. You will NOT spray and pray with this. If you fire too fast and 
exhaust magazine after magazine as fast as you can, you will burn the 
barrel out and then you won't be able to hit the broad side of a barn 
with it. You WILL use aimed fire in short bursts, I don't care if you're
 fighting the People's Liberation Army of China in an alley. This weapon
 fires faster, is psychologically more intimidating to the enemy and 
punches harder than any other rifle we have. With AP you can penetrate 
any body armor with plates that you are likely to encounter. This weapon
 is our ace in the hole. SO YOU WILL NOT PUT YOUR OWN RIFLE OUT OF 
ACTION BY YOUR OWN STUPIDITY. UNDERSTOOD?"<br><br>They all sang out, "Yes, Sergeant!"<br><br>"There
 may be times when we may need you to use the bipod, for ambushes, 
defensive positions or long-range shooting, so the Assist will be 
carrying it in his pack. When you do, you will also use this fold-out 
shoulder rest in the butt of the rifle. We will teach you how."<br><br>Parker flipped the shoulder rest out, then back in.<br><br>"OK,
 for some of the problems with the weapon that you will encounter if you
 do not perform maintenance the way we teach you. The rate reducer 
mechanism is difficult to clean and is susceptible to damage from 
moisture and corrosion. This renders the weapon inoperable or prevents 
it from firing in automatic mode. Even BARs that were used in the dry 
deserts of North Africa had this problem and I'll tell you why. If you 
rest the butt of this weapon on the ground to clean it vertically, 
instead of laying it flat on a surface, cleaning fluid and burned powder
 collect in the buffer mechanism. In addition, you will be issued 
corrosive ammunition for this rifle. Why? Because that's what we have. 
So you will need to be scrupulous about cleaning it, especially the gas 
cylinder. And I mean on a daily basis, gentlemen. However, if you take 
care of Miss Browning, she will take care of you. She is rugged and 
reliable as long as she's regularly field-stripped and cleaned."<br><br>There wasn't a ripple of amusement. Good, thought Parker.<br><br>"OK,
 because this is a weapon that fires from an open bolt, you will NOT 
carry the BAR with an open bolt on 'Safe' unless in the presence of the 
enemy. This means that at all other times you will carry the weapon with
 the bolt down on an empty chamber and then, and only then, will you 
place a magazine in the rifle. Whether in the presence of the enemy or 
not, loaded rifles are ALWAYS carried with muzzles elevated or pointed 
to the front. ALWAYS."<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SSNZL_vM0cI/AAAAAAAABcY/1p6SBTb_vR8/s1600-h/BAR+mag+belt.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270154051576451522" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: pointer; HEIGHT: 139px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="15-squad-bar_files/BARmagbelt.jpg" border="0"></a>"Now,
 you will notice that each automatic rifleman will be issued an M1937 
BAR Magazine Belt. These belts and the empty magazines issued with them 
are on each end of your table. Study them. You will notice when you do 
that the original lift-a-dot and stud fasteners have been removed and 
replaced with velcro. This was done by our ladies' auxiliary at our 
commander's request because the original set-up was known to deeply dent
 the magazines if the auto rifleman hit the dirt hard enough. The blow 
would center on the post, driving it into the mag and the resulting dent
 would stop the magazine follower from freely traveling, causing a 
failure to feed. I know that the velcro is noisier than the snaps. All 
that means is that you take the flap off your first pocket and tuck it 
down behind the magazines before you settle in to an ambush position. 
After the ball is opened, believe me, nobody's going to hear the 
velcro."<br><br>"One last comment on magazines. They require at least as
 much maintenance as the rifle itself. They must be frequently 
disassembled, cleaned, wiped dry, and thinly coated with oil. As much as
 possible, keep them free from dirt and rust. If not the spring and 
follower will stick. Your life and all of our lives may depend upon it. 
And you'd better not sluff that duty off on your Assist. I don't mind if
 he helps. I don't mind if you're a finicky SOB who insists on cleaning 
his own mags. Good on you. But if I catch you dumpin' the job on your 
AAR, I'll feed you those mags rectally, without lubricant."<br><br>He glared at the crowd. Nobody breathed. They believed him.<br><br>"All right. Here's how you field strip the M1918A2 BAR . . ."<br><br>Tommy Powell was mesmerized. This was the rifle from his dream. The one somebody had dropped and that he'd picked up.<br><br>He'd
 had the dream twice more since the first night. It started at the same 
place, but the second and third time it ended a little further on. He 
was at the wall. He ejected the empty magazine of the rifle and slapped 
in a new one, and he pointed it at the screaming men trying to kill him 
and began to fire rolling bursts at the windows. There was a farmhouse 
and there were windows. Someone was screaming about grenades and he woke
 up.<br><br>It troubled him some, especially now that he understood that
 it wasn't a dream, or even a nightmare, but a vision. His grandmother 
had the sight. His momma had it too, although not as specific as his 
grandma.<br><br>It was the Cherokee blood in them that gave them the 
vision power. Tommy knew he had it. He'd once seen his grandmother and 
grandfather when they were young down sitting under the Natural Bridge. 
There was an old-timey car and a picnic. His grandfather took out some 
chewing tobacco from his bib overalls and bit off a chew. Then he looked
 up at Tommy and smiled. That was it. He woke up.<br><br>It had been 
broad daylight and he was sitting under the Natural Bridge and it was a 
waking dream. A vision, said his grandmother after he'd told her about 
in embarrassment, not a dream but a vision. There were places, she 
explained, where the visions came more readily than others. His momma, 
who had more education than his daddy, explained it like this.<br><br>"Tommy,
 there's places in our world where time and space intersect. Where you 
can stand today and feel yesterday looking over your shoulder, hear it 
whispering in your ears, and see it playing out in front of your eyes. 
Natural Bridge is place like that. I met a man once who said he had an 
experience like that up at Stone's River in Tennessee on a battlefield 
where his great granddaddy fought. Your grandfather died a long time 
before you were born. I reckon it was just his way of saying hello 
across the years. Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to tell anybody 
else who hasn't got the sight about it, they won't understand. Just 
appreciate it for the gift it is. Someday it might warn you of danger 
so's you can get out of the way."<br><br>Since then, he'd had other 
visions. His grandma came to him the night she died in Birmingham, him 
sleeping in his bed in Winston County, and told him not to fret, that 
everything was all right. He woke up the next morning, and his momma and
 daddy had come in all puffy-eyed and cried out from the ride home and 
told him she had passed. He told them about how grandma had said it was 
all right, and he wasn't upset, not a bit, though he'd been close to 
her. There were other times, visions he couldn't explain. An eagle and 
an Alabama black panther, fighting, but friendly-like, as if neither 
wanted to kill the other. A Cherokee warrior who turned and spoke to him
 in ancient words he understood, though afterwards he couldn't remember 
them. And now this. It was a warning, Tommy had no doubt. Maybe he would
 have the dream enough times where he could see the end and know what to
 do when the time came.<br><br>He would wait.<br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">After
 they were captured, I was short on ammo. Another guy in the squad 
filled in for them after that. I had a metal loader that fit over the 
top of the magazines and he would get stripper clip ammo, the five round
 clips for the Springfield, and he'd run those stripper clips down into 
the magazines. He was pretty good, he always came up with ammo and 
grenades and kept us well-supplied. If we didn't get issued the 
five-round stripper clips, we'd have to get our ammo from eight-round M1
 clips. We got a mix of ball and armor piercing ammunition, but no 
tracers. I didn't want any tracers. . . The BAR was very accurate, if 
you had open terrain you could shoot out to 600 yards. I felt like I 
could stitch someone at that range. With trigger control, I could shoot 
one round at a time or two rounds or as many as I wanted. I never had 
any problems at all with mine; it was a dependable weapon. You had to 
keep it pretty clean, but I didn't think it was hard to maintain. I kept
 a can of bore cleaner and a little can of oil in the belt pocket with 
the leather case. I would have to borrow a cleaning rod to clean the 
bore.</span> -- </span><span style="font-size:+0;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Neal Burdette, in US Infantry Weapons in Comb</span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">at: Personal Experiences from World War II and Korea by Mark G. Goodwin, pp. 19.</span></span><br><br>It
 took them a while to train up the BAR men and the grenadiers and to 
work the kinks out of the new structure. On weekends, the Bankhead once 
again rang with automatic weapons fire and the crump of explosions, but 
nobody complained or called the Sheriff's office. Hearing the echoes, 
they would just say to one another, "That's our boys up there again, 
hard at it." If anybody replied it would be something like, "I hope they
 save enough ammo for those damn Brightfire fiends."<br><br>Trying to 
control 19 men seemed tough at first to Bill, but mostly it was just a 
matter getting used to the fact that the new squad front was so much 
bigger than the old and not to jam in on each other. Using the two back,
 one up system also took some practice, and the three man buddy teams 
caused some friction with men who had been split up and didn't like it. 
Finally, some of them came to Bill and told him it just didn't feel 
right. Even Parker had to admit that the sociology of three men as 
buddies didn't always work out. Some men played dominance games and 
others just had a buddy they wouldn't part with and treated the third 
man like a go-fer, not a partner. Parker argued that is was just a 
matter of leadership by the squad and fire team leaders to make sure the
 third man wasn't dumped on, but it still caused problems.<br><br>Finally,
 being militia, they decided to compromise. There would be fire teams 
made up of two-man buddy teams and others made up of three-man teams. 
The troops griped about that too because it meant shuffling the fire 
teams once more, but they had to admit it was better than the 
alternative.<br><br>But even with the unsettling changes, the men could 
sense the new power they had, and they responded well, coming up with 
new suggestions. They had used whistles for command and control before, 
but it was young Phillip Curtis who suggested to his father that each 
team leader and the squad leader should use one of a different type or 
pitch so as eliminate confusion. They worked with small squad radios for
 the leaders and with 26.5mm flare pistol signals -- smoke for day, star
 clusters by night -- and gradually got used to firing and maneuvering 
without tripping over each other.<br><br>Having such capable fire teams 
allowed them to be split off for special missions in the middle of an 
FTX without worrying about their lacking the combat power to accomplish 
it. The other thing they all noticed was how having bigger fire teams 
enabled the fire team leader to take advantage of tactical opportunities
 without waiting for help or instructions from the squad leader. The 
squad was not only more powerful, but it became more nimble, even with 
its added bulk.<br><br>When they went up against Will Shipman's much 
larger unit with blanks and umpires as OPFOR in the biggest militia 
tactical FTX any of them had ever heard of, they cleaned Shipman's 
clock.<br><br>It wasn't even close.<br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">The
 one big attack we made while I was there, we ran the Krauts off of Hill
 310 in France. We all lined up around the back of an old church with 
all our automatic weapons. We started firing to keep the Krauts pinned 
down. There was also artillery and mortar fire hitting the hill too. 
While we fired, another platoon walked down this little valley and then 
went up the hill. We kept firing until they got on top of the hill and 
we were afraid we were going to hit them. Then we quit firing and took 
off right after them. I fired about six or eight magazines during the 
attack. My assistant was lying right there beside me and when I'd drop 
an empty magazine from my gun, he would reload it. He was reloading them
 as fast as I was firing them. He was a cool and calm guy under fire. 
The Krauts were still popping up out of the holes when we overran them. 
It was like a Fort Benning field problem and it worked just the way it 
was supposed to work. We just kept up a steady fire and the other 
platoon did marching fire going up the hill and the Krauts were pinned 
down in their holes. I remember when I ran up there, I ran past a Kraut 
machine gun with a big frame mount and a scoped sight. The crew had been
 captured, we'd kept them so pinned down they couldn't do anything. I 
came to another hole and these guys popped up and then dropped back 
down. I wasn't going to run past them and leave them behind me, so I 
stuck the BAR down the hole and fired about five rounds. I'm not sure if
 I hit them or not, but I went on. We didn't have a single casualty in 
the whole attack. </span>-- Neal Burdette, in US Infantry Weapons in

							<p>Just picking a nit here, Mike, but the Liberators didn't get 
serial numbered as far as I know. I've only seen two up close and didn't
 see a number on either one. Not that it detracts anything from the 
story, which I'm waiting to see in print.</p>

							<p>The BAR could ride again rather easily, in an improved form 
even.  Been a lot of firearms design water under the bridge since 1941.<br><br>I've got mechanical drawings courtesy of Captain Melvin M. Johnson, Jr. (USMC, Reserve), of Johnson Rifle fame.<br><br>Reckon the patent has run out and they could be scanned and put on the internet?<br><br>If you don't have a copy, I recommend his book "Automatic Arms, Their History, Development, and Use."<br>William Morrow, 1941.<br><br>Rare, but there are copies out there.  My copy is MINE and it has mechanical drawings of everything relevant up to 1941.  <br><br>No
 dimensions given on the blueprints but those could be extrapolated from
 the legal parts available, the size of the standard cartridge at the 
time, and such.<br><br>Would be a tougher nut than making your own Sten or Sterling, but not past the abilities of competent and determined machinists.<br><br>Happy Shooting.  I'll have to look into the copyright issues and how badly I wish to piss off the Federales this month.</p>

							<p>Seem to be copyright issues.<br><br>I just spoke to the people
 at Harper Collins, who still hold the copyright as they bought out 
William Morrow and I'm negotiating with them if me publishing a 
reproduction would be fair use or if they'd even care.<br><br>If they 
say "no" then somebody other than myself might stick it on some sort of 
file sharing system that's untraceable that could involve the word 
"torrent" in the name.<br><br>I try to be law abiding.<br>Book's been 
out of print since the 40s and they have no intent to re-publish, but 
publishers are greedy bastards it seems even when all the authors and 
illustrators of the books are dead.</p>

							<p>Yeah!  I'm buying one.<br><br>If you're up for critical 
comments, I think you're laying on the TO&amp;E manual quotes - and in 
fact the TO&amp;E details in general - a little thick.  You're gonna 
have plenty of readers who won't be interested in that stuff, and it 
slows down the story big time.  Some of these chapters read like a 
really competent thriller.  Others, like this one, come across too much 
like militia wannabe how-to.  Maybe you plan it that way, but in real 
life there's no boxcar full of BARs.<br><br>But really!  Great yarn!  I want one.</p>

							<p>Boys, boys.  No need for quarrelling.  The criticism of too 
much TO&amp;E stuff in Absolved is valid, and I struggled with it, but 
here's the deal.  This book is as much a resistance manual as anything 
else.  And if some folks choke on the theory, I can understand it, and 
yes it does get in the way of the story, but the story is not the entire
 deal here.<br><br>Look guys, this is never going to be a Dell paperback
 blockbuster.  But the folks who will read it in the coming period of 
our history need to know this organizational stuff as much as they need 
to know how to fieldstrip an AR-15.<br><br>If I've offered too much 
theory for some, I concede the point, but also know that for every one 
who chokes on Webb's article, there will be one, or some fraction out of
 a hundred, who's been struggling with the subject and who says, "Oh, 
yeah, I get it now."<br><br>One other thing, and that's this quote from above.<br><br>"Take
 a skilled machinist to do it, but they don't have to fall out of 
boxcars anymore than M2 trigger groups have to fall out of the sky."<br><br>I feel the same pride as a father watching his son take his first steps.  I want to shout, "GIVE THAT MAN A KEWPIE DOLL!"<br><br>You've broken the code, my friend.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Mike Vanderboegh<br>III<br><br>PS,
 you're right about the individual serial numbers of the Liberators.  
Big oops there.  Will be fixed shortly and will not appear in the book.</p>

							<p>Thanks for letting me catch a minor flaw in a grand plan, Mike
 :&gt;) I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so the serial number thing stuck 
out to me. I figured you wanted to keep the story as historically 
accurate as possible, otherwise I wouldn't have brought it up.<br>If you
 need any reference work on interrogation, drop me a note. That was one 
of my MOS's in the Army. The nuclear weapons work I did won't be of much
 help unless your book takes a serious plot twist.<br><br>ranamacar</p>
