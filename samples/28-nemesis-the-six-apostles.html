 the Greek tragedies Nemesis appears chiefly as the avenger of crime and
 the punisher of hubris . . . She was sometimes called Adrasteia, . . . 
meaning "one from whom there is no escape"; her epithet Erinys 
("implacable") is specially applied to Demeter and the Phrygian mother 
goddess, Cybele. -- Wikipedia.</strong></em></blockquote><br><br><strong>17 July 1915</strong><br><br>Aram
 Avakian’s father was herding his goats in the hills above their village
 at the base of the mountain that the Ottoman Empire called Musa Dagh 
but the Armenian Christians called Musa Mer when the Turkish gendarmes 
came, looking for a little diversion.  Ordered to hide and be silent no 
matter what happened, little Aram hid under a large basket and listened 
as the Turks raped his mother, one after another.  Aram could hear his 
mother moaning and weeping and the laughter of the gendarmes.  When they
 were done, just before they bayoneted her, one of them asked, “Where’s 
your Christ to protect you now?”<br><br>When they were gone, Aram ran to find his father.<br><br>There
 were six villages of at least five thousand Armenians scattered around 
the base of Musa Mer and all had been ordered to evacuate and march to 
somewhere in the interior, away from the Mediterranean Sea.  Having 
heard rumors of what happened to other Armenian Christians when given 
similar orders, most of the villagers decided to withdraw up the 
mountain, construct defensive positions and defy the order.  <br><br>Some,
 about 60 families, decided they would be safer if they obeyed the 
order.  They marched off with all that they could carry, and were never 
heard from again.<br><br>Between the six villages the Armenians had 
managed to hide about a hundred and twenty modern rifles and shotguns 
from the authorities when they had previously been ordered to give them 
up.  In addition, they had perhaps another 350 out-dated flintlock 
muskets and old horse pistols.<br><br>The Armenians stripped out their 
homes and shops of every manner of provision and carried them up the 
mountainside.  That took them one whole day.  They immediately placed 
sharpshooters at key points and began digging trenches and constructing 
road blocks.<br><br>Arriving to find the Armenians gone, the Turkish 
Army was ordered up the mountain to round them up and kill all who 
resisted, which it would later turn out, had been the plan all along.<br><br>On
 21 July, a force of 200 Turkish soldiers moved up Musa Dagh in 
expectation of an easy victory.  After losing a number of casualties and
 a mountain howitzer, they retreated.  The next attack consisted on 
3,000 soldiers and a large number of gendarmes and Muslim irregulars and
 the Turks drove to within 400 yards of the Armenian camp.  Only a deep 
ravine separated them from their prey.  By this time night had fallen 
and the Turks settled in, expecting to finish the job in the morning.<br><br>In
 the darkness, having no other option, the Armenians took a page from 
the Bible and duplicated Gideon’s feat by infiltrating down and around 
the Turkish position until they had it surrounded.  When they attacked, 
the startled Turks were first thrown into confusion, then panic.  The 
Turkish soldiers and their irregular allies fled down the mountain, 
leaving their camp and considerable war material and food behind.<br><br>But
 they did not go away.  A siege now began and by late August, starvation
 was stalking the Armenians on Musa Mer, which means “the mountain of 
Moses.”  A runner was dispatched through the Turkish lines to the 
American consul at Allepo asking for neutral aid.  He never arrived.  A 
strong swimmer made it to Alexandretta harbor looking for blockading 
Allied warships.  There were none.<br>  <br>Two large flags were made, 
one with a large red cross in the middle of it.  The other read 
“Christians in distress: Rescue.”  These were tied to tall trees, but 
this was the season of heavy rains and fog, so there was little chance 
they would be seen.<br><br>The Turks attacked again, and were repulsed 
again, barely.  It was doubtful the Armenians would be able to resist 
another.  Aram, weak with hunger and too young to fight, said many 
prayers for their deliverance.  God heard him.<br><br>On the 53rd day of
 the siege, one of the Armenian lookouts spotted the French light 
cruiser Guichen offshore.  Her lookouts had spotted the red cross 
banner.  Guichen’s captain launched a shore party in boats to 
investigate, and under the protection of her big guns the Turks dared 
not intervene.<br><br>After linking up with the Armenians and learning 
their plight, the Guichen’s captain wirelessed his squadron commander on
 his flagship, the heavy cruiser  Ste. Jean d’Arc.  The admiral issued 
orders that that all available ships proceed to Musa Dagh to take on the
 survivors of the siege.<br><br>Aram Arkanian’s prayers were answered.  
Over 4,000 Armenian Christians were saved by four French ships of the 
admiral’s squadron and a nearby British man-of-war.<br><br>French 
sailors had to pry the captured Turkish Mauser rifle out of the hands of
 his father before they would let him on board the boat taking them to 
the Ste. Jean d’Arc.  <br><br>“Never forget, Aram,” his father cautioned
 him as they watched from the Ste. Jean d’Arc’s stern railing as their 
ancestral home faded into the distance.<br><br>  “No matter where we go and what God brings us in the future, never forget.”  Aram didn’t.<br><br><strong>Almost one century later.</strong><br><br>The
 basement room was black, illuminated only by the flickering images of 
the wide-screen television. Six men sat in various relaxed postures, 
scattered between couches, easy chairs and bar stools.<br><br>One of 
them, with a tattoo on his right forearm of St. Joan of Arc, the patron 
saint of soldiers, in battle armor and brandishing a large flag, held 
the remote.  Curiously, the flag Saint Joan waved was not that of the 
Fleur de Lis, nor the Cross of Lorraine but one bearing a simple red 
cross.  An historian, not knowing the real story behind the tattoo, 
would have thought it an anachronism and in error.  It was neither.<br><br>On the screen Joe O'Reilly entered a room and demanded, "Jesus Christ, Mick, where the HELL have you been?"<br><br>"Been workin'" muttered an exhausted Michael Collins, his head down on the desk.<br><br>"Workin' where?" Joe shot back. Sleepily, Collins begins to give orders.<br><br>"I
 want a file drawn up on every member of the British administration. 
Look through whatever you can find. Who's Who. Stubb's, Society columns.
 I want names, addresses, clubs, where they bank down to what they eat 
for breakfast. Keep it up to date. Add to it every week."<br><br>Michael Collins begins to rouse. "Tom?"<br><br>Tom Cullen answers, "Um?"<br><br>"Tom!" Collins gets up from the table.<br><br>"Yeah!"<br><br>"Get me a list of the twelve best men in the Dublin division. Young. Without families."<br><br>"What for," asks Cullen.<br><br>"Christ," Collins realizes, "the 'Twelve Apostles'. Just do it, for fook's sake!"<br><br>"Joe, take a letter."<br><br>Collins' number two, Harry Boland enters, demanding "Where the hell have you been?"<br><br>Collins ignores him and begins dictating.<br><br>"'To
 whom it may concern. This is to inform you that any further 
collaboration with the forces of occupation will be punishable by death.
 You have been warned.' Signed, 'The Irish Republican Army.'"<br><br>Boland asks, incredulous, "Are you serious?"<br><br>"'Fraid so," answers Collins. Then he orders Joe, "Send one to every G-Man . . ."<br><br>Neeson was born for this role, thought Steve Avakian.<br><br>"Without
 them the Brits would have no system. They couldn't move. Imagine the 
Castle like an enclave where anyone, and I mean anyone, who collaborated
 knew he'd be shot. They couldn't move outside those fooking walls. 
THAT'S how serious I am."<br><br>Boland, now realizing how serious Collins is, offers, "There's only one problem."<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"We'd have to do it."<br><br>"Yes," says Collins. "So, could you bear it?"<br><br>Avakian hit freeze on the DVD remote, and leaned over the bar to hit the alcove light switch.<br><br>"What's
 the big deal, Steve?" The man in the Lazy Boy brought it upright and 
stood. "We've got this damn movie memorized, you played it so often in 
Kabul."<br><br>"I just wanted to remind you of the thinking process behind the Anglo-Irish War because Collins was successful."<br><br>"Why?" asked Mark Volescu.<br><br>"Because of this." Steve handed out each of them a copy of a letter. "Read it, and then we'll talk."<br><br>It was dated over two years before.<br><br><blockquote><em><strong>"You've got us surrounded, you poor bastards."<br><br>Memo for the Record to the Next Congress<br><br>To: The Victors of the Recent National Elections<br>From: Your gun-owning constituents<br>Subject: The so-called "Gun Show Loophole"<br><br>Congratulations. You have just been swept into power. Enjoy the feeling.<br><br>But
 come January, the special interests who put you there are going to be 
banging on your door asking for various favors. Some of them are going 
to be demanding more gun control legislation, among them a law to close 
the so-called "gun show loophole."<br><br>Heretofore, the bumbling GOP 
has at least been able to fend off these attempts at our liberties, but 
those corrupt incompetents have now been justifiably swept from power 
for their other numerous political sins. Neither Presidential candidate 
mentioned the subject much during the campaign (for good reasons), but 
both are on record as supporting previous bills aimed at exerting 
complete federal control over the private sale of arms.<br><br>You call this "reasonable regulation."<br><br>We
 call it tyranny, for not even King George III was so grasping. But 
since you won the election, it will be your candidate who takes the oath
 and signs the bill. It may be assumed that the new president will sign 
such a bill if you place it before him. However, we do not address this 
memo to him. It is the darker angels of YOUR nature we are seeking to 
save you from, as I will explain below.<br><br>The hubris derived from 
your own smashing electoral victory may incline you to listen to those 
voices demanding that you seize the moment for more gun control. If I 
may, let me explain the possible personal, unintended consequences of 
such an act to you.<br><br>There are in your district, in your state and
 indeed all over the country, a great number of gun owners just like me.
 I suppose if you added us all up there at least a million or two of us.<br><br>Maybe more, maybe less, but once you get into numbers like that, what's a million more or less?<br><br>We
 are the 'cold, dead hands" types, the men and women who have sworn, as 
the old bumper sticker said, "When guns are outlawed, I'll be an 
outlaw." We have fought a political delaying action against the enemies 
of our traditional 2nd Amendment rights for decades now. Indeed, we have
 been shoved back from the free exercise of our historic firearms 
liberty for 70 plus years.<br><br>Now it is plain that we have lost the argument at the polls.<br><br>No matter.<br><br>You
 feel a natural pride at having swept the GOP from the field. But you 
should know that in doing so you have removed any hope we ever had of 
successfully defending our right to armed self-defense in the political 
arena. You will also take up, and I'm certain you will pass, the 
Fairness Doctrine to shut up the talk radio hosts who have so bedeviled 
you these past twenty years. As well, you will pass an Amnesty Bill for 
illegal aliens, which you believe will make any further conservative 
success in national elections impossible. You are right on both counts. 
And, because you now have the votes, you will be successful. You will 
think you have a mandate for whatever you do. And yet . . .<br><br>Consider
 where this puts us. We will no longer have the possibility of stopping 
further attacks on our God-given liberties politically. We will not even
 be able to vent our frustration on talk radio. I'm sure you will also 
get around to "hate speech regulation" of the Internet. And in the 
middle of this you will try to disarm us by means of a "gun show 
loophole" bill, or a new tougher "assault weapons ban" or a ban on 
"assault weapons ammunition" and "armor piercing bullets" which will 
include simple hunting ammunition, or probably a combination of all 
three. Perhaps you will stealthily try to do these things by quietly 
having the ATF manipulate the regulatory process.<br><br>Quiet or not, we will notice.<br><br>You
 will do this because you think you can do it without political or 
personal retribution. I write you today to tell you that if you do so, 
you will be as wrong as you could possibly be.<br><br>You believe that 
if you pass a law backed by the threat of federal violence for 
non-compliance, that we will do what you order without resistance. You 
believe this because you are extrapolating our anticipated behavior from
 your own cowardice, You know that YOU would never do such a thing, so 
we won't either. This is a dangerous assumption on your part, perhaps 
fatally so. For if the discredited Republicans no longer protect us from
 you, then they no longer protect you from us, either.<br><br>You've got us surrounded, you poor bastards.<br><br>Remember
 that we consider our rights merely codified by the Constitution. They 
are, we sincerely believe, God-given and inalienable. Remember too that 
we are willing to die for our liberties rather than surrender them up 
meekly. Remember as well that men and women who are willing to die for 
their principles are most often willing to kill for them too.<br><br>What can this possibly have to do with you?<br><br>Well,
 it's like this. We have been doing a lot of thinking about what we 
would do if we ever found ourselves in this situation, and after 
considerable thought we have decided we agree with Bill Clinton. Back in
 1999, when he was trying to pressure the Serbians into giving up 
Kosovo, then President Clinton expanded American rules of war to include
 -- as legitimate targets of deadly force -- the politicians and the 
news media that shaped and supported his enemy's war policy.<br><br>Not 
to put too fine a point on it, but if you force us into resistance by 
further circumscribing our rights -- by sending federal police to our 
doors to enforce your will -- can't those same Clintonian rules of 
engagement be applied to you?<br><br>Oh, we could certainly defend 
ourselves by shooting back at the hapless instruments of your tyranny --
 the sons and daughters of other Americans who happen to be in federal 
service.<br><br>But wouldn't it be wiser for us -- after the first, 
second or third time this happens -- to adopt Clinton's policy and go 
after the people who sent them? That is, to seek out the bureaucrats and
 politicians who decided to start the war? And, like Clinton, should we 
target the media talking heads and newspaper editors who clamored for it
 in the first place?<br><br>The advocates of citizen disarmament are 
probably willing to fight a war down to the last dead ATF agent, but are
 YOU willing to fight one past the first dead politician? And how many 
dead editors will it take to change an editorial board policy?<br><br>If you pass new gun control laws we will find out.<br><br>The
 president of course will be the safest personage in the country under 
this awful scenario. Killing a president, even if he signed such an 
unconstitutional law, would be tantamount to firing on Fort Sumter, a 
discrediting move no matter what the provocation.<br><br>But, one 
wonders, who would cry over a dead congressman or senator who voted to 
take people's liberty, property and lives? Especially after innocent 
victims of his predatory law-making were already littering the streets. 
You may recall the already lower-than-a-snake's-belly position in the 
polls that Congress currently holds.<br><br>Who indeed would mourn you, beyond your family, your mistress and a few lobbyists?<br><br>Also,
 it may be cold comfort, but we will make sure that your family remains 
behind to mourn you. We will do a far better job of protecting innocents
 than the federal government, perhaps because we don't own any Predator 
drones or F18s or Hellfire missiles or cluster bombs. You will get no 
terrorist outrages like Oklahoma City to easily discredit us - just 
remorseless and deadly accurate rifle bullets, one at a time. Those are 
OUR precision guided munitions.<br><br>Do you really think that in the long run that yours will be more effective than ours?<br><br>These
 are the uncomfortable questions that must be asked now rather than 
later. Unless, of course, you decide that discretion is the better part 
of valor and -- out of enlightened self-interest -- you refuse to 
meander down the bloody garden path toward civil war at the urging of 
the honey-tongued Sirens of "reasonable regulation" gun control.<br><br>It's
 always important for any card player to know the rules of the game 
before the deck is cut. By sweeping away the sorry GOP, and stacking the
 deck with the Fairness Doctrine and enfranchised illegals to toil on 
your political plantation, you will have changed the political rules 
fundamentally and, perhaps, forever.<br><br>Please understand that just 
because you can disenfranchise us, swamp us at the polls, silence us on 
the radio and Internet, despise us and ridicule us in the media, you 
still cannot take any more of our liberties without our acquiescence. 
And we do not, cannot and will not agree. We still get to vote with our 
rifles. You are welcome to believe that we are insane for adopting such a
 position, but even if you are right, we're still armed -- doesn't that 
just complicate your problem?<br><br>We are resigned to being a despised
 minority within our own country, as long as we are a despised and 
FEARED minority whose rights and property are respected.<br><br>You may kill us, but you cannot change our minds.<br><br>Kindly,
 for all our sakes, remember Bill Clinton's rules of engagement. A civil
 war is a two-way shooting gallery. Don't sign your own target.<br><br>Just
 so we're clear, the way you sign your own target is by voting for any 
bill which commands the government's seizure of power of the private, 
intrastate transfer of arms or for one banning the sales or possession 
of any kinds of heretofore legal weapons or ammunition, or for taxing 
them to death, or for any other combination of measures, official or 
unofficial which lead to the same things. Put your "Yea" on any of 
those, and when innocent Americans get killed by federal forces as a 
result, you will have placed the crosshairs over your own heart.<br><br>You have been warned.<br><br>If you want to curse anybody, curse Bill Clinton.<br><br>It was his idea.<br><br>Signed,<br><br>Henry Bowman</strong></em></blockquote><br><br>Mark Volescu spoke first. "Man, you didn't write this."<br><br>Steve grinned, "No I didn't. But I did send it."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Steve told them the name of the author.<br><br>"He's dead, dude."<br><br>"Maybe. They never did find his body."<br><br>"Yeah," said Volescu, "but I've read most of his stuff and I never read this."<br><br>"Well,
 right after we got back and I was discharged, I got on some gun rights 
e-mail lists and one of them was his. Anyway, he sent out a letter like 
this early one morning and then sent out another one a few hours later 
saying it was for review only, and he didn't mean for it to get out, and
 to please destroy any copies. He said he wasn't sure he was going to 
send it. Well, he didn't. It was right there at the line of being a 
threat to a federal official, so I guess he was advised by his friends 
not to send it. I never saw or heard anything more about it."<br><br>"If an empty threat falls on deaf ears, was it ever really said?" paraphrased Nijima, who was the deep thinker of the team.<br><br>"Let me venture a wild-assed guess," offered Volsecu, "you didn't delete your copy."<br><br>Avakian looked at his former SF team member and grinned.<br><br>"You're quick, Speedo." Volescu just grunted. He hated that nickname.<br><br>Steve
 continued. "But when I heard he was dead, I changed it a bit, wrapped 
it around a dubbed copy of this scene from Michael Collins and sent it 
to every US Representative and Senator. It put them on notice. Like 
Michael Collins, I had warned them. I'm sure the FBI figured out a dead 
man wrote it, but they musta been scratchin' their heads how he mailed 
it from beyond the grave."<br><br>"Yeah, well I noticed it didn't stop 'em from passing anything," Volescu retorted sourly.<br><br>"No,"
 admitted Avakian, "it didn't. Which is why they've got it coming now. 
There's way too many dead innocents on the ground now NOT to pay them 
back."<br><br>The men looked at one another. They loved Steve Avakian 
like a brother, and they knew now why they were here. They'd talked 
about it a hundred times on a theoretical level. And there had been 
worse laws since the Omnibus Crime Bill. People had died resisting them.
 There was a low intensity guerrilla conflict going on all over the 
country. The whole state of Alabama looked like it was going to war with
 the Feds because the administration had thrown the Constitution out the
 window and wouldn't let them run their own affairs.<br><br>Carter, Ball
 and Twigg had each taken a discharge at the same time as Avakian. 
Volescu followed with a general six months ago by framing himself as a 
security risk. You couldn't get out these days just by claiming you were
 a homosexual. "Don't ask, don't tell" had been junked by the new 
administration. Now it was "Hey, brag about it and you'll get promoted."<br><br>Nijima
 couldn't get released, his MOS was too sensitive, too needed. 
Consequently, Nijima was a deserter. There was a lot of that going 
around these days. CID was camped on his ex-wife's doorstep hoping he 
would surface there. Considering she was a faithless bitch who'd screwed
 around on "Nidge" when he was in Kandahar, it wasn't likely. But Nijima
 didn't mind them spying on her.<br><br>"Hell, Steve, you want us to help you kill the whole Congress?" This from Nijima.<br><br>"No,"
 said Avakian, "just these people. They're in our AO. I don't want to 
have to operate in DC, it ain't home ground. These are close by." He 
handed the other five men a sheet with 78 names on it.<br><br>"There's more than congresscritters on here," observed Mike Ball.<br><br>"Yeah,"
 explained Avakian, "there's TV talking heads, newspaper editors, U.S. 
Attorneys, supervisory federal policemen, and a grocery list of anti-gun
 politicians, local, state and national. I warned them too. Just notes, 
short and sweet: "You have been judged guilty of supporting, soliciting 
or assisting in the use of deadly force to impose a tyrannical scheme of
 gun control on the American people. Innocent Americans have died as a 
result. Renounce your opinions, quit your jobs, run and hide now and you
 can live. Continue with what you've been doing and you'll be killed as a
 legitimate target of war." And I signed it, 'The American Republican 
Army.'"<br><br>Steve looked around the room, then continued.<br><br>"Priority
 goes to the congressmen and senators who voted for the Omnibus Bill and
 Operation Clean Sweep. I didn't put just anybody on there. They are all
 there because they did some specific act or acts that carried out, or 
gave material assistance to, the unconstitutional operations of the 
administration. It's Clinton's ROE, applied to gun control."<br><br>Carter
 called out the name of a Hollywood actress, a real loud mouth who 
supported the regime with money and influence. "Hey, what's she on this 
list for?"<br><br>Avakian started to tell Carter about why he'd included
 her and Carter cut him off. "Yeah I know she's a commie bitch from 
Lesbos and she gave a lot of money to gun-control politicians, but what I
 meant was, why's she on OUR target list? She doesn't come from here."<br><br>Ball
 knew the answer to that one. "You don't watch 'Access Hollywood,' 
shithead. Her new girl-toy is from Lockwood and they got a love nest up 
by the ski resort. Right Steve?"<br><br>"You got it."<br><br>"She's hot," said Carter.<br><br>Ball,
 who had aced the LSAT and been accepted at Harvard Law, was mystified. 
"She's a lesbian, Mike, what does it matter to you that she's hot?"<br><br>"I know, but she's still hot. I want that job."<br><br>"Naw," said Nijima, "that's my job. I still haven't forgiven the bitch for raising money for the Taliban that time."<br><br>"Hell, Nidge," said Avakian, "we all want to kill her. We'll have to draw straws."<br><br>Twigg
 butted in. "How about we do it like some Agatha Christie novel? Like, 
we each shoot her at the same time with a different caliber of weapon? 
Let 'em try to figure that out."<br><br>They all jeered. "Agatha 
Christie?" groaned Avakian, "God, Twigg, you're a f-ckin' idiot." Nijima
 agreed and threw a couch cushion at him.<br><br>Willow ignored them and
 commented, "You know, you kill her and Hollywood's gonna empty out like
 a bunch of illegals out the back door of a bodega when somebody yells 
'La Migra!' in the front. There won't be a Hollywood commie left to shop
 on Rodeo Drive. They'll all go to the south of France for the 
duration."<br><br>"That's what I had in mind, Willow," replied Avakian.<br><br>Twigg's
 nickname was "Willow," because his first name was Will. Not William, 
not Willie, just Will. Also, because he was short and gutsy like that 
little dwarf character in the movie. His career had shown that his daddy
 had chosen his name well. For Will Twigg embodied every meaning of that
 word, except last will and testament, and maybe they'd get around to 
that one of these days.<br><br>Somebody, a long time ago, had tried 
calling him "Twiggy." The little guy from north Alabama had walked up to
 the bigger man, said "I'm sorry you said that," and dumped the bigger 
man's ass in the dirt so fast that nobody quite knew how he'd done it.<br><br>He
 then apologized, and offered the man a hand up. He was a devout 
Christian, and he never, ever cursed. They'd mocked him for it at first,
 until they realized he couldn't be angered and he lived what he 
believed. There was no doubt he was brave and he'd proved it too many 
times to recall. A small, compact man, he was stealthy beyond belief in 
the field.<br><br>Once, during an FTX back at Bragg, he snuck up to the 
OPFOR commander, a full bird Colonel who'd sent his RTO on some 
dogrobber job. Twigg raised up out of the weeds about 20 feet away with 
his MILES equipped M-4 and announced very softly. "You are my prisoner, 
Sir." The officer started to swear up one side and down the other, and 
Twigg reproved him. "Sir, you don't have to be profane or vulgar just 
because you lost."<br><br>That was Willow all over. He'd picked up 
reading Agatha Christie when they had been in the rear at Kabul. He 
bought the complete paperback set in the market. Dog eared when he got 
them, he read the murder mysteries until the covers fell off. How the 
books ever made it to Afghanistan, Avakian had no clue. Neither did 
Twigg. It wasn't a terrible vice for an explosives instructor to have, 
Avakian guessed, but it still was weird. At least he didn't knit in his 
downtime like Volescu, or make grotesque madman sketches like Carter.<br><br>He
 glanced around the room. Counting me, there's six apostles, not twelve.
 And "Willow" Twigg is my Vinny Byrne. Vinny had been the youngest man 
on Collin's "squad." So devout a young Catholic boy that he went to Mass
 both before and after his hits, Vinny would always say as he approached
 the victim from close range, "May the Lord have mercy on your soul," 
just before he pulled the trigger and blew his brains out.<br><br>There 
was no doubt that the Twelve Apostles had struck terror into the heart 
of the British establishment in Ireland. It was Collins' assassination 
campaign that compelled the Brits to seek a truce. Steve Avakian 
intended to do the same to the people who were responsible for this war.<br><br>It would be his own Operation Nemesis.<br><br><strong>"I have killed a man but I am not a murderer."</strong><br><br><blockquote><em><strong>When
 the war began in 1914 (Soghomon Tehlirian) said, Armenian soldiers, 
including his brother, were recruited into the Turkish army. Early in 
1915, however, most were stripped of all arms and employed as pack 
animals to transport army supplies, after which they were shot. In the 
villages posters announced that everyone had to surrender arms, but the 
Muslims were allowed to keep theirs while Armenians, when they complied,
 were charged as revolutionaries and tortured. Churches were desecrated 
and Christian symbols defiled. But these were only the initial moves by 
the Turkish authorities. In May came news that all Armenian schools had 
to be closed and the teachers, together with the community leaders, were
 sent to special camps. Shortly thereafter rumors spread that those who 
were taken away had already been killed. They had been given the 
alternative of renouncing Christianity, converting to Islam, and 
assuming Turkish names, but none had. In the months that followed only a
 small number of Armenians converted, for survival and to protect their 
families. At the beginning of June an order came . . . that the entire 
Armenian population should prepare to leave Erzinga. Money and other 
valuables had to be delivered to the Turkish authorities for 
safekeeping. Three days later the Armenian population of around twenty 
thousand was led from the town early in the morning. They were not 
permitted to take goods and personal belongings . . . The deportees were
 formed into a long caravan of five or six columns. . . Turkish soldiers
 and gendarmes were present on all sides. Everyone was very tired . . . 
On the very first day, members of Tehlirian's family were killed. . . 
Several gendarmes dragged his sister off and raped her, while another 
split his brother's head with an ax. His mother lay dead nearby, killed,
 he thought, by a bullet. . . Tehlirian suddenly felt a blow to his head
 and fell unconscious. He didn't know how long he lay there -- one or 
two days, he thought. When he awoke it was dark, and he felt a great 
weight on his body. To his horror he discovered that the burden was his 
brother's corpse. Tehlirian struggled until he was able to push his 
brother's body aside and stand up. Despite the darkness he could see 
corpses all around him, and he realized that the entire caravan had been
 killed. He was the sole survivor, left for dead by the Turks." -- A 
Crime of Vengeance: An Armenian Struggle for Justice by Edward 
Alexander, Free Press, 1991, p. 70</strong></em></blockquote><br><br>The
 Armenian Genocide by the Turkish Pashas of the old Ottoman Empire in 
1915 killed between a million and a million and a half Armenian 
Christians. It was characterized by the use of massacres and 
deportations involving forced marches without food or water designed to 
lead to the death of the deportees. Although condemned to death by the 
Turkish government that replaced them, most of the plotters -- who had 
killed no one themselves, merely having ordered it done -- escaped at 
the end of the war and settled down into comfortable lives in places 
like Germany.<br><br>To deliver justice upon them, the Armenian 
Revolutionary Federation crafted Operation Nemesis, a covert operation 
in the 1920s to assassinate these Turkish masterminds of the Genocide. 
It was named after the Greek goddess of divine retribution, Nemesis.<br><br>Hundreds
 of the guilty mass murderers were hunted down and executed by the 
assassins of the ARF in the 1920s. All this Steve Avakian knew by heart.
 When he was sixteen, his dad had handed him a book called 'A Crime of 
Vengeance', by Edward Alexander.<br><br>"You need to know where you came from," he told Steve. "Read this and we'll talk."<br><br><blockquote><em><strong>Now
 all eyes turned to the doorway through which entered a shy, nervous 
young man -- the accused Soghomon Tehlirian, seen for the first time by 
representatives of the world press. Clad in a black suit, he calmly 
walked to his place at the defense table. slight of figure and with 
slender features, the youth, though pale, seemed in control of himself. 
Now and then he looked around with what the press would call "the eyes 
of a fanatic," but his demeanor was gentle and restrained. . . The 
accused was then informed of the official charge against him:<br><br>"The
 alleged student of mechanical engineering, Soghomon Tehlirian . . . 
born on April 2, 1897, in Pakaritch, Turkey, a Turkish citizen, Armenian
 Protestant . . . is charged with intentionally having killed the former
 Turkish Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha in Charlottenburg on March 15, 1921, 
and of having carried out the killing with premeditation. . ."<br><br>Judge
 Lehmberg instructed the interpreters to inform the accused the contents
 . . . of the official charge. . . when the interpreters had finished, 
Judge Lehmberg turned to the accused: "How do you plead? Would you say 
yes or no to this accusation?"<br><br>"No." Defense Attorney von Gordon 
intervened and asked the court: "I request to ask the accused how he 
does not regard himself as guilty."<br><br>"I do not regard myself as 
guilty because my conscience is at peace." Judge Lehmberg immediately 
pursued that with a question. . . "How is your conscience at peace?"<br><br>"I have killed a man but I am not a murderer." -- A Crime of Vengeance, pp. 66-67</strong></em></blockquote><br><br>"Do
 you understand the difference?" his father had asked him. Steve was 
quiet for a moment. Finally he said, "Yeah, Dad, I get it. But how come 
no one ever talks about this?" he held up the slim hardback. "I've never
 heard of it before, except for stuff I overheard you and grandpa talk 
about before he died, stories about great grandpa Aram, and I didn't 
really understand that. They sure don't teach it in school."<br><br>"Well,
 your Grandpa wanted to tell you when you were little, but your mother 
wouldn't have any of it. She made me swear not to 'traumatize' you. But 
you're sixteen now. You've got a right to know. A right and a duty."<br><br>"A duty?"<br><br>"Yes,
 son, a duty. The Jews weren't the first people to say, 'Never again.' 
We Armenians were. Hitler used our genocide as a pattern for theirs. And
 some Jews used the book “The Forty Days of Musa Dagh” as an inspiration
 for last-ditch resistance.  Armenians were prominent in the fight 
against Nazism, and Armenian peasants in the Balkan countries and in 
Russia hid Jews. You see, they knew what it was like. And I want your 
promise that you'll never stand by and watch innocent people victimized 
by a government – any government, even our own. We Armenians have a duty
 to see that it never happens again, no matter what country we live in."<br><br>Steve
 Avakian had promised. But he never thought America could become such a 
country. He had grown up, joined the army, and seen how the rest of the 
world worked, and through it all he'd never thought that the American 
government could ever become that corrupt, that murderous, to its own 
people. He no longer thought that.<br><br>"So," said Volescu, "you got more than a list of names?"<br><br>"Yeah,"
 replied Steve Avakian, "I do." He started handing out files. "My 
thought was to do the Senators and Congressman first, all within 24 
hours. We begin on a holiday when they're all back in their home 
districts. Then we work our way down the second tier and see how far we 
get."<br><br>He paused. "You in?"<br><br>Surprisingly, Twigg was the first to reply, "Yeah, I'm in." And then he said simply, by way of explanation, "I took an oath."<br><br>They all nodded. So he had. So had they all. One by one they all committed, until only Nijima was left.<br><br>"Nidge?" prompted Avakian.<br><br>Nijima,
 his eyes closed, faked a snore, then an elaborate awakening. "Huh? Oh, 
yeah, what was you wanted me to do? Kill a bunch of evil Death Eaters, 
lesbian traitoresses, crooked government lawyers, pasty faced killer 
bureaucrats and panty waist editorial apologists, right? What's not to 
like?"<br><br>They all laughed.<br><br>Nidge continued, "Steve, it wounds me that you even thought you had to ask. I took an oath too, you know."<br><br>"Right," replied Avakian. "Sorry."<br><br>"So,"
 said Volescu, who besides being a champion knitter held a PhD in 
International Relations, "do we tell them who we are? Or are we just 
going to be anonymous?"<br><br>"I made up some death cards on my home 
computer. Printed them on card stock. What do you think?" He handed each
 team member a card.<br><br>"What a babe!" offered Volescu.<br><br>"Yeah," said Carter,"forget that lezzy bitch, this hottie has WINGS. I want a date with HER. What's her name?"<br><br>Steve Avakian smiled.<br><br>"Her name," he answered, "is Nemesis."<br><br><strong>Thirteen days later</strong><br><br>The
 problem was, being in a ski resort area where the rich, famous and 
well-connected came to play, they were suffering from an embarrassment 
of riches themselves – too many juicy targets.  Though many of them 
owned property in the team’s area of operations, once Nemesis began 
killing these members of the regime, the rest would scurry beyond reach 
into their green zones far away.<br><br>It also made sense to do the 
toughest jobs first.  Three of these hard targets were selected and both
 for target availability and for maximum impact it had been decided to 
do them simultaneously if possible.  Normally, the smallest formation 
they would have worked in was two teams of three, each with two 
operators to do the work and a “guardian angel” to watch over them.  A 
third target made that impossible.  And what of all those other worthies
 who would flee when the first shot was fired?<br><br>Looking at the topo map, it was Carter who solved the three-job problem.<br><br>As far as reaching out and touching the refugees, it was Nijima who provided the idea and Willow the means to execute it.<br><br>“You’re not the only one who’s read up on Irish history, Steve,” Nijima had said after he told them his idea.<br><br>“The problem is,” Avakian replied, “we don’t have access to enough explosives to do what you propose.”<br><br>“Aw,
 I dunno,” drawled Willow, “Why don’t you leave that to me?  I think I 
got a way to spread out what little we can get and make it all happen.  
It won’t be a loaves and fishes miracle, but it’ll work.”<br><br>Avakian was skeptical.  “How’s that?”<br><br>So Willow told him, in detail.  <br><br>“That’s
 brilliant!” said Steve.  The rest of the team nodded their heads with 
approval.  Nijima walked over and slapped him on the shoulder.  
“Outstanding, man, outstanding.”<br><br>“Shucks,” responded Willow 
modestly, “Taint nothin’ more than they taught us way back when – ‘take 
what the enemy gives you and use it against him.’”<br><br>And now, almost two weeks later, they were ready.<br><br>The
 prey were walking carefully these days, what with all the random 
killings going on all over the country.  They thought they were prudent,
 they thought they were safe.  Especially here in snow country, far away
 from the battlegrounds of the coasts.<br><br>It was true that they had 
made themselves hard targets.  Their homes had been hardened with what 
the experts represented as bullet-proof glass and fool-proof security 
systems.  Fences, gates and doors had been strengthened and armed 
bodyguards hired.  They WERE hard targets.  <br><br>It was just that they were wrong about everything else.  For Nemesis was coming to visit.<br><br>Stealing
 the propane company service truck two states away and repainting it in 
local colors had been tougher than stealing the recoilless rifle and its
 ammunition from the ski lodge.<br><br>It is a little known fact that 
the U.S. Army has for the past sixty years or so loaned light artillery 
on a semi-permanent basis to the private companies who operate ski 
slopes.  They do this for avalanche control purposes.<br><br>Most often 
these are recoilless rifles of 106mm caliber.  Off season, they are kept
 under strict lock and key.  Security precautions when they are being 
used are equally tough.  To the team, beneficiaries of some of the 
United States government’s best criminal training, it was easy as pie to
 lift the weapon, tripod and six rounds of high explosive ammo, along 
with a box of the special fifty caliber rounds for the spotting rifle 
mounted parallel to the recoilless that have the same ballistics as the 
main round.<br><br>The M40A1 106mm recoilless rifle is not really 106mm,
 but rather 105mm.  The Army added the extra millimeter to distinguish 
the rounds of the M40 from an earlier, unsuccessful recoilless rifle 
design  of 105mm bore.  It measures over 11 feet long and weighs almost 
300 pounds.  The M40 fires a 29 pound round at 1870 feet per second.  
Its maximum effective range for aimed shots is 2 kilometers.  For area 
fire it is almost eight klicks.<br><br>Now, the entire assembly was 
mounted on the ass-end of a long-bed pickup truck under a tarp, and the 
truck was backed up, sitting perched as far out as it could go on the 
rim of Lover’s Leap, a promontory that was just about equidistant from, 
and had line-of-sight to, the mountain retreats of a certain hollywood 
star with treasonous tendencies and a sitting United States Senator who 
had violated his oath by supporting Operation Clean Sweep.  This was the
 spot that Carter had identified on the topo map.<br><br>It was ten 
minutes until two o’clock on a Sunday morning.   The tarp was pulled 
off.  The parking brake was set, the wheels were chocked and the springs
 were jammed with steel shims to keep the vehicle bed from shifting as 
the long barrel swung from target to target.  Each estate was well lit, 
making targeting simple.<br><br> Both targets were abed and asleep.   The star had someone in her bed.  The Senator did not.<br><br>“What about the girl-toy, isn’t she an innocent?” Willow had asked.  Nijima had an answer for that.<br><br>“They
 met at the Taliban fundraiser, Will,” Nidge said harshly. “She also 
signed the celebrity petition for the ban.  They’re both domestic 
enemies.”<br><br>Willow had shrugged.  “OK, just makin’ sure.”<br><br>“And are we sure about the rest of innocents?  The maids and so on?” Ball asked.<br><br>Carter
 answered that one.  He had done the recon of the sites with a powerful 
spotting scope and a Simrad laser range finder from the vantage point of
 Lover’s Leap.<br><br>“If the intel we got from open sources is right, 
and I’m sure it is, her bedroom is second-floor northwest corner, so the
 rounds, if we put them on target, are going to penetrate wall and 
window facing us and blow out the adjoining wall at an angle away from 
the other rooms.  The Senator’s bedroom is north-east on the third 
floor, giving us a similar oblique shot.  Because the outer walls at 
that end of the house are brick, I don’t expect the rounds to blow out 
the adjoining wall but rather to be contained in the room.  Better Homes
 and Gardens had a photo showing the bedroom with a stone fire place and
 chimney on the opposite wall in the bedroom which should help to 
contain the blast to the Senator’s personal discomfort.  In any case, 
the hired help are all on the lower floors.  If we hit it dead-on, there
 shouldn’t be a problem.”<br><br>“That recoilless is going is going to 
light up the night,” Volescu cautioned.  “We’re going to have to make, 
what, two shots minimum on the first target, shift, and fire two more?  
That doesn’t count the spotting rounds.  And that position is visible 
from lots of places across the valley and surrounding ridges.  There 
aren’t that many routes by which we can exfil.  What if some sheriff’s 
deputy on patrol gets there before we can boogie?”<br><br>“Don’t worry, 
Vol,” said Avakian, “Willow’s going to make sure that they have plenty 
more to look at, and worry about.  My bet is, nobody will be able to 
pick out the recoilless from everything else that’s going to be 
happening.”<br><br><blockquote><em><strong>The British are, of course, a
 people well practised down the centuries in the use of fire as an 
instrument of terror.  It has been said that they reached the peak of 
perfection in this art in Ireland after the Rising of 1798, but I do not
 think this is correct.  Surely they excelled in the war for the 
conquest of South Africa, when they failed to defeat in the field a 
handful of Boer riflemen, but succeeded in forcing their surrender by 
the mass burnings of Boer homesteads and the imprisonment, under 
appalling conditions, of Boer women and children, many thousands of whom
 died.  So in 1920 and 1921, the British would use against the Irish the
 instrument which was so successful against the Boers, previous 
generations of the Irish and other subject races.  There was, however, 
one all important factor which the British evidently forgot to take into
 consideration.  While the South Africans had no British Loyalists’ 
homes which could be destroyed as reprisals, Ireland was studded with 
castles, mansions and residences of the British Ascendancy who had made 
their homes here.  The West Cork Brigade was slow to commence a campaign
 of counter-burnings, but eventually action was taken.  A note was sent 
to the British Military Commander in west Cork, informing him that for 
every Republican home destroyed from that date, the homes of two British
 Loyalists would be burned to the ground.<br><br>The British ignored 
this threat and two nights afterwards burned out a small farmhouse and 
labourer’s cottage.  The following night the I.R.A. burned out four 
large Loyalists’ residences in the same neighbourhood.  The British 
countered by burning four farmhouses and we promptly burned out the 
eight largest Loyalists’ homes in that vicinity.  And so the British 
terror and the I.R.A.  counter-terror went on.  Castles, mansions and 
residences were sent up in flames by the I.R.A. immediately after the 
British fire gangs had razed the homes of Irish Republicans.  Our people
 were suffering in this competition of terror, but the British loyalists
 were paying dearly, the demense walls were tumbling and the British 
Ascendancy was being destroyed.  Our only fear was that, as time went 
on, there would be no more Loyalists’ homes to destroy, for we intended 
to go on to the bitter end. . .<br><br>Very soon after our campaign of 
counter-burnings commenced an outcry arose from the British Loyalists 
themselves, demanding that the British forces should cease destroying 
Republican homes, as otherwise they too would be treated likewise. . . 
British peers in  their House of Lords and members of the House of 
Commons, dyed in the wool Imperialists, who would gladly have destroyed 
the home of every Irish Nationalist, echoed those appeals. . . This 
outcry had its effect, and although British burnings were never 
officially called off, they were slowed down considerably and even 
halted for a time.  Once again the British had reacted to the only sure 
method of meeting their terrorism, an effective counter-terror.  – Tom 
Barry, Guerrilla Days in Ireland: A Personal Account of the Anglo-Irish 
War, pp. 116-117.</strong></em></blockquote><br><br>It was Willow who 
had worked the hardest to set up the multiple strikes.  He thought of it
 as preparing the broad canvas upon which the other team members would 
sketch in their smaller, but more vital, contributions.<br><br>For all 
of their various locations and security precautions, there was one thing
 that all of the targets' homesteads had in common: they were all heated
 by propane storage tanks, some underground and some above, but all of 
them filled and serviced regularly by the MountainWest Corporation, 
known as MoWesCo.<br><br>With the stolen gas service truck repainted in 
MoWesCo colors and Will Twigg dressed in a company uniform, the 
demolitions expert paid a “pre-season inspection visit” to 15 vacation 
properties belonging to regime supporters.  At the estates where 
security guards or house sitters watched over the property, this was 
accepted as perfectly normal.  At each property, Willow installed a new 
“leak warning system,” as he explained it to those who maintained 
residence there, instructing them on the necessity to evacuate the 
premises without delay if, in the wildly unlikely event,  they ever 
heard it.  He reinforced this message with graphic photographs of 
previous propane tank explosions he had downloaded from the Internet at 
the public library in Cantor (where there were no surveillance cameras),
 neatly displayed in a MoWesCo three-ring binder he’d picked up at a 
thrift store in Lockwood.  The guards and house-sitters were suitably 
impressed at this extra precaution taken for their safety.<br><br>Of course, Willow explained, there would be no charge for this new company service.  <br><br>He lied.<br><br>Now
 despite what you have seen in Hollywood action fakeries, propane 
contained in well-maintained tanks is actually rather hard to detonate 
with both reliability and maximum effect.  The best way is to suddenly 
compromise the tank so that the gas leaks out rapidly into a cloud and 
then detonate the cloud with a second charge in a low-order fuel-air 
explosion.  This takes knowledge and experience.  Willow had both.  <br><br>It
 took him three long days, shuttling about on county roads, to install 
the very visible alarms and the invisible demolitions and their 
triggering mechanisms.  Nowhere did anyone question him about what he 
was doing.  He, like them, was hired help, unimportant and eminently 
ignorable.<br><br>Now, at six minutes to H-Hour, Will Twigg pulled a 
cell phone out of his pocket and pushed a speed-dial number.  In fifteen
 houses spread out over almost twenty-two square miles, alarms began to 
sound, and frightened people tumbled out of bed, and fled the premises 
as fast as they could go.<br><br>Willow gave them five minutes, and 
speed-dialed another number.  You could hear, with various sound levels,
 the reports of the cutting charges.  When the first ignition charge 
went off with a distant flash and boom, the recoilless, with Steve 
Avakian as gunner and Will Twigg as loader, fired the first spotting 
round at the Senator’s house 1600 meters distant.<br><br>Normally, in 
avalanche work, the 106s were fired from enclosures by remote control 
since there had been a few cases of deadly in-tube detonations which had
 occurred thanks to defective, over-age ammunition.  Here, the team 
would not have time to use such protection.  The rounds had to be fired 
as swiftly as possible to catch the targets in their beds.  That meant 
risk.  Steve Avakian had briefed them all of the dangers and asked for 
volunteers.  To a man, they all were willing.  Steve chose Willow 
because the firing of the recoilless had to be closely coordinated with 
the detonation of Twigg’s charges anyway.  Nidge was in overwatch back 
where the access to Lover’s Leap met the county highway.<br><br>Spotting
 rounds have an incendiary composition in the projectile so that when it
 slams into the target the gunner can see the flash and know that he can
 fire the main charge and hit within a foot or two.  If, that is, 
everything works right.  The spotting round struck the bricks on the 
outside wall about six feet above Senator Richland Hamilton’s head, 
glancing away without much penetration because of the angle, but waking 
him from an erotic dream involving the First Lady of the United States.<br><br>“What the hell?!?” he exclaimed as he rolled out of bed, naked as the day his mother brought him into the world.<br><br>Avakian
 immediately held up his left hand to warn Willow, closed his eyes to 
preserve his night vision and fired the main gun.  Even with double 
hearing protection the explosion of hot gasses out the back of the 
recoilless was painful to the hearing of both men and the concussion 
slammed at the air in their lungs.  The flash would have blinded them 
had they not had their eyes shut.  The broad blast cone blew the windows
 out of the pickup truck and inside the seat covers and dash began to 
burn.<br><br>A 106 round, even at 1870 feet per second, takes a bit to 
reach a target that is a kilometer and a half away.  Had it been 
daylight and if Senator Hamilton had possessed x-ray vision, he might 
have seen death approaching.<br><br>As it wasn’t and he couldn’t, 
Richland Hamilton was still wondering what to do, and bemused by his 
erection, when the high explosive blew in his bedroom wall and tore off 
the top of his head, as well as other body parts.  The second round that
 followed, struck the wall four feet to the left and lower down and 
deposited his mutilated body out the opposite wall’s window and left it 
hanging upside down in a tall pine tree.  <br><br>This would later complicate the county medical examiner’s job.<br><br>All
 things being more or less equal, the distance between Senator 
Hamilton’s death and the sleeping ears of Daisy O’Connell was a little 
over 2 kilometers.  The crack of the spotting round didn’t wake her up. 
 The reverberating “boom . . . BOOM!” of the first round did, despite 
the sleeping pill she had taken.  By the time the second round blew the 
remains of Richland Hamilton out his window, both she and Felicia were 
moving toward their own double-reinforced bullet-resistant window.<br><br>As
 the big recoilless rifle swung toward them in the darkness beyond the 
illumination of the lodge’s exterior lights, they stared out the window 
toward the fires that were licking out from the holes in Senator 
Hamilton’s bedroom walls.<br><br>Steve Avakian saw them through the 
sight in the reflected yard lights.  Fearing they might figure out what 
was about to happen to them and knowing that the range was almost 
identical to his first two shots, he dispensed with the spotting round. 
 <br><br>Up went his left hand, he closed his eyes, and pulled the 
trigger.  The backblast flash got Felicia’s attention, and she pointed, 
exclaiming “What was tha . . .”<br><br>The 106 projectile hit the “bullet-proof” window’s bottom ledge, about four feet to the couple’s left.<br><br>Given the angle and the proximity of the explosion, there was no need for a second shot.<br><br>Which
 was a good thing, because the cab of the pickup was now well enveloped 
in flames.  So, too, was much of the nearby brush.  There was nothing to
 do but leave, which they did, driving away in the propane company truck
 down the road with flames on both sides.  They paused only long enough 
to pick up Nijima at the junction, and then they proceeded as if nothing
 had happened, and drove to the rally point.<br><br>Carter, Ball and 
Volescu had the easiest assignment.  Congressman Haynes’ chalet was 
further down the ridge from two of Willow’s propane jobs.  When the 
warning horns began to sound, they woke up the Congressman and his wife,
 who came out on their back deck just in time to see both estates blown 
to smithereens.  At that moment, Volescu, who was sitting in a hide with
 Ball as his spotter about 725 meters away, put a .338 Lapua Magnum 
bullet just above his sternum.  His wife was convinced that a piece of 
shrapnel from one of the nearby explosions must have killed her husband.
  The coroner didn’t think so, and the autopsy proved his suspicions had
 been correct.<br><br>By the next morning, two newspaper editors, 
another congressman and three supervisory employees of the ATF and FBI 
were dead.  People identified with the administration, gun control and 
especially Operation Clean Sweep continued to die with regularity over a
 period of about five weeks.  By that time, everyone on Steve Avakian’s 
list was dead or had fled the team’s area of operations.<br><br>At two 
that afternoon, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation flew
 in to get a personal briefing on the death of Senator Hamilton.  At 
4:52PM, while he was touring the senator’s ravaged estate with a bevy of
 press, someone shot the Director through his body armor with a .50 
caliber Barrett bolt-action rifle from 1205 meters away. <br><br>Even experts said it was an impossible shot.<br><br>He died at the Lockwood City Hospital two hours later.<br><br>It
 took the FBI two days to find the sniper’s hide.  As with the other 
crime scenes, there was little forensic evidence to identify the 
perpetrators.<br><br>His killer was never identified, and in time the 
Director became just another statistic of the latest American civil war 
that the administration he served had done its best to start.<br><br>The only thing that tied all the cases together was an image found at, or mailed to, the address of each victim.<br><br>It
 was a death card with the classical painting of a Greek goddess on it 
-- Nemesis, the avenger of crime and the punisher of hubris.

I haven't read any of the chapters yet. I have been waiting to buy the 
complete book. Actually a number of them for distribution to friends, 
hopefully as Christmas gifts. How many more chapters are you planning? 
If you post a link to pre-purchase some I would gladly do it. I know you
 are a man of honor and once people started sending in their money I 
know that would serve to expedite the whole process as you would feel 
obligated. See how self-serving I am!

The letter in your story written by "Henry Bowman" is the exact letter 
that needs to be sent to those in power!!!!   Those are the words that 
American Patriots are waiting to hear.

As a descendant of Armenian grandparents, who never knew his grandfather
 (killed by the Otomans) I just can't wait to purchase  your book. My 
god, is it ever so close to what I heard from the elders as a child.

"Henry Bowman" is the main character in John Ross' book, "Unintended 
Consequences".  It is my understanding that the flight path of a .50 cal
 at 1200 meters is nearly vertical.  I may be mistaken however.

I would hat for that burned out pick-up with the recoilless rifle in the
 back to be traced back to be by the local LEO's.  Even if they are 
OathKeepers I bet they would be pissed off at the registered owner of 
the truck. Nice list of the scum to get rid of but I refer to my list as
 the "Christmas Card List" and it includes the Bilderberg Group, Council
 on Foreign Relations &amp; the Trilateral Commission as well as the 
local clones of the targeted clowns in this story.  I would bet money 
that G. Soros is the Puppetmaster of the Clown in the White House. <br>III &amp; Keep The Faith.

<h2 class="title">"Progress made under the shadow of the policeman's club is false progress."</h2>
<div class="widget-content">
I believe that liberty is the only genuinely valuable thing that men 
have invented, at least in the field of government, in a thousand years.
 I believe that it is better to be free than to be not free, even when 
the former is dangerous and the latter safe. I believe that the finest 
qualities of man can flourish only in free air – that progress made 
under the shadow of the policeman's club is false progress, and of no 
permanent value. I believe that any man who takes the liberty of another
 into his keeping is bound to become a tyrant, and that any man who 
yields up his liberty, in however slight the measure, is bound to become
 a slave. -- H.L. Mencken<br>

 fate of unborn Millions will now depend, under God, on the Courage and 
Conduct of this army-Our cruel and unrelenting Enemy leaves us no choice

<h2 class="title">"We will not go gently . . ."</h2>
<div class="widget-content">
This is no small thing, to restore a republic after it has fallen into 
corruption. I have studied history for years and I cannot recall it ever
 happening. It may be that our task is impossible. Yet, if we do not try
 then how will we know it can't be done? And if we do not try, it most 
certainly won't be done. The Founders' Republic, and the larger war for 
western civilization, will be lost.<br><br>But I tell you this: We will 
not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will 
make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward
 will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.<br><br>And
 when we are gone, the scattered, free survivors hiding in the ruins of 
our once-great republic will sing of our deeds in forbidden songs, 
tending the flickering flame of individual liberty until it bursts forth
 again, as it must, generations later. We will live forever, like the 
Spartans at Thermopylae, in sacred memory.<br><br>-- Mike Vanderboegh, The Lessons of Mumbai:Death Cults, the "Socialism of Imbeciles" and Refusing to Submit, 1 December 2008<br>

<h2 class="title">"A common language of resistance . . ."</h2>
<div class="widget-content">
<strong><em>"Colonial rebellions throughout the modern world have been 
acts of shared political imagination.  Unless unhappy people develop the
 capacity to trust other unhappy people, protest remains a local affair 
easily silenced by traditional authority.  Usually, however, a moment 
arrives when large numbers of men and women realize for the first time 
that they enjoy the support of strangers, ordinary people much like 
themselves who happen to live in distant places and whom under normal 
circumstances they would never meet.  It is an intoxicating discovery.  A
 common language of resistance suddenly opens to those who are most 
vulnerable to painful retribution the possibility of creating a new 
community.  As the conviction of solidarity grows, parochial issues and 
aspirations merge imperceptibly with a compelling national agenda which 
only a short time before may have been the dream of only a few.  For 
many Americans colonists this moment occurred late in the spring of 
1774."  --  T.H. Breen, The Marketplace of Revolution: How Consumer 
Politics Shaped American Independence, Oxford University Press, 2004, 
p.1.</em></strong><br>
