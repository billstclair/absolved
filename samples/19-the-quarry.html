 Adjutant General of the State of Alabama was unhappy. He didn't like 
the informal place of this meeting, he didn't like Jack Durer and he 
didn't like the way events were pushing him.<br><br>He was painfully 
aware that he was a man very much in the middle. He'd had a long 
conversation two nights ago with the Secretary of Defense of the United 
States, a conversation he wasn't about to mention to the Governor. The 
SecDef had made it plain -- the Adjutant General had sworn his first 
oath to the United States, not to the state of Alabama -- and that in a 
federal system, it was the nation which came first. Something else was 
made plain to him -- his Army pension was on the line if he didn't play 
ball with Washington. Ray Marsh was a long-time friend and 
philosophically the Adjutant General was right there with the Governor.<br><br>But not if he had to work as a greeter at WalMart to pay the bills.<br><br>This
 morning, he had met with the FBI man who had been designated as his 
contact and had passed over documents detailing what he knew about the 
shipment of Taiwanese arms now sitting, he thought, at the Mobile Docks.
 God, how many federal laws would be broken if Ray Marsh got involved in
 that?<br><br>He looked up from the coffee table at his feet to see Jack
 Durer standing across the room, murmuring to Billy Mitchell. Only Durer
 wasn't looking at the Director of the Department of Public Safety as he
 spoke, he was looking at . . . me, the Adjutant General realized with a
 start. And at that moment, Jack Durer did something even more 
unsettling.<br><br>He winked.<br><br>The SOB just winked at me. What's that bastard up to now?<br><br>The Governor came in from the sewing room, where he had been on his knees praying for guidance.<br><br>"Gentlemen,
 thank you all for coming. I apologize for the setting, but it was vital
 that these conversations remain confidential, and my official offices 
in Montgomery are now all wired for sound by the federal authorities. So
 are my private residences, in both Montgomery and at home."<br><br>The 
Governor nodded at the Attorney General, who was sitting on the other 
end of the couch from the Adjutant General, "Robert has advised me to 
leave them in place, as has Jack Durer, each for their own arcane 
reasons. As we said before, please keep this in mind when calling or 
visiting me."<br><br>Ray Marsh's attention fixed on the Adjutant 
General. "General Baxter, would you start us out by giving us your 
report on the various National Guard elements and how they would react 
to being federalized?"<br><br>This was the topic he had been told was 
the subject of this meeting. He didn't believe it. The earth was moving 
under their feet -- the federal avalanche was coming -- and Ray Marsh 
was too convinced of his own God's divine assistance and perfect 
judgment to back off. No, they were all accomplished and intelligent 
men. They knew, as did Baxter, that the Democrat Lieutenant Governor's 
wife was already measuring the Governor's Mansion in her mind for new 
curtains. The smart money of Montgomery's Old Guard of both parties was 
betting against Ray Marsh being in office much longer. But these men did
 not look hunted, or beaten. They were up to something. He'd bet his 
pension on it. Then he realized, I already have.<br><br>"In a word, 
sir," Baxter replied, "if they are federalized, they will obey. Some 
will stay home. Some will drag their boots. But they will obey."<br><br>"I
 see," said the Governor absently, his mind obviously on something else.
 "And the State Defense Force? How would you rate their readiness?"<br><br>Baxter
 was astounded at the stupidity of the question. He also commanded the 
ASDF but it was hardly more than a coffee-drinkers' club for old 
veterans who needed an excuse to spend drill nights and occasional 
weekends away from their spouses.<br><br>"Sir, the present operational 
readiness of the Alabama State Defense Force is zero point zero." He 
paused, then a thought occurred to him, "Surely, sir, you are not 
intending to oppose the federalized Alabama National Guard, or even 
federal police agencies, with the ASDF? That would be insanity. Insanity
 and the ultimate exercise in futility. Good men would be killed, to no 
purpose."<br><br>Surely not, Baxter thought. Surely.<br><br>"No, that coincides with my opinion, as well," replied the Governor.<br><br>Baxter relaxed, which was, given the circumstances, entirely premature.<br><br>"General
 Baxter, I would like your resignation before you leave here this 
morning. It will take effect in 90 days. You have plainly failed in your
 duty, required by Alabama law, to provide this state with a trained and
 competent state defense force."<br><br>"What?!?" Baxter blurted out.<br><br>"I
 would have thought what I said was simple and direct. There are, 
however, a couple of other... special circumstances . . . that you will 
be required to fufill before you leave office. Colonel Mitchell and Mr. 
Durer will explain those to you as you leave."<br><br>"If you think you can get away with this . . ."<br><br>"I'm
 sorry General, I already have. Billy and Jack will explain to you why 
it is in your own best interests for you to comply and leave your 
position quietly."<br><br>Huh? thought Baxter dully through his anger.<br><br>"This
 way, General," said Jack Durer, motioning toward himself with his index
 finger like a patiently indulgent parent calling a three-year old over 
to him. Baxter was also aware of one of the Governor's protective 
detail, brought into the room as Ray Marsh had pronounced the end of the
 General's career. He now stood quietly but ominously behind the couch, 
in case Baxter decided to make a scene.<br><br>He did not. He was a 
Major General of the United States Army National Guard, by God, and he 
would leave as he had lived. With honor, dignity and under his own 
power. He stood to attention, and though it was not called for, he put 
his cover on his head, faced the Governor and saluted. Then, and only 
then, did he allow himself to follow Jack Durer and Billy Mitchell from 
the room. The bodyguard followed.<br><br>They passed through the house 
and then out into the breezeway and the garage beyond. There, in one of 
the bays, was a table. Upon it was a file folder, some pens and a tape 
recorder. Arrayed around it were three folding chairs.<br><br>"Have a seat, General," invited Billy Mitchell.<br><br>"I think not," Baxter said icily. "I'm leaving."<br><br>"Going
 where, General? Back to your wife at home or to the arms of your 
'comfort woman' Lieutenant Hansen at Headquarters?" Jack Durer asked 
brutally.<br><br>Baxter spun on his heel. "It that what this is about? Blackmail?" he demanded.<br><br>"Have a seat," said Mitchell, almost gently, "and we'll tell you what this is about."<br><br>Baxter sat.<br><br>"That'll be all, Phil," Billy Mitchell said to the bodyguard, who vanished at his boss' command.<br><br>"Look, you two . . ." began Baxter.<br><br>"Shut
 up, General," ordered Durer. "For once in your life, shut your big fat 
mouth and listen. We're willin' to make you a deal. Listen to the deal, 
and then make up your mind."<br><br>Billy Mitchell opened, "First, 
General, let's talk about what we know about you and your recent 
activities." He pushed the play button on the tape recorder. It was 
Baxter's own voice talking to the Secretary of Defense of the United 
States and promising, among other things, to do whatever the SecDef 
wanted to help get rid of Ray Marsh as Governor of the State of Alabama.<br><br>Baxter was astounded. "How," he began.<br><br>Jack
 Durer smiled. "Yeah, I know. How did we know to tap that phone, when we
 couldn't have known which one you would use? How were we able to record
 and untwist an encrypted conversation? Life is full of questions, 
General. But let me tell you this, the questions of life are not half as
 important to you personally right now as the ANSWERS. It doesn't matter
 HOW we got this tape. What matters is what we DO with it."<br><br>Billy
 Mitchell, continued sympathetically. "Look, General, no matter how this
 ends -- whether Ray Marsh is still governor or not -- if this tape ever
 gets out you'll be the biggest traitor of all time in some folks' eyes:
 bigger than Benedict Arnold and right up there with Judas Iscariot. 
You'll be known as the feller who threw in his lot with the people who 
sent those cop-killin' Brightfire murderers among us. There's relatives 
of dead men in Winston County who'll track you down and kill you for 
that alone. You'll have to leave the state -- your lifelong home -- for 
your own safety, and you'll NEVER be able to come back. You see that, 
don't you? So hear us out. Show him what else we have on him, Jack. 
Don't leave him hanging."<br><br>When Durer finished ten minutes later, 
Baxter realized that his federal pension meant nothing. These bastards 
had him by the short and curlies. They even knew about the expense 
account skimming. If they want, they can throw me in jail right now, my 
life and reputation ruined forever.<br><br>"Here's the deal," said Durer
 when he finished. "No matter what you want, when you walk out of this 
room without your job -- and you will whether you sign the papers or not
 -- the federals won't do a thing for you. You're of no use to them 
without your position, and that you do not have. And one other thing. If
 you're bettin' on that moron of a Lieutenant Governor gettin' Ray 
Marsh's job anytime soon so he can get you your own job back, I 
wouldn't. Look at your file. What kind of file do you think I've been 
able to compile on that corrupt shithead? Don't bet on him, you'll lose.
 Bet on us. It's safer."<br><br>"What do you want me to do?" asked Baxter in defeat.<br><br>And so they told him.<br><br>When
 Jack Durer and Billy Mitchell returned to the living room, they found 
the new acting Adjutant General of Alabama chatting with the Governor 
and the Attorney General.<br><br>"Billy," asked the Governor, "have you met General Wilson before?"<br><br>"No, I haven't had the pleasure, but of course Jack's had a lot of good things to say about him."<br><br>As
 the two men shook hands, Wilson said, "You know, I've often wondered if
 there was anybody in the state of Alabama that Jack Durer DOESN'T 
know."<br><br>They all looked at the older man. "Well," Jack admitted begrudgingly, "maybe two or three."<br><br>The Governor brought them back to business. "Is General Baxter going to play ball by our rules?"<br><br>Billy
 Mitchell spoke first. "Why, Governor, after Jack here got done showing 
the General satellite photos of the birthmark on his penis from three 
different angles, he was quite agreeable."<br><br>"A birthmark on his penis?" the Attorney General asked.<br><br>"Metaphorically speaking, sir. Merely metaphorically speaking," said Billy.<br><br>Jack Durer just grinned.<br><br>"Well," said the Governor, "that's a relief."<br><br>They all laughed.<br><br>"All
 right," the Governor said, "back to the issues at hand. I won't bore 
you, or embarrass General Wilson, by singing his praises in detail. 
Suffice it to say that he's Alabama's most decorated Marine officer, and
 I am told that the only reason he didn't make Commandant of the Corps 
before he retired was that he is absolutely incapable of kissing any 
politician's butt, in or out of uniform, and that includes my own. Hal 
shares our vision of the Founders' Republic, he is incorruptible and in 
any case he's independently wealthy so he can't be bought by a threat to
 his pension, like poor Baxter there. More importantly, as much as I 
hate to admit it being an Army veteran, the Marines are the best at 
training light infantrymen, and that's the job he'll have -- getting the
 ASDF up to snuff in a hurry."<br><br>Jack Durer couldn't resist. "Well, I'm glad you didn't praise him, boss," he said with his trademark grin.<br><br>The
 Governor gave that just a thin smile in return. "General, in the 
interest of bringing you up to speed on my 'commander's intent,' as it 
were, let me recap the task we have before us. In order to give Robert's
 legal plan a chance to work, we have to buy time. At the same time we 
must prepare for any eventuality, including what happens if our 
brilliant maneuvering fails.<br><br>It seems plain that our first job is
 to keep order. That means no more Sipsey Streets and no more Winston 
County Massacres. Billy is spending most of ABI's time keeping track of 
the federal agents in Alabama. Jack is working the 
intelligence/counter-intelligence end of things with both outside help 
from his friends across the world and some of Billy's very best men. We 
must also keep the hotheads of our own people, the militias and so on, 
from taking it upon themselves to attack the Federals in retribution.<br><br>Now,
 there is nothing we can do outside of the boundaries of this state, and
 it would seem that other states, especially the "blue" areas for lack 
of a better term, are going to experience a rising tide of violence from
 their own frustrated people as the laws are tightened on them. For our 
part, Alabama MUST be an island of stability in a stormy sea. I cannot 
emphasize that enough. We MUST remain at peace as long as possible. And 
if the break finally does come, it must be the administration that is 
plainly seen by all as the aggressor. Are you with me so far?"<br><br>They all nodded, knowing how difficult that would be.<br><br>And there was more. Much more.<br><br>The Governor took a sip of water from the glass on the sideboard next to his chair.<br><br>"Now,
 to a certain extent, this is going to work in our favor. Here's Alabama
 trying to arrive at a legal solution to the attacks upon her citizens 
while other more liberal states are engaged in an escalating spiral of 
violence. But in the end, the administration in Washington is finally 
going to recognize that, because of our political legitimacy, Alabama is
 the greater threat to them. They will not want to concede our main 
point, which is that if the republic is to be preserved intact, the 
states must return to a time when they had much more autonomy."<br><br>"Robert
 has been in contact with his counterparts in many other states, mostly 
in the south and mountain west. They are willing to join us in certain 
legal maneuvers, but not others. And no one else is in the position that
 we are to push this as far as we can. Alabama will lead the way, 
gentlemen, along a tough and lonely road, so there must be no errors, no
 miscalculations. And anytime you think that I'm headed in the wrong 
direction on any particular point, I want to hear it. But let one thing 
be perfectly clear. There will be no more innocent Alabama citizens 
victimized by this federal administration or their mercenary toadies 
while I am Governor. If we hear of a raid coming down, we will maneuver 
whatever forces we have on the spot to get in between the feds and their
 intended victims. Are we all clear on that?"<br><br>They all nodded assent. The General said it out loud, "Yes, sir."<br><br>"And
 if, God forbid, we arrive too late to get in between them and their 
prey, I want us on the Feds' backs so tightly that they will think twice
 of burning any churches down with babies in them to cover their 
mistakes. I admit that this increases rather than decreases the 
likelihood of violent confrontation between federal forces and our own. 
But I am not going to stand by idly again while the feds kill our 
citizens. I am the duly elected governor of Alabama and not some federal
 errand boy who gets told about things after the fact like the Sipsey 
Street business."<br><br>"So, the first thing we must do is keep order 
with the slim resources we have. The second thing is to build up the 
peacekeeping strength of the state to meet future challenges.<br><br>Robert
 believes, and I concur, that there is enough statutory authority for us
 to dramatically expand the Alabama State Defense Force into a 
Swiss-style militia system. From the ferment in the state that these 
federal attacks have generated, as well as threat of further oppressive 
laws in the works, we do not lack for volunteers to our cause. Nor, with
 the addition of General Wilson do we lack in our ability to train light
 infantrymen. What we lack are resources.<br><br>Fortunately, General 
Chen Chao-yeh has come to our rescue with a boatload of Type 57 rifles, a
 million rounds of 7.62 NATO ball ammunition and various and sundry 
other goodies from Taiwanese arsenals. The General offered to sell these
 to the state and I accepted," and here he glanced over at the Attorney 
General with a smile, "without benefit of expert legal advice. Now 
Robert tells me we are on firmer ground by seizing them as we would with
 any other firearms found in the hands of those without legal right to 
possess them. As in the case of a machine gun seized from a dope dealer 
by a local police department, we are within rights to simply put them in
 safe storage and later, if we choose, to use them for lawful training. I
 have informed the departments of State and Customs as well as the ATF, 
that the General's arms were seized at the dock by the state. Robert has
 duly investigated the matter," and here he gave the Attorney General a 
wink, "and discovered that since Chen Chao-yeh declared them when the 
boat docked and made no attempt to smuggle them in contrary to law, he 
is blameless of any violation of law and therefore will not be 
prosecuted by the state."<br><br>General Wilson spoke up, "Governor, a 
million rounds SOUNDS like a lot of ammunition but it really isn't, not 
when we have to burn up a LOT in marksmanship training. But sir, exactly
 how many Type 57 rifles did the General bring?"<br><br>"Ten thousand."<br><br>General Harold Allen Wilson let out a low whistle. "Well, that's a good start."<br><br>Jack Durer interjected, "There were some other goodies on the Hai Tong you'll want to see, Hal."<br><br>"Were?" asked the General.<br><br>"Yeah,"
 said Billy Mitchell, "we've got all of it secured in a warehouse in 
Montgomery under 24 hour guard by state troopers. Already caught two 
feds trying to sneak in to see what's there."<br><br>"What did you do to them?" asked the General.<br><br>Ray Marsh and Robert Williams just smiled. They knew the story already.<br><br>"Well,"
 said Mitchell, "the troopers didn't think their FBI badges were real, 
you know, so they disarmed 'em and had Montgomery PD book 'em on 
attempted breaking and entering of state property. Mug shots, the whole 
nine yards. They couldn't deny the burglar tools they were carryin'. So 
anyway, we held 'em in the drunk tank until we had to give 'em their 
phone call, see? Then their boss comes tear-assin' down from Birmingham 
to personally identify 'em and so we apologize very sweetly and 
sincerely and let them go forth to sin no more. But not before some of 
Jack's brighter proteges had a chance to download everything from their 
cell phones and laptops and go through their car. Interesting stuff in 
there, wasn't there Jack?"<br><br>"Yeah, those boys sure don't 
understand the concept of operational security, they surely don't. 
They're so used to doin' stuff to other folks they never considered it 
could be done to them. Poor unfortunate lambs. Our federal tax dollars 
surely don't buy what they used to."<br><br>The General laughed. Once again it was the Governor who brought them back on track.<br><br>"So,
 Hal, we have the volunteers, the rifles, and enough ammunition to start
 training. My office has some discretionary funds we can use to fund the
 start-up. Robert here has had a brilliant idea of how we might tap off 
some of the cash the state budget receives from the off-shore oil 
revenues for the future, and we'll explore that. But it strikes me that 
we'll need a place to train, someplace out-of-the-way. Any ideas, 
gentlemen?"<br><br>Jack Durer spoke first.<br><br>"Sir, there's an old 
rock quarry over in Bibb County which is just about perfect. Limited 
access, way, way out in the boonies. The state seized it for back taxes 
after the company that ran it went belly up, so we own it. We offered it
 back out on the market for sale, but nobody's even sniffed at the 
place. It's huge, with plenty of trainin' area, if you don't mind rocks.
 Plenty of space for a thousand meter rifle range. And any wayward shots
 are not goin' to escape the high walls and land on some poor innocent 
farmer's wife hangin' out the laundry. Some of the buildings are still 
standin', though they'll have to be re-plumbed and rewired, maybe some 
roof work done. It's served by a railroad spur that's still in good 
shape. It's also located more or less centrally in the state and that's a
 consideration since these trainees will be unpaid volunteers comin' 
from all over."<br><br>"What about housing for the trainees?" asked the AG, "is there enough room in the buildings for them?"<br><br>Jack began, "No . . "<br><br>"Tents,"
 General Wilson interjected. "We'll put 'em in tents. That's one thing I
 happen to know that the Adjutant General's office can lay its hands on 
in abundance. Tents, GP, Small, Medium and Large. Tents, sir, and 
folding cots, USGI. Of course if there is no place with soil in the 
bottom of that quarry, then we'll have to use special tent pegs suitable
 for rock. It'll be more expensive, but they'll have the advantage of 
not being pulled out in a high wind, or by an atomic blast come to 
that."<br><br>"I don't think the administration is that mad at us, YET," observed the Governor dryly.<br><br>"What about feeding the volunteers while they're there?" asked the AG.<br><br>"Jack,"
 asked Hal Wilson, "is there a building there that could serve as a food
 preparation facility? Not a big chow hall, but just a kitchen area with
 water and electricity."<br><br>"Yeah, there is, " responded Durer. "It 
was the old employee lunch room. Of course it's been stripped of the 
wiring and the plumbing, but it'll serve once repaired. You can put the 
trainees outside under tarps, I guess."<br><br>"Jack, I've lived most of my life under flapping green canvas and look what it's done for me," replied Hal Wilson with a smile.<br><br>The
 Governor once again took control. "So, we have a place. General, have 
you given any thought to the training schedule? The cadre you'll need?"<br><br>"Yes,
 sir," replied Wilson. "After Jack and I first spoke, I roughed out a 
training plan. I don't care how many of these trainees think they can 
shoot, I'd be surprised if one in ten really know how. So we start by 
getting their attention, then re-teaching them the basics. First show 
'em how on the 25 meter AQT and then have them apply that to shooting at
 distances. The ones who show aptitude will be brought back for another 
rotation of advanced marksmanship training. Time is of the essence, so I
 propose to start out big and get bigger after we prove the concept. 
We'll start with a group of 500 and make basic riflemen of them in one 
week. It's a tall order, but I believe with the right instructor cadre 
we can get it done."<br><br>"And who would that cadre be and where would you get them?" asked the Governor.<br><br>"Sir,
 Alabama is chock full of ex-Marines. I'll start with a friend of mine 
who's forgotten more about marksmanship instruction than I'll ever 
know."<br><br>Jack Durer asked, "Old War Horse?"<br><br>"Right," replied Wilson.<br><br>"Old War Horse?" asked the Governor.<br><br>"Yes,
 sir. Gunnery Sergeant Oliver Wendell Holmes Hafnir, USMC, Retired. They
 call him Old War Horse. Just about every Marine has a nickname, 
Governor, and those who don't aren't worth knowing. Hafnir is worth 
knowing. Plus, he has all sorts of retired Marines for friends who he 
can tap as subordinates. Men who know the subject almost as well as he 
does. Men he trusts from having served with them over thirty years.<br><br>I
 mentioned to him that I might have a chance to train some new recruits 
in the art of the M14 rifle and that he might, just might, have a chance
 to help out. He smiled so broadly I thought his weather-beaten face was
 going to crack. I couldn't keep him out of this deal now if I tried. 
He's the perfect man for the job. Of course, Hafnir and his cadre will 
not do this for free, sir. They'll expect to paid for it. We can hire 
them as state employees, sir, or treat them as independent contractors."<br><br>"Talk with Gunnery Sergeant Hafnir and sound him out on which alternative he would prefer, would you General?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"As soon as possible."<br><br>"Yes, sir. I'll sound him out right after I leave this meeting."<br><br>"Face-to-face, General, no phones or email."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"All
 right, General. Let's proceed to discuss how we deal with the National 
Guard and the threat of federalization. I understand both you and Jack 
have some ideas on how we might frame the question to the detriment of 
the National Command Authority."<br><br>Yes, sir, we do."<br><br>"Governor," the AG interrupted, "before we move on, I have to ask General Wilson one question."<br><br>Harold Allen Wilson turned to face the AG, "Yes, Attorney General Williams?"<br><br>"What's your nickname, General Wilson?"<br><br>"Mine, sir?"<br><br>"Yes, General, yours. What do they call you behind your back?"<br><br>"'Hard Ass', sir."<br><br>Jack Durer and Billy Mitchell both snickered.<br><br>The Governor tried to hide his smile with a hand, but failed.<br><br>"Well,
 General," the Governor said, "I'm told they call me 'Preacher Marsh' 
and the AG here is called my 'Deacon Williams.' There is substantial 
truth in a nickname, I fear. However, in the present emergency, a "hard 
ass" as Adjutant General is exactly what I need. Now, let's talk about 
how you're going to deal with the National Guard problem during the next
 90 days when you'll be using General Baxter as a ventriloquist's hand 
puppet to carry out my orders."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br>________________________________________<br><br>General
 Wilson had already left to pay a call on ex-Gunnery Sergeant Hafnir, 
and the rest of the meeting was just about wrapped up. Apart unforeseen 
problems, The Quarry would be open for business in two to three weeks. 
Jack Durer, however, had one more topic to discuss.<br><br>"Governor, 
there is one other concern that Billy and I have and that revolves 
around our dear political friend, the Lieutenant Governor."<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Sir,
 as you know he's as crooked as a dog's hind leg and we can make that 
case in court any time you want. The problem is that if we take him out 
of the equation now, maybe the administration will start to look at 
other, worse options more closely. We're playin' for time, and I 
understand that. Keepin' the Lieutenant Governor on the board helps that
 along, but . . ."<br><br>"But, what, Jack?"<br><br>"Sir, if you die, if
 you are assassinated, the Lieutenant Governor would come to power 
before we could cause trouble for him. Without you, the other side wins.
 Everything. We could not recover from your loss. And if I know that, 
someone on their side will see it, too."<br><br>"I see," said the 
Governor carefully, having already had some thoughts along these lines 
every night recently before prayers. "And your conclusion?"<br><br>"Sir,
 I don't have a conclusion. Not yet. How we handle the Lieutenant 
Governor is, sir, above my pay grade as they say. But I just wanted to 
say that we should beef up your security detail, is all. With men that 
we can trust. This could get very rough."<br><br>"All right," said Ray 
Marsh. "Billy, give me some suggestions on how you would do that and 
I'll see if I can live with it." He paused. "Gentlemen, this is all in 
God's Hands anyway."<br><br>"Yes, sir," they said together. The AG nodded his head in silence.<br><br>"Billy,
 get me that security plan. Jack, get The Quarry up and running. Robert,
 I'll see you tomorrow at the secure office to go over the Interposition
 strategy again." Then, he left the room, followed by his security 
detail.<br><br>Jack Durer shook his head. "It's all in God's Hands," he repeated.<br><br>"You know," said Robert Williams, Jr., "that reminds me of an old story my daddy used to tell me."<br><br>"What's that?" asked Billy Mitchell.<br><br>"Well,
 there was this A.M.E. preacher back around the turn of the last 
century, and he was always saying to the congregation, 'The Lord will 
provide! The Lord will provide!' It didn't matter what the problem was, 
the preacher's answer was always, 'the Lord will provide!' Well, one 
night after services, the preacher decided to go home through the 
thickest part of the woods, instead of following the road, even though 
he'd been warned that there was a big, ornery bear in there. But he was 
in a hurry to get home to his wife's blueberry pie, so he cut through 
the woods anyway. Sure enough, he gets right in the thickest part, and 
this bear rears up and charges him. Well, my daddy said that the 
preacher didn't have time to run and there wasn't a suitable tree he 
could climb close by, so the preacher and the bear commence to going at 
each, the preacher swinging a big branch he found on the ground and the 
bear swinging his big bear claws. So the preacher fought what my daddy 
called 'a delaying action' all the way out to the other side. And the 
parishioners, they can hear this terrible ruckus and the preacher 
shouting out, 'the Lord will provide! The Lord will provide!' So 
somebody ran for a shotgun, just as the preacher and the bear burst from
 the woods. The gun went off and the bear turned and ran, leaving the 
preacher standing there, bloody from a hundred cuts and slashes, 
half-naked, his clothes torn to pieces and his dignity barely under 
cover. His chest is heaving and his eyes are rolling and some smart 
mouth says, 'What happened, preacher? Didn't the Lord provide?' And the 
preacher looks over at him and between gasps of breath, explains. 
'Brother Henry, the Lord provides ALL things, but I just discovered He 
AIN'T much good in a bear fight.'"<br><br>They all laughed.<br><br>"So, Brother Billy," Robert Williams, Jr. concluded, "make it a GOOD security plan, lest the federal bear gets us all."<br><br>"Right," said Billy Mitchell.<br><br>They
 left Jack Durer alone in his living room, with his thoughts. As he sat 
planning his next moves in the service of his state, he absently flipped
 the Fifth Special Forces Group coin over and over in his hand.<br><br>It read what it always had read - "<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">De Oppresso Liber</span><span style="font-size:100%;">."<br>_________________________________________<br><br></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Encrypted messages in the wind</span><br><br>To Jack from Kraut Mueller: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Heard
 about your Type 57s and the Governor's plan to reorganize the ASDF. 
Suggestion on the Type 57s -- they will be much more combat-effective if
 you install Sadlak tactical magazine releases and Smith Enterprises 
extended bolt stop/releases. Shaves seconds off reload time.</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>To Kraut Mueller from Jack Durer: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Thanks for the tip on the rock quarry. We're going to use it. Don't expect it it to be called 'Camp Mueller", though."</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>To Jack from Will Shipman: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Our
 friend is mending well. I must talk to you face to face about a bequest
 from my grandfather. Sorry, but details must wait. However, they ARE 
worth waiting for. </span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>To General Wilson from Jack Durer: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Glad
 you concur on the Type 57 modifications. It seems we will have to 
recreate an Alabama State Armory for weapons inspection and modification
 at the very least. I also have just been informed of another small but 
significant arms stash which will be transferred to state control 
shortly. It is one hell of a story, too. More later. Where shall we set 
up the arsenal and who will head it?</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From Governor Marsh to General Wilson: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Agree
 to your suggestion of hiring General Chen Chao-yeh as Director of the 
new Alabama State Defense Force Arsenal. His prior experience at Arsenal
 205 in Taiwan and his familiarity with all types of weapons, old and 
new, can only bode well. His English is excellent, which of course is a 
plus. Will the first batch of M14SA's for the training class be ready in
 time?</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From General Wilson to Jack Durer: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">After
 shipping us several hundred each of the Sadlak and SEI upgrade parts, 
both companies have now cut us off, claiming all future production has 
been purchased by the United States government. What now?</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From Jack Durer to General Wilson: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">My
 sources confirm we are being squeezed by the Feds on the M14SA upgrade 
parts. General Chen is having engineering drawings made of both parts as
 I write this and he has made tentative arrangements for their 
production. Alabama-made samples should begin arriving at the arsenal 
within 10 days.</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From Governor Marsh to Jack Durer: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Have
 gone over your inventory of the fabled Winston County boxcar. In a 
word, incredible. Obviously these weapons will be "seized" for state 
training use, but if the inventory were to become public it would be 
hard to explain to the public how we need Quad Fifties or 75mm 
recoilless rifles for "maintenance of public order." I don't want an 
"Antiaircraft Detachment" or an "Antitank Company" on the TO&amp;E of 
the ASDF. How about "Critical Area Security Detachments"?</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From General Chen Chao-yeh, Director, Alabama State Defense Force Arsenal, to Jack Durer: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">My
 friend, we have finished unboxing, cleaning and inspecting all of the 
ordnance from Winston County. It is just as pristine and serviceable as 
when it was produced in 1944-1945. The explosive ammunition boxes -- 
grenades, mortar, and recoilless rifle 75mm -- have been sequestered in 
safe underground bunkers and samples will be tested in the near future 
at The Quarry between training rotations, so as not to raise any 
eyebrows (even friendly ones). I will advise you of the precise date we 
select, because I know you will want to be there.</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From Jack Durer to Kraut Mueller: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Thanks
 for all your help in recruiting the first classes for the ASDF 
marksmanship school. You know that if you weren't so damn radioactive, 
I'd find a place for you on the state roster. As we agreed the last time
 we spoke, you may indeed have a role in producing "training munitions" 
for the ASDF. The Governor is not opposed in principle to the idea, 
although he is also very adamant about not tipping our hand at this 
stage. We will need to find several cutouts and some generic company to 
contract for your services, or perhaps, to just set you up independently
 and let you produce under license to us. There is still the subject of 
the FBI surveillance of you, but perhaps that will abate in the near 
future. Cross your fingers that we make the evening news on THAT one.</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From Jack Durer to Will Shipman: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Governor
 sends his best regards and thanks you for your family's gift to our 
state. As you are not nearly so "notorious" as our mutual friend Kraut, 
the Governor wonders if you would like to accept command of the 
Minuteman Battalion of the ASDF. This is envisioned as a "quick reaction
 force" for the state and would be assigned the best people and most 
capable equipment. It would mean coming on the state payroll, but as far
 as the Governor is concerned your DD-214 more than qualifies you for 
the position, even if you never made commissioned officer. We can give 
you a competent XO and S-3 (the S-3 I have in mind is a West Pointer, 
three tours of Iraq and sharp as the edge of a Randall combat knife) to 
bridge that experience gap. Speaking of combat knives, I also envision a
 job for our friend and am glad to hear that the doctor has cleared him 
to return to duty. We have new identity cards for him and a new name to 
boot. They are official of course. Hey, we're the state, we can do 
anything. PS: Ollie Hafnir says your man Jimmy Flynn aced both the basic
 and designated marksmanship courses. Old War Horse says he's a hell of a
 shot. Tell the boy 'well done' from me, and tell him I still might let 
him shoot my Thompson one day yet.</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From General Chen Chao-yeh to Jack Durer: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">Pursuant
 to your inquiry of last week I have canvassed my fellow expatriates and
 located thirteen men who fit your requirements. Most have served with 
the former Republic of China's Long-Range Amphibious Reconnaissance 
Commandos, including some who did insertions into the PRC. Two of them 
are experienced instructors of special warfare. Most of them understand 
or speak passable English. The two that do not are still the best at 
what they do, so I thought that competence in that area should trump any
 language concerns. They can work on their English, and I have so 
ordered it. You should also know that we have finished arsenal 
rebuilding on the Type 36 .45 caliber submachine guns (our version of 
your M3A1) as well as the M60 medium machine guns which came in with the
 Type 57 rifles. My compatriots are familiar with both types of weapon 
and are certainly able to instruct yours.</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>From Kraut Mueller to Jack Durer: </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">You
 may recall my friend Dr. Tim Goldstein of UAB from back when we were 
working on that certain state senator's corruption case. Tim has 
recently been contacted by a professor of the Technion in Israel who is 
seeking to relocate his family away from what appears to be the 
approaching battle of Armageddon with the Iranians. He has many 
connections in the Israeli armed forces and arms producing 
establishment. We need to help this guy, because he can certainly help 
us. Make time to go see Tim ASAP. It's important.</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><br>_________________________________________<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SOVtxijm1FI/AAAAAAAABJ8/UVWg72hw2HY/s1600-h/recoilless+rifle.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252725238254720082" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: pointer; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="19-the-quarry_files/recoillessrifle.jpg" border="0"></a><br></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">"RECKLESS"</span><br><br><br>"FIRE IN THE HOLE!

 recoilless rifle belched smoke and debris out the back, kicking up 
swirling clouds of rock dust. The observers, well to the side of the 
back blast, lost sight of the weapon and crew as the cloud billowed and 
eddied. The impact of the round a thousand meters downrange was 
anticlimactic by comparison. Unless, thought Jack Durer, you were down 
there getting shelled.<br><br>"Not a very stealthy weapon," observed Jack.<br><br>"No,"
 conceded General Chen Chao-yeh, "it is old, some would say obsolete, 
but at the moment it is the largest piece of anti-armor artillery the 
state of Alabama owns. And they are good for training gunners until we 
obtain something bigger."<br><br>"Something bigger?" asked General Wilson.<br><br>"What's on your mind, my friend?" asked Durer.<br><br>"Let us watch the rest of the demonstration and then I will tell you," said the General.<br><br>"FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE!"<br><br>"LOAD, ONE ROUND, WILLY PETER!"<br><br>"ROUND UP!"<br><br>"CLEAR!"<br><br>"FIRE WHEN READY!"<br><br>"FIRING!"<br><br>"BOOM!"<br><br>Later,
 as command party relaxed in the briefing room of the old quarry 
headquarters awaiting the next demonstration, General Chen explained.<br><br>"Gentlemen,
 the recoilless rifle you saw demonstrated today was a 1945 production 
M20 of 75mm caliber. The total weapon weighs about 115 pounds. Its 
maximum range is 7000 yards. In it's day it could defeat a T-34 tank. 
Today, it is a popgun and even light armor would turn its blast. As 
originally designed, it was to be a man-packed crew served weapon, 
mounted on an M1917A1 machine gun tripod. Later, it was realized that it
 could be very handily mounted on a Jeep. As the tanks grew bigger and 
more heavily armored as the Cold War progressed, the M20 recoilless 
rifle was up-sized to the 106mm M40A1. With greater capability came 
greater weight and the M40A1 rifle, mount, .50 caliber spotting rifle 
and sight weighed a total of 483 pounds."<br><br>"As you no doubt 
observed, the recoilless ammunition cartridge case is perforated. This 
permits expanding gases of ignited propellant powder to escape evenly 
into the enlarged reaction chamber. These gases exert equal pressure in 
all directions within the chamber. Pressure to the front against the 
sloping wall of the chamber equals the force to the rear against the 
closed portions of the breech. The remainder of the force exerted by the
 gases causes a conventional weapon to recoil. In a recoilless rifle, 
the remaining gases are permitted to escape to the rear through openings
 in the breech; therefore the rifle remains motionless when fired.<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SOVvSC79DuI/AAAAAAAABKM/wqKhLmNownA/s1600-h/Recoilless_Rifle.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252726896214216418" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: pointer; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="19-the-quarry_files/Recoilless_Rifle.png" border="0"></a><br>"You
 must remember, as obsolete and old-fashioned as this looks to our eyes 
today, what an elegant solution it was at the time to a problem that was
 centuries old. This is not a short-range rocket launcher or bazooka. 
This is a direct-fire artillery piece, with a maximum range in the M40A1
 of 8,400 yards. When I first saw one at officer's school in the 
Republic of China, I was amazed at American ingenuity. I still am. The 
last iteration of the recoilless rifle in American service was the 
M40A2. I am told there are still a number of these still in storage at 
Anniston Army Depot along with approximately a quarter million rounds of
 ammunition of all types, HEAT, HEP and anti-personnel "beehive" rounds 
loaded with flechettes.<br><br>"In the 1990s, BOFORS developed a 3A 
HEAT-T antitank round which defeat the reactive armor of modern tanks 
and have a 90% first round hit capability using the Canadian CLASS laser
 sight. The Israelis, I happen to know, developed an even better sight, 
doing away with the .50 caliber spotting rifle entirely. They have also 
developed a class of very hard-hitting, state of the art projectiles for
 the 106mm, including thermobaric warheads for smashing reinforced 
concrete positions.<br><br>"Of course, you Americans are so profligate 
with your resources, you discarded the simple and effective recoilless 
rifle entirely for Dragon, TOW, Javelin and Hellfire precision-guided 
munitions. You put a few M40s in reserve stocks and gave the rest away 
to many countries including the Republic of China and Israel. We small, 
poor nations appreciated your wastefulness and were happy to use your 
cast-offs."<br><br>"But General . . ." Hal Wilson began to interrupt. Chen Chao-yeh held up his hand to cut him off.<br><br>"Here
 is my point. The federal government, including their police and 
mercenary formations, have many, many armored vehicles at their 
disposal. Most of these are actually sitting right here in Alabama at 
Anniston Army Depot, which is the principal rebuild facility for the 
Strykers, Bradleys and even the Abrams tanks. It is not outside the 
realm of possibility that, should they decide to do so, they may use 
these to deliver an attack that we could not blunt because we lack all 
of the supporting weapons of a modern army. But with 106mm recoilless 
rifles mounted on jeeps, using the latest sight packages and 
state-of-the-art ammunition we could defend ourselves, how is it you put
 Jack, 'On the cheap?'"<br><br>"When I was in Israel eighteen months 
ago, they demonstrated their upgraded 106mm recoilless rifles, mounted 
on the latest version of their Sufa vehicle -- the name means Storm in 
Hebrew -- but the recoilless rifle jeep version is called Davidka, 
'little David'. They build them under license from Chrysler and are 
based on the Jeep Wrangler design. They are fabricated in the Automotive
 Industries Ltd. factory in upper Nazareth. I toured the factory on an 
official visit and while I was there they demonstrated the M240 106mm 
gun carrier version -- the 'Davidka.' General Wilson, have you ever 
fired an M40 recoilless rifle mounted on an American military jeep?"<br><br>"Yes, many times."<br><br>"And
 do you recall the principal drawback of that combination, other than 
the fact that unlike an armored vehicle the operators are out in the 
open?"<br><br>"Yes, you have to stop and lay the gun perpendicular to 
the axis of the vehicle. You cannot fire directly forward over the 
hood."<br><br>"Precisely. General. However, the M240 Davidka CAN fire 
its recoilless rifle over the hood. You now can point the vehicle at 
your target and approach it, firing as you go.<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SOVvwxbd8JI/AAAAAAAABKU/8F-3Cjv0zG4/s1600-h/recoilless-rifle-truck-vietnam.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252727424090501266" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: pointer; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="19-the-quarry_files/recoilless-rifle-truck-vietnam.jpg" border="0"></a>Of
 course it is far more accurate to stop before you fire, but I watched 
Israeli operators launch a four vehicle chevron attack on eight old 
captured tank hulls in hull defilade position and destroy every one with
 single shots to the turrets. They are very light cavalry, but they are 
very fast and they work magnificently. If they are 'little Davids,' they
 sling a very accurate and hard hitting stone. One more thing the 
Israelis told me. Their latest antitank ammunition for the 106mm rifle 
will penetrate the armor of an M1A2 Abrams. It is based on a Russian 
design that they stole, apparently. That is all I could learn."<br><br>"But where will we get the 106mm recoilless rifles? Taiwan?"<br><br>"Alas,
 no. It is far too late for that. The PRC has my former home by the 
throat. I regret not picking some up as I left, but it didn't occur to 
me. I can provide you with experienced operators but not the weapons 
themselves."<br><br>"Where, then? I can tell you that the Governor will not permit me to go to Anniston and seize those in storage there."<br><br>"Why,
 General, you may obtain them from another small democratic country 
recently abandoned by the current President of the United States to 
shift for itself -- Israel. Perhaps my friend Captain Durer would like 
to become the first Sufa dealer in the state of Alabama, with a sideline
 in unauthorized armaments importation?"<br><br>"You know," said Jack Durer, "I might just do that."<br><br>"By the way Jack," asked General Wilson, "do you recall what the nickname of recoilless rifles is?"<br><br>"No, I don't," said Durer.<br><br>"'Reckless rifles,'" said Hal Wilson. "Reckless."<br><br>"Well," said Durer, "I guess that fits."<br></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">"Whispering Death"</span><br></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The Quarry, later that afternoon . . .</span><br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SOVw9xFrhqI/AAAAAAAABKc/r4LZq-9YAnw/s1600-h/quad+50.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252728746849044130" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: pointer; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="19-the-quarry_files/quad50.jpg" border="0"></a>The weather was closing in and promised misery.<br><br>Bob Tennant didn't care.<br><br>He was like a kid with a new toy, and DAMN - what a toy!<br><br>What a job. I LOVE it.<br><br>He
 owed it all to Kraut Mueller, who provided him the introduction to Jack
 Durer, who in turn got him the interview with Generals Wilson and Chen.
 Then, presto, chango! No more machinist job working for morons who 
hadn't had a clue what that involved.<br><br>Oh, he still got to use his
 machinist's skills for General Chen, but he also got to reach back into
 the happiest days of his young life, when he was an Army ordnance man. 
Tennant had been one of the first employees of the new ASDF Arsenal, and
 he'd stripped down, inspected, and been able to play with weapons he'd 
only dreamed of. Working at the Arsenal was like wandering through a 
museum of weapons history of the past seventy years, and being able to 
shoot the displays. He was constantly amazed at how much Chen Chao-yeh 
knew about all of them.<br><br>Take this M-51 Quad Fifty. When they'd 
got her and her sister in -- and Bob Tennant didn't know where they'd 
got 'em except for some overheard scraps of conversation about "the 
mine" -- the World War II electricals were badly corroded. The rest of 
the units were in mint condition, but they were deader than Kelsey's 
nuts without electricals.<br><br>The General had him tear most of it out
 - solenoids, switches, wiring, the works - and sketched out on a piece 
of paper how they would rewire it, along with a bill of materials, some 
of it including manufacturers, specs and sometimes part numbers, all 
from memory! Pat McCracken, the electronics man at the arsenal, was 
astounded too. Skeptical when Bob had showed him the piece of paper, 
McCracken had quickly become a believer. Now McCracken stood to the 
rear, ready to repair anything that broke, not that anything would. But 
he, Bob Tennant, was in the gunner's seat in the armored tub, ready to 
deal death though four fifty caliber belt-fed barrels.<br><br>He 
elevated the guns to the maximum as a safety measure, and then tested 
the controls by swinging the piece through a full sweep and then back 
again. Stopping with the front of the Quad pointed downrange, he dropped
 the barrels and aligned the sights on the derelict panel van that had 
been towed into place fifteen hundred meters away.<br><br>I </span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic;font-size:100%;">love</span><span style="font-size:100%;"> it. Make ready to receive scrap metal, boys.<br><br>General Chen's voice crackled in ears. "Verify range to target."<br><br>Tennant
 shifted the index finger of his right hand, and hit the actuation 
switch of the ITT military-grade laser range finder, one of General 
Chen's modifications.<br><br>"One-Five-Zero-Four meters," he reported through his voice activated throat mic.<br><br>"Calculate ballistics and lay the piece," ordered Chen.<br><br>Shifting
 his finger once more, he hit the ballistics computer switch, which took
 the range, calculated the ballistics of the fifty caliber 
armor-piercing incendiary tracer rounds loaded in the big drums and 
showed an elevation on the display. Tennant raised the guns ever so 
slightly to match the data. Another display showed the actual elevation 
of the guns. The General had explained that this was the best they could
 do with the resources they had, although he had expressed the wistful 
yearning to slave the guns directly into a targeting computer so that 
all the gunner would have to do is put the electronic crosshairs on the 
target and depress the triggers.<br><br>"Ready," he reported.<br><br>"Prepare to fire top guns."<br><br>"Roger."<br><br>This was going to be good.<br><br>"Fire," ordered Chen.<br><br>He
 began with short bursts and could see through the optical sight that 
the van was beginning to shred. The noise was thunderous and he was 
grateful for the commo earmuffs.<br><br>Tracers sliced through the sheet
 metal a kilometer and a half away. He had been dead on without 
adjustment. Boy, some World War II antiaircraft artilleryman would have 
given his left nut for General Chen's electronics!<br><br>"Cease fire top guns, prepare to fire bottom guns."<br><br>"Roger. Ready."<br><br>"Fire."<br><br>Tennant
 let go with the bottom pair of fifties and he traversed 
infinitesimally, walking his fire toward the front of the panel van.<br><br>"Cease fire bottom guns. Prepare to fire all guns."<br><br>"Roger."<br><br>He took in a deep breath. "Ready."<br><br>Hold on to your dicks, boys.<br><br>"Fire all guns."<br><br>He
 depressed both triggers at once. By prearrangement with General Chen, 
he would fire a few bursts and then hammer down until empty.<br><br>The 
air roared, the world shook, and the shock and vibration caused him to 
drift off target. He brought it back with his last burst, then hammered 
down.<br><br>It went on and on. The van blew up and pieces of it were still hitting the ground when the roaring stopped abruptly.<br><br>Out. End of the show.<br><br>Shit, that was incredible. Load me up, thought Tennant, give me something else to kill.<br><br>What was the line he had read in that book about the building of the atomic bomb?<br><br>"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."<br><br>That's exactly how Bob Tennant felt at that moment. Bloodthirsty and atavistic.<br><br>God bless you, Kraut Mueller.<br><br>What a rush.<br><br>General Chen brought him back to reality. "Secure the piece, Tennant."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>Turning
 the master switch off, he pushed himself up out of the tub. The barrels
 smoked and sizzled with the falling drizzle. He stepped down and out 
amidst a welter of links and brass.<br><br>Jack Durer saw the look on his face. "Having a little fun, Tennant?"<br><br>"Hell, yes, sir! That's the most fun I ever had in OR out of bed!"<br><br>Durer and the rest of the spectators laughed.<br><br>"Thanks
 for the demonstration, Tennant," said Durer, "I haven't seen one of 
those work since Vietnam." He paused and then asked, "Do you know what 
the Viet Cong called Quad Fifties, Tennant?"<br><br>"No, sir, that was before my time."<br><br>"They called them "Whispering Death."<br><br>"Pretty loud whisper, sir," replied Tennant.<br><br>"I
 imagine they were talking about being on the receiving end, Bob. You 
don't hear the guns firing or even the ballistic cracks until the rounds
 are already in you. I saw a massed attack during Tet just dissolve when
 it got hit by one of those." Durer pointed over Tennant's shoulder. 
Durer closed his eyes briefly at the memory and suppressed the urge to 
shudder.<br><br>"Hard Ass" Wilson turned to General Chen. "That was 
impressive as hell, Chen, but we aren't going to be fighting human wave 
assaults, are we? Or defending our airfields from Messerschmitt 109s? Or
 F-22s?"<br><br>"Messerschmitts? F22s? No, General. But Blackhawks? 
Sikorskys? Perhaps. With Raufoss rounds, this is a very potent 
anti-helicopter weapon. Until we get more capable weapon systems, this 
is the only challenge we have to federal control of our airspace, no 
matter how pitiful it may seem when balanced against the threat."<br><br>The
 General grunted his reluctant agreement. "Yeah, that's kept me up 
nights too. All right, we'll modify the TO&amp;E of what the Governor 
wants us to call the 'Critical Area Security Detachment.' Have you any 
ideas about mounting them to a vehicle like the gun trucks of South 
Vietnam?"<br><br>"Yes, General, I do," replied Chen. "I think a two and 
half ton truck as your Army used in Southeast Asia is perhaps too big. 
We can do better, go smaller, faster, more nimble without losing 
stability as a gun platform. I have looked at your Humvee and that might
 work, if a bit cramped. I will have you a recommendation within 48 
hours."<br><br>"We'll have to recruit gunners and support crews 
discreetly. I don't want just everybody knowing about these. Then we'll 
have to train them discreetly, too." He pondered for a moment. "Once 
they're operational, I'll assign 'em to Shipman's Minuteman Battalion 
for now. Hell, they're his family's guns aren't they?"<br><br>"Yes, General," Jack Durer agreed. "They are."<br><br>"Well,
 if I understand that story correctly, his family stole them so as far 
as I'm concerned he can use them. Although I hope to God he doesn't have
 to."<br><br>"Indeed," murmured Chen Chao-yeh softly in Mandarin.<br><br>"Indeed."</span><p></p>

							<p>tjbbpgob sez: "Mike, just read your latest chapter online. I 
would like to know where are we going to get a gov. like that in Al."<br><br>Srangely
 enough, we already had one similar to that and his name was Fob James. 
 The words I put in the fictional Ray Marsh's mouth were spoken in large
 measure by Fob James to the FBI and US attorney's right after he took 
over as Governor.<br><br>Then he was refering to Waco and told them, 
according to someone I implicitly trust who was in the room.  "There 
ain't goin' to be no Wacos in my state and if you try I'll have the 
state police in between you and your intended victims.  And if I can't 
get them between you, I'll have them on your backs."  True story.  The 
feds, of course, were outraged.<br><br>You may remember that Fob took his oath beneath a banner upon which was printed the Tenth Amendment.<br><br>Unfortunately,
 Fob James turned out to be a man who unaccountably excelled at 
embracing his enemies and urinating upon his friends.  That plus his 
religiously, uh, eccentric, wife guaranteed that he was a one-termer.  
(She was famouly reported to have removed pictures of Jefferson Davis 
and Robert E. Lee from the Governor's Mansion because she believed they 
were possessed by the Devil.)<br><br>There are Ray Marshs and Robert Williams out there.  I pray they come to the fore when we need them.<br><br>Vanderboegh<br><br>III</p>

							<p>I'm enjoying this story, though I am a bit perplexed by the 
idea that any imaginable 106mm HEAT round could penetrate the frontal 
armor of any Western MBT currently in service.<br><br>Composite laminate
 armor, like the Chobham armor on Abrams and Challenger tanks, and now 
copied by everyone right down to the Chinese, was specifically created 
as a countermeasure against HEAT rounds and is highly, highly resistant 
to them, even before it gets a layer of reactive armor tiles bolted on.<br><br>There
 were, and maybe still are, 105mm HEAT rounds in inventory intended for 
M60 series and M1128 Stryker MGS vehicles.  They weren't worth a 
tinker's damn against the frontal armor of even mid-1980s Soviet tanks, 
and this was never secret.  Only depleted uranium sabot rounds had any 
chance against the frontal armor of a T64 or T72, let alone a T80.  The 
M1A2 is said to be much better protected than a T80.  And a 106mm 
recoilless rifle generates rather less impressive velocities than the 
105mm L68 tank gun.<br><br>The general lack of lethality of the 105mm L68 is the reason it was replaced in NATO with the 120mm L44.<br><br>A
 lot of very impressive work has been done with explosively formed 
penetrators in the last twenty years, and this method does lend itself 
to use in tank main gun rounds and recoilless rifle rounds (though it is
 perhaps better suited to mines and rockets).  My SWAG is that a 120mm 
EFP round would still be pretty marginal against the frontal armor of an
 M1A2 and a 105mm/106mm version would be even more questionable.<br><br>On
 the other hand I would expect a 75mm recoilless rifle HEAT round, even 
of WWII design and construction (and there have been great leaps forward
 in the design and manufacture of such things in the past sixty years), 
to be able to kill Bradleys, Strykers, and M113s quite authoritatively 
from any angle.  Only against MBTs would it be likely to be found 
lacking.<br><br>And I would expect manportable SAMs like the old Redeye,
 or SA7, or a newer design if available, to be the only thing that could
 be of any use at all against fixed wing CAS for the sort of force you 
describe.  I claim no expertise in such matters but I would not expect 
it to be practical to make such things in a garage workshop, however.</p>

							<p>"I claim no expertise in such matters but I would not expect

 If one reads the history of the early days of our own revolution, you 
are struck by how thin a margin we prevailed and how other powers and 
forces, acting for their own selfish reasons (sometimes unintentionally)
 made it possible.  Take the Dutch traders of St. Eustatious, for 
example.  Without their smuggled gunpowder early on, the revolution 
would have failed.  Absolved takes the template of our Revolution and 
lays over present day realities.<br><br>Insofar as any HEAT projectile 
defeating the improved Chobham armor of the Abrams, I can only say that 
Abrams have been knocked out by new Russian warheads on RPGs in Iraq.  
The precise way this is done is not known to me.  The Israelis ARE said 
to have produced prototype copies of it.<br><br>I do thank you for your 
analysis.  Such feedback helps keep a factional scribbler such as me 
honest.  Don't leave your wallet laying around, though.<br><br>;-)<br><br>Mike Vanderboegh<br><br>III</p>

							<p>Great story. Looking forward to eventually buying the book.<br>Regarding
 the stopping of armor, there was a long thread on usenet about that 
very subject, long around 1994 or so. The subject was 'Tanks in 
cityscapes: can you say targets?'.<br>It ran to over 300 posts, some by 
people who purported to be knowledgeable. I mention this as a point of 
information, purely from a reinventing the wheel standpoint. It's still 
accessible online, at least for now. <br>Also, as far as DIY projects go, <br>http://www.aardvark.co.nz/pjet/<br>is
 a site maintained by a New Zealander who was researching an off the 
shelf pulse jet powered cruise missile, until he got shut down by his 
govt. <br>This is most likely a pipe dream(pun intended), but again, it's for informational purposes. <br><br>Keep writing and stay safe.</p>

							<p><i>I wonder, how it is that someone can extrapolate so far from so little evidence without a preconceived agenda?</i><br><br>I
 have an agenda: all governments are morally invalid.  Before the last 
two chapters your book supported this agenda.  But now you are 
glorifying the government of Alabama, and the effect is of Charlie Brown
 thinking that just this time, he will get to kick the football.<br><br><i>Have you read ANY of the preceding chapters?  Do you understand the context?</i><br><br>I've
 read all of the chapters, and very much liked them except for the last 
two.  The point of the song 'Poor White Boys' is that the political 
power of the Confederacy was as illegitimate as that of any other 
government, and the rulers were as crooked as any other government.  I 
believe you've said elsewhere that Absolved is a deliberate echo of the 
US' historical events.  If so, then after the rebels win they should 
defeat the militia while it is defending the people, just like George 
Washington did.  'Meet the new boss -- same as the old boss' is a 
historically honest description of government.<br><br><i> It is also 
plain from the narrative that Ray Marsh, the Governor, would be 
forbidden by his principles to seize power for himself. He sees himself 
as a steward of the people, and a humble servant of God's purpose not 
his own, and actually asks God to take this cup from his lips.</i><br><br>He
 has already seized power -- he is ruling as governor, isn't he?  His 
legitimacy is supplied by the same old 'election' fig leaf as the 
federals', and the next officeholder is unlikely to be as scrupulous.<br><br>The
 story I would rather read would paint the governor as a typical 
politician blown in the federal winds, rather than the historically rare
 king who sees themselves as steward.  The heroes of the story should be
 avoiding the grasp of all politicians, and taking their freedom back 
from everybody that wants to infringe on it.</p>

 here's a challenge as a writer!  Don't retract any of the published 
material.  Keep the governor and the new state standing army that sees 
him as valid.  Keep all their personalities and stated motivations, and 
much of their plotline for the next year.  That satisfies readers who 
can't imagine themselves as anything but serfs, and whose goal with 
politics is to find a better quality of king to rule them.<br><br>Invent
 a new group of techies and entrepreneurs that thinks the federal and 
Alabama governments are equally invalid and inconvenient, and both a 
parasitic distraction from their life goals.  The sort of people who, 
when they make an FAE out of an airplane, fly it remotely with radio 
control model airplane parts rather than a live suicide pilot.  People 
who would fit into Victor Koman's <i>Kings of the High Frontier</i>, <a>http://www.pulpless.com/king.html</a>.
  In real life, the smallish private company SpaceX has flown their 
vehicle, and intends to do manned missions next year, so you'll have to 
write boldly to avoid being overtaken by reality.  Imagine the techies 
have home built little remote controlled cat-sized lizard-shaped robots 
which climb walls and trees and crawl into buildings to bug them or set 
them on fire.  Imagine they can build and manage hundreds of these 
things, which are limited by battery life to two hours of movement or 
two weeks of monitoring.  Imagine they're not attempting to fight the 
last war.<br><br>How do these groups interact?</p>

							<p>Just one problem, any vessel arriving from overseas is 
inspected by Customs and Border Protection.  How did they get a shipload
 of guns past them.  CBP can also legally seize any imported item not 
inspected upon arrival.  Not to mention that firearms importation is 
strictly regulated.  Just having the state seize them does not make they
 seizable by the feds.</p>
