 Quintard was fishing down on the dock behind the house on Smith Lake 
when the Suburban turned up the road. It wasn't much of a road, but then
 it wasn't much of a house. It was just a cabin really -- a kitchen, a 
bathroom (both of which took their water from the spring up the bluff) 
and the great room where Charlie had lived alone and slept alone these 
past five and a half years.<br><br>Quintard was humming "Simple Man" by 
the Charlie Daniels Band softly so as not to startle the fish. Beside 
him, his coon dog Push (short for Pushmataha) raised his head and 
growled.<br><br>"Quiet," ordered Charlie, "I'm fishin' here."<br><br>Push quit growling but stared up the hill in the direction of the cabin. Car doors slammed in the distance.<br><br>Charlie sighed to himself, "Here we go again."<br><br>He
 knew who it was. Nobody came to Charlie's place, not even by accident. 
You had to WANT to find this place to get here, which was why Charlie 
liked it. In all the time he'd lived here, he'd never been visited by 
somebody he didn't know or hadn't invited, except once.<br><br>Until last week.<br><br>And now.<br><br>Putting his pole in the fixture on the dock, Charlie Quintard stood up, Push rising beside him.<br><br>"No," commanded Charlie, "Guard."<br><br>Push halted. The dog permitted himself a short whine to indicate his protest.<br><br>"Stay. Guard," repeated Charlie.<br><br>His
 rod and fish bucket would be safe from all predators now and so would 
Push. The last bunch had been trigger happy and when they came up on 
Push unexpectedly they'd shot at him and missed. If they'd been better 
marksmen, well, Charlie didn't want to think on that. Phil always said 
they were big dog killers.<br><br>"Hello the house!" Charlie heard one 
of them shout. Well at least this bunch was more polite than the last. 
They'd just kicked in his door while he watched from the bluff above, 
and made a terrible mess of the place. Even stole one of his knives. One
 of them later told Charlie that they thought nobody was home because 
they didn't see a car. Maybe this bunch had spotted the wisp of smoke 
coming out of his chimney, remnants of his breakfast fire in the cast 
iron stove in the kitchen.<br><br>"Hello the house!" came the call again, louder.<br><br>"Hello yourself," Charlie replied amiably as he rounded the corner.<br><br>Four
 men in body armor and load bearing vests stood in front of the 
Suburban, spread out, weapons held at the ready. Two more stood behind 
the open front doors of the SUV, rifles pointed toward the cabin, ready 
to give covering fire if needed. All pivoted their weapons to point at 
Charlie.<br><br>Huh, six of them this time, Charlie noted silently, and 
better armed too. They were nervous though, Quintard could tell. Charlie
 kept his hands where they could see them.<br><br>"How can I help you fellers?" Charlie asked.<br><br>His
 voice was calm, steady, even friendly. Good, thought Charlie. I shoulda
 been an actor. He smiled inwardly to match the one on his face. He 
could see the agents were unimpressed.<br><br>"Is this Phil Gordon's place? one demanded.<br><br>"Yup,
 he owns it, but I've been renting it now fer 'bout near six years now. I
 pay him a year's rent in advance every June with my tax refund. I sorta
 watch the place fer him. Before I moved in, he found a buncha squatters
 running a meth lab in it. Been in his family fer years."<br><br>"Well,"
 said one of the agents (his last name was Allen) with a malicious grin,
 "you'll have to find another place to live, Bubba. This place belongs 
to the U.S. government now."<br><br>"Name's Charlie."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"My name's Charlie, not Bubba. Charlie Quintard."<br><br>"You got any guns, Charlie?" demanded the first one, who was apparently the leader.<br><br>"Does it look like I do?" letting a slight exasperation bleed into his still-friendly voice.<br><br>"I mean in the house," the leader clarified.<br><br>"Naw. Don't own one. Don't need 'em."<br><br>"Any of Phil's hidden around the place?"<br><br>"Not that he ever tole me."<br><br>"You mind if we look?"<br><br>It wasn't a question nor the least bit friendly.<br><br>"Naw, go right ahead. Them other fellers you sent did too and they didn't find nothin'."<br><br>All
 six agents came instantly alert. If Charlie's amiable conversation had 
taken the edge off some of their wariness, it was gone now.<br><br>"They were here?" the leader demanded.<br><br>"Shore,
 just like y'all but dressed in their shiny go-to-meetin' suits. One of 
'em, said his name was Henderson, came up to nail some legal notice on 
the door. Said Mr. Gordon was a cop killer and he was dead and I was 
E-victed."<br><br>"Where'd they go?" demanded the leader.<br><br>"How'd I
 know? They drove off in a truck just like that," said Charlie pointing 
at the Suburban. "They got excited when I tole them 'bout Phil's other 
place and they went off lookin' for it. Reckon they found it, 'cause I 
ain't seen 'em since."<br><br>"What other place?"<br><br>"The one at 
Dead Man's Hollow (only Charlie pronounced it 'Holler'). Phil's family 
had a homestead there more than a hundred an' eighty years ago."<br><br>The
 first team's Suburban had been found parked neatly behind the Winston 
County Sheriff's Office in Double Springs. No one had a clue how it had 
gotten there. The four man team had vanished. It should be noted for the
 record that no one thought they were on an unannounced vacation in 
Vegas. And the local LEOs, as was usual these days, were uncooperative. 
How much of the Sheriff Department's mystification was real and how much
 was an act was the subject of great debate at the ATF office in 
Birmingham, where both teams had come from.<br><br>The team leader was unimpressed with Charlie's history lesson and started issuing orders.<br><br>"Allen,
 keep an eye on him. Chambliss and Duncan, search the house. You two," 
indicating the men behind the doors, "stay here and cover us."<br><br>"Hey,
 wait," protested Charlie, "My dog is down by the dock. Can I call him 
up? That last bunch shot at him, but he wouldn't hurt a fly."<br><br>The leader, whose name was Carmichael, hesitated. Finally, he nodded his assent.<br><br>Charlie
 yelled, "Push! Come here boy!" and then added as the agents moved 
toward the cabin, "You don't have to kick in the door like them last 
fellers. It's unlocked."<br><br>They kicked it in anyway.<br><br>Push 
loped up the hill in easy strides and came to rest at Charlie's feet. 
Quintard bent down and welcomed his only close friend, scratching him 
behind the ears and praising him.<br><br>"Good boy. Well done."<br><br>This
 was actually working out better than the first time, Charlie thought. 
Maybe nobody gets shot at today. Maybe, he prayed, nobody dies. He began
 humming "Simple Man" again, as the agents tore apart his cabin.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Now I'm the kind of man who wouldn't harm a mouse,<br>But if I catch somebody breakin' in my house,<br>I've got a twelve gauge shotgun waitin' on the other side.<br>So don't go pushin' me against my will<br>I don't want to fight you but I durn sure will,<br>So if you don't want trouble you'd better just pass me on by.</span><br><br><br>Charlie
 was a simple man and led a simple, spartan existence. There was no 
phone in the cabin, no radio or TV so there was no cable. Nor was there a
 computer, electric heaters, lamps or toasters. Charlie Quintard lived 
off the grid.<br><br>He had once been an IT specialist for HealthSouth 
down in Birmingham, but the hours were crazy, the pressure intense and 
the supervision positively anal. Still he was doing pretty well for a 
Winston County boy whose daddy had been a coal miner when he managed to 
get himself fired. His boss had discovered one morning that, buried in 
the detail of a historic painting of the <a href="http://www.canerossi.us/ftmims/massacre.htm">Massacre at Fort Mims</a> that Charlie used as a screen saver, there were two faces which he had modified from the original.<br><br>One was Charlie's, superimposed on the body of a Creek brave, knife in the air.<br><br>The
 other was that of Richard Scrushy, the universally feared and despised 
CEO of HealthSouth, which had been electronically pasted onto the body 
of a white settler about to be scalped.<br><br>When Charlie lost his 
job, he lost his wife, his house and his taste for the outside world. 
Quintard retreated into the Bankhead National Forest of his youth, 
trying to get his head straight. He'd chanced across Phil Gordon, a 
boyhood friend of his daddy, in a convenience store in Addison one day, 
shortly after Phil's encounter with the meth lab.<br><br>There was an 
identity of interest. Phil needed a house sitter and Charlie needed 
shelter in a place away from the world. Now, more than five years later,
 Charlie still enjoyed the solitude and Richard Scrushy, his humorless 
ex-boss was doing time in the federal slammer for corporate misdeeds, 
thus proving to Charlie Quintard the existence of a just God. The fact 
that Charlie's annual rent was merely one dollar was none of the ATF's 
business.<br><br>But because Charlie was a simple man, the search, if 
the clumsy tossing of his personal effects to no purpose could be called
 a search, didn't take long.<br><br>Charlie had told them the truth. 
There were no firearms on the place. They did find his personal hunting 
knife and a half-dozen others in various stages of manufacture. They 
found his traditional bow and a quiver full of flint-tipped arrows. They
 tipped over his flint napping table and scattered his flints and tools 
across the greatroom floor. They found his tomahawk, emblazoned with the
 signs of his clan and tribe, for Charlie Quintard was three-quarter 
Cherokee.<br><br>They found, and threw to the floor, his many books on 
the early history of Alabama, Indian lore and primitive weapons and 
survival skills. They searched though his bulk foods that he kept in 5 
gallon plastic pails, ruining some of it and spilling more. And then 
they found his medicine bag.<br><br>It hadn't occurred to Charlie that 
the feds would mess with his sacred artifact, so when he saw Duncan come
 out with the ornately beaded bag in his outstretched hand, he startled.<br><br>"Hey boss," yelled Duncan, "Look at this."<br><br>"What's in it?" asked Carmichael.<br><br>"NO!" Charlie yelled and started for the porch. "That's my medicine bag! You CAN'T!"<br><br>"What
 kind of medicine? Pot?" asked Duncan as he dumped the contents out onto
 a table that stood on the porch to the right of the door. It looked 
like junk to the agent -- a feather, a rock, some sticks and . . . 
something Duncan had never seen before.<br><br>It was an ancient panther
 claw. Charlie had found it when wandering in the Sipsey Wilderness. The
 Alabama black panther had been believed to be extinct after about 1920 
or so, but their banshee cries at night had been recently heard again by
 more than one Winston Countian, including Charlie.<br><br>The claw was 
powerful medicine and though Charlie's forward motion was stopped by the
 muzzle of Allen's M-4, Push was not deterred.<br><br>In a blur he 
closed the distance between him and Duncan, flying up the steps and into
 the air, going for Duncan's throat. Duncan stood as if rooted to the 
spot. Allen never wavered from covering Charlie.<br><br>Chambliss was 
inside and the two riflemen at the Suburban didn't have a clean shot. 
That left Carmichael, who was standing off to the side. As the dog 
leaped, he presented a full profile to the senior agent. Still, if he 
hadn't had his hand on his pistol he'd never have cleared leather. But 
he did, and he shot Pushmataha on the way by, hitting him with two of 
four shots. The lifeless dog hit Duncan squarely and knocked him ass 
over tit back into the doorway.<br><br>"NO!" screamed Charlie again. But
 even in his agony he did not lose his presence of mind. Allen still had
 him covered and seemed even more eager now to kill him than before. For
 one thing, the agent was smiling.<br><br>Oh, yeah, thought Charlie, you've done this thing before, haven't you, you bastard? You LIKE it.<br><br>For
 his part, Allen was disappointed. By now, the agent figured, this 
hillbilly schmuck should have given him reason to blow his head off. 
This guy was either too smart, too stupid or too scared to do anything, 
and Allen tended to believe the last two rather than the first. Living 
this far out in the woods without a gun? That was just plain stupid. 
Yeah, sneered the agent to himself, Forrest Gump here was just a scared 
sheep like so many he'd seen over the years.<br><br>Used to be, Allen 
thought of himself as a sheepdog like most cops did. Not any more. It 
was a different world now. And after he helped pick up the bodies on 
Sipsey Street, Allen decided he would tell himself no more lies.<br><br>If
 being a wolf was what it took to survive, then he would be a wolf. One 
of the reasons he liked working for Carmichael was that the supervisory 
agent had made the same choice.<br><br>Allen knew that the only reason 
Carmichael had let the hick call his dog up was so they could set up a 
plausible incident and kill them both. The way Carmichael was looking at
 him now, Allen realized he had screwed up. The senior agent was pissed 
that Allen hadn't taken his opportunity. Excuses could be manufactured 
later, and who would say different?<br><br>Allen caught Carmichael's 
attention with an arched eyebrow and slight uptick of his muzzle toward 
Charlie. The senior agent shook his head imperceptibly. You missed your 
chance, wait for the next one.<br><br>"Go get your dog, asshole," Allen told Charlie.<br><br>Charlie
 shuffled like a zombie up to the steps, pulling himself up the rail by 
what seemed to be superhuman effort. With a sob, he dropped to his knees
 beside the coon dog, cradling it in his arms and rocking back and forth
 slightly. He was crying.<br><br>Yeah, thought Allen disdainfully, just a
 sheep. Now, if Carmichael has this prick figured right, he's going to 
go inside and either suck up his pitiful guts and come at us out the 
front with his worthless prehistoric weapons, or he will try to boogie 
out the back for the river. Allen had him figured for the back but he 
didn't intend to kill him right away. They still needed to find out 
where this dead man's whatever place was. Gotta give him some rope to 
hang himself though. Make him think he's got a chance. Yeah, Allen saw, 
Carmichael had it figured that way too.<br><br>Charlie rose with 
Pushmataha and entered the cabin. At a gesture from Carmichael, Duncan 
and Chambliss came out of the cabin and down the steps, moving to the 
right and clearing the field of fire for the shooters at the Suburban. 
Turning, they now formed a perfect L-shaped ambush. Allen knew he was 
the plug in the drain.<br><br>As Allen ambled down toward the side of 
the cabin, Chambliss took a last glance in the door. "He's just kneeling
 by the bed," he told the others.<br><br>Allen hoped he was right and 
the Indian lost his nerve and ran out the back. If one of them had to go
 back into the cabin, they'd be within knife range. Of course they could
 Waco the place and burn it down. But the moron didn't even have a 
single barrel twelve to give them an excuse, and nobody but a Buddhist 
monk committed suicide by burning themselves to death, no matter what 
Janet Reno said. Besides, the only gasoline on the place was in the 
Suburban's tank. He hadn't even seen so much as a kerosene lantern.<br><br>So
 let him run out the back, Allen decided. He moved along in no 
particular hurry. If the rube bolted toward the lake, Allen had a good 
clean shot for at least 75 yards. Keeping close to the structure to 
avoid being seen from the side windows, the agent came around the 
chimney headed for the back corner of the cabin.<br><br>This was going to be easy.<br><br>Charlie
 Quintard waited, nestled into the back angle of the chimney. He had to 
do this quietly. He couldn't brain him with his tomahawk and he couldn't
 just slit the agent's throat. Contrary to the movies, both of those 
means of taking out a sentry were audible for some distance. If he tried
 either, Charlie would be heard in the front.<br><br>When Allen was at a
 45 degree angle to his front and left, Charlie seized the agent's head 
and pulled it to the left as he brought the knife HARD through the back 
of his neck and into the medulla oblongata. He violently moved the knife
 back and forth, "scrambling his eggs" as someone once said. The result 
was instant and virtually silent incapacitation. Allen didn't have time 
to do anything but twitch, and die. Charlie removed his knife and 
lowered Allen's body to the ground, half turning him as he did so so he 
could reach the agent's face. He then took a second or two to silently 
carve up ATF Special Agent Hank Allen's face with horizontal and lateral
 strokes of the knife and to separate his nose and ears from his head. 
The agent's dead eyes were still wide in surprise when Charlie Quintard 
moved quietly away from him, angling away from the cabin toward the 
river and the nearest brush.<br><br>He was deep into the trees when the first horrified shouts heralded the discovery of Allen's body.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Well, you know what's wrong with the world today?<br>People done gone and put their Bibles away.<br>They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land.<br><br>Well the Good Book says, and I know its the truth,<br>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.<br>You'd better watch where you go<br>And remember where you've been.<br>That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man.</span><br><br>Carmichael was scared and angry. God, was there NOTHING simple about this Gordon case?<br><br>It
 was obvious now what had happened to the first team. This bastard's act
 had conned them all, including him. But there was no way he was going 
to chase this guy, this Indian, this WARRIOR, into the brush on his own 
home turf with just four other guys. We'd be picked off one by one. And 
Carmichael, sheepdog turned wolf or not, intended to live to collect his
 pension. Or at least, he reflected, to escape to a non-extradition 
country if we don't win what is rapidly turning into a civil war.<br><br>Carmichael
 tried his cell phone again. No signal. They'd lost radio contact when 
they came down off the mountain to the lake. Besides, there was all 
kinds of interference these days. The smart boys in DC said it was 
deliberate jamming by radio operators and commo hackers who were 
sympathetic to killer gun nuts like Gordon. And only tactical teams had 
the good satellite phones. This was supposed to be a milk run.<br><br>Shit.<br><br>And now there was this "Dead Man's Hollow." Was that where the Indian was headed?<br><br>Would they find the dead from the first team there?<br><br>Did it even exist?<br><br>Was it all a lie?<br><br>Carmichael decided.<br><br>"Back to the Suburban," he ordered. "We'll come back with more people. Leave Allen. We'll get him when we come back."<br><br>The
 other agents sagged in relief. The last thing they wanted to do was 
handle that bloody corpse. Allen's mutilation had shocked them in a way 
that even those among them who had been combat veterans in another life 
couldn't get their minds around.<br><br>This was <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">AMERICA</span>. We're the <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</span>. This isn't supposed to happen to one of <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">US</span>.<br><br>Of
 course, this was exactly the effect Charlie Quintard had in mind when 
he did it. Scared men, jumpy men, make mistakes. And at five to one, 
Charlie needed all the help he could make for himself.<br><br>Chambliss 
had policed up Allen's weapons. Funny thing about that, Carmichael 
thought, the Indian had left the dead agent's M-4 and pistol. Didn't he 
know how to use them?<br><br>As Charlie ran through the woods, he was 
making a mental inventory of his options and an evaluation of his enemy 
much like Carmichael. Quintard had his knife, his 'hawk, his primitive 
bow and a quiver which held a dozen flint-tipped arrows. He stopped 
briefly to string his bow, then he was off again at a lope, circling 
around to the road the Suburban had come in on. It wasn't that he didn't
 know how to use firearms. It was just that he was BETTER with the 
weapons he carried. He'd been living with them, and by them, for more 
than five years now. When you eat only as well as you can hunt, you get 
good at it. That's what made his skill at the bow.<br><br>As for the 
knife and the 'hawk, he was also good in close with them. The only 
social occasions he attended away from his cabin were centered around 
edged weapons and primitive close combat skills. He sold the knives he 
made and the flint arrowheads he napped to other primitive hunters and 
frontier re-enactors. For the past five years his life had worked like 
this.<br><br>Every so often he'd hike out to the main road and thumb a 
ride into the Double Springs Post Office. Once there, he'd pick up his 
mail, cash his postal money orders, and mail off the products of his 
labor to a growing customer base. After that, he'd go down to the 
library to scan the newspapers and magazines. Jill Shipman, the 
librarian, had taken Charlie under her wing sometime before and she let 
him buy new books on the library discount card and would always save any
 discards she thought he might like, selling them to him for a quarter 
apiece. After the library, Charlie would head to the Piggly Wiggly (he 
hated and shunned WalMart) and pick up items for his larder. Every now 
and then, he would go to the Ace Hardware for a tool, or some nails. 
When he was done, he'd hire the Piggly Wiggly stock boy to drive him 
back home with his plunder in the stock boy's pickup.<br><br>Ten or 
twelve times a year, a buddy would come by to pick him up and together 
they'd go to a mountain man rendezvous or a re-enactment like Fort Mims 
way down state near Mobile. They'd camp rough and compete in edged 
weapons contests -- with wooden knives and 'hawks in hand-to-hand 
matches, and with cold steel in throws for accuracy. Throwing or 
hand-to-hand, there were few better than Charlie Quintard.<br><br>Charlie
 had never joined the army. Those few who knew him thought that was 
probably a good thing. Putting up with the Army's idea of discipline was
 not in Charlie Quintard's internal makeup. He had self-discipline of 
course. Anyone who hunts for subsistence or ekes by his life on the thin
 bounty of the north Alabama woods is a model of patient discipline.<br><br>In the peacetime Army, Charlie Quintard would have been an abject failure as a soldier.<br><br>In a war, well, somewhere in those Cherokee genes of his lurked a warrior.<br><br>Charlie
 had learned that about himself. You see, the meth heads that Phil 
Gordon had run off came back about a year afterward, after Charlie had 
settled in. They had guns, Charlie had a knife and his trusty 'hawk. (He
 was still partly on the grid then, and he hadn't yet acquired his 
primitive bow.)<br><br>The meth heads laughed, and then died in terminal
 surprise as Charlie first evaded and then caught them up close one or 
two at a time. There were eight of them. After disabling their vehicles,
 it had taken him two days. It was the first time he showed anyone the 
way to Dead Man's Holler, which was in fact a real place.<br><br>The first ATF team had been the second.<br><br>This was the third.<br><br>So yes, Charlie Quintard had learned the way of the warrior.<br><br>And
 there was something else that Charlie Quintard had learned. There are 
no obsolete weapons. There are only obsolete ways of employing them - 
obsolete tactics, if you will. An English longbowman of the 14th 
Century, if transplanted to the 21st, could still kill a man at 
distance. He just wouldn't stand in a row in an open field to do it like
 he had at Agincourt or Crecy.<br><br>In fact, in a technological 
society that placed gunfire detectors everywhere in its cities, there 
was an argument to be made that a "primitive" weapon which was 
essentially silent might be of increased utility despite the fact that 
it had been invented a couple of millenia before.<br><br>Also, when you grabbed a man by his belt buckle, a knife or a 'hawk was just as good a way to kill him as any other.<br><br>All
 this Charlie knew. And he knew one other thing. The only way this was 
going to work was if they just disappeared like the first bunch. He had 
to get them all before they were able to climb out of the dead zone that
 kept them from communicating with their bosses back in Birmingham.<br><br>He was, Charlie Quintard knew, going to have to take them to Dead Man's Holler.<br><br>That
 thought took him as far as the big tree above the road cut. The road, 
like almost all roads in Winston County, had first been an animal track,
 then an Indian trail, a wagon road and finally a one lane passage for 
automobiles and logging trucks. Over the years it had worn down until it
 was a cut at least three feet deep along the length of it leading back 
to the cabin.<br><br>What the ATF didn't know was that this was actually
 the old road to Dead Man's Hollow, although you wouldn't find it on any
 modern map. The road had run past the Gordon homestead, turned left 
just about where the boat dock jutted out into Smith Lake and snaked up 
the bluff for about 800 yards before it descended toward the old river 
bed and Dead Man's Hollow. When the Alabama Power Company built the dam 
in the Thirties and Smith Lake had backed up behind it, the rising 
waters filled up to just below the bluff, where the old road now 
dead-ended.<br><br>So the only way out was past this old pine and 
Charlie, figuring that sooner or later he'd find himself at this moment,
 had not only chopped the tree partway through, he'd left the axe nearby
 so, if needed, he could finish the job without delay. Dropping his 
weapons, he snatched up the axe and attacked the pine with a frenzy. He 
heard the Suburban start, and redoubled his efforts. Just as the ATF 
rounded the curve, the tree dropped with a mighty sustained craaaack and
 blocked the path. The gun cops' vehicle was trapped.<br><br>The feds 
vented their fear and frustration by leaping from the Suburban and 
blasting away at where Charlie had been. The truth was that Allen's 
ruined features and their sudden reversal of fortune had unnerved the 
agents. They wanted out of here NOW and they thought they could shoot 
their way clear of this wimp who had somehow transmogrified into an 
invisible deadly menace.<br><br>The truth also was that here, for the first time in his career, Carmichael lost control of his men.<br><br>Without
 orders, two of them, Furlong and James, clambered up the bank to get at
 Charlie and finish this thing. As they appeared at the top of the road 
cut only 25 yards separated them from Charlie Quintard, sheltered behind
 another big pine. Their heads popped into view first.<br><br>In an 
instant, Furlong pitched backward with the fletching of an arrow in his 
left eye and a piece of flint on a broken stick protruding out the back 
of his brain pan.<br><br>James, right beside him, turned his head to 
look at his friend fall long enough to get a similar arrow through his 
jugular, slicing down, chipping the clavicle and then, thanks to the 
angle of the shot, skewering his heart. He fell dead in the brush at the
 top of the road cut, his booted feet hanging at an angle over the road.<br><br>Carmichael
 was seized by panic and wonder. Damn! Nobody can shoot a bow and arrow 
that fast! Could they? Are there two of them? More than two? For the 
first time in his life, Carmichael had the feeling he wasn't going to be
 alive when the sun came up tomorrow. He didn't like the feeling.<br><br>He
 wasn't a religious man but Carmichael realized with a start that if 
there was a God of Abraham, He wouldn't be too pleased about some of the
 ATF supervisor's recent work. And Carmichael did not think that he 
would get a chance to amend his life after today.<br><br>It was 
unbelievable. Focus, dammit. Get a grip. Carmichael struggled to regain 
command of himself. How do we beat this guy? Look at our advantages. We 
outnumber him, but he's already cut us down by half. We've got automatic
 rifles and submachine guns. He's just got a bow, some arrows, a knife 
and maybe that tomahawk. But after losing 3 guys that didn't look like 
such a big deal either. We've got flash bangs, but they're not so 
effective out in the open.<br><br>Carmichael realized with a start that 
he was gazing at Furlong on the road with an arrow sticking out of his 
eye. Helmets. Yeah, they had ACH's in the back of the Suburban. Why 
hadn't he made his people use them? And CS grenades and gas masks. They 
were also in the back. We've been dancing to his tune, Carmichael 
thought. Time to change the dynamic and make him dance to ours.<br><br>They
 were all on the far side of the Suburban from where Charlie had fired 
the arrows. Chambliss was up near the front tire, Duncan in the middle 
and Carmichael at the rear bumper. A plan formed in Carmichael's fevered
 brain.<br><br>It would work. It had to work.<br><br>Charlie also had a 
plan, and he knew he would have to waste at least one arrow to make it 
work. When he saw Duncan open the driver's side passaenger door on the 
far side, he fired arrow number three into the passenger door on his 
side with a loud thunk that made the remaining agents duck. Then he 
moved.<br><br>Bastard, thought Carmichael. Thanks for telling me your 
position. When Duncan emerged from the interior of the Suburban, he 
brought helmets, gas masks and all the CS grenades they had. Carmichael 
told his remaining men what he wanted done. All together. No holding 
back. They nodded. Then they donned the gas masks and helmets.<br><br>When
 Carmichael judged they were ready, he first threw a CS grenade at the 
top of the bank to mask their movement. The wind, such as it was, 
carried the CS cloud slowly away from the road and toward Charlie's 
position. Then they emerged from behind the vehicle, and threw six more 
CS grenades in an arc along their front creating a growing bank of the 
choking gas. Last, they threw their flashbangs into the murk. As they 
released the last of the flashbangs, Carmichael and Chambliss began to 
clamber up the bank while Duncan stood and fired suppressing bursts to 
pin Charlie Quintard in place behind his tree.<br><br>It was a good 
plan, if a bit desperate. If they had kept their heads and done it 
before Furlong and James had bought the farm it might have worked.<br><br>The only problem was - Charlie wasn't there.<br><br>Duncan's
 first intimation that this was so came when a flint-tipped arrow 
entered just above and slightly to the right of his anus and penetrated 
his scrotum, one of his testicles and the base of his penis. It appeared
 in the lower edge of his peripheral vision, sticking out of his fly 
like some stone age parody of an erection. Duncan lost all interest in 
suppressive fire. In fact, he dropped his weapon, fell to his knees, 
clasped his hands around the gory arrow and his ruined manhood, and 
began to scream.<br><br>By the time Carmichael's brain registered that 
scream and concluded that something was terribly wrong with Duncan 
behind him, somebody hit him hard in the kidneys and his body armor 
sprouted a similar arrow from his lower back. Then Chambliss, stopping 
his climb and turning to see what all the fuss was about, took one 
through his right thigh laterally and slid back down the bank, adding 
his screaming to Duncan's.<br><br>HE'S BEHIND US, Carmichael's brain screamed at him.<br><br>For
 a man who was as frightened and disoriented as Carmichael at this 
moment, he actually did rather well. He glimpsed Charlie about to loose 
another arrow at him. In fact, all he saw was the top part of Charlie's 
bow and the head and shoulders behind it.<br><br>It was enough. He raised his MP-5 and let off a long burst that emptied it.<br><br>For
 the uninitiated and untrained, full automatic fire is of limited 
utility except when fighting the Peoples Liberation Army in an alley. 
Absent divine intervention or uncommon luck, at anything except short 
ranges 99 shots out of a hundred will miss. So it was here with 
Carmichael's burst at Charlie Quintard. Of course Charlie's decision to 
hold the arrow shot and duck behind the tree when he saw the MP-5 start 
to rise was also a big factor in his continued existence on the planet.<br><br>Whew, that was close, he thought with relief. Time to go.<br><br>Charlie
 dropped to the forest floor out of sight of the men in the road cut and
 began to crawl away. Behind him, Carmichael changed magazines and, 
keeping low, turned toward the chorus of screams.<br><br>Chambliss had 
made his way over to the shelter of the Suburban and was fumbling with a
 battle dressing. Duncan just stayed where the arrow had found him, 
screaming on and on. Carmichael took it all in at a glance. Realizing 
Duncan could help him no longer and desperately craving silence to 
think, Carmichael came up behind the agent, drew his pistol and, placing
 the muzzle just below the back lip of the wounded man's ACH, blew his 
brains out. Duncan spasmed and fell over on his side in the road, his 
agony of no further concern to anybody, including him.<br><br>Chambliss watched him dully, wondering despite the pain if Carmichael was going to do him too. He wasn't. Not yet.<br><br>But
 what he was going to do was get the hell out of this killing zone. 
First, if Chambliss is going to be of use, that arrow has got to come 
out. Carmichael knelt down and without warning grabbed the business end 
of the arrow that was sticking out from Chambliss' thigh and broke it 
off. Chambliss, not unexpectedly, screamed once more. Then, Carmichael 
grabbed the fletching sticking out of the other side and jerked the 
arrow free, a greasy tongue of blood trying to follow along. Using his 
combat knife, he cut the uniform pants away from the wound, then took 
the battle dressing from Chambliss' shaking hand and applied it. Then he
 had Chambliss pull the arrow out of his body armor.<br><br>"Ready to travel?" Carmichael asked.<br><br>Chambliss replied, "Yeah. Where?"<br><br>"We're going back down to the lake and see if this prick has a boat."<br><br>The
 Suburban motor still ticked over. Carefully, staying as low as 
possible, they got Chambliss in the front passenger side. Carmichael 
moved around the vehicle to take the wheel. As he passed Charlie's third
 arrow sticking out of the door, he angrily broke it off.<br><br>Stone age weapons. Shit.<br><br>If he got out of this, he was going to have this place nuked.<br><br>Sonofabitch.<br><br>Suddenly,
 randomly, a memory from the Nineties welled up. He had helped execute a
 search warrant on a member of the American Indian Movement. The old 
Sioux woman had a bumpersticker on her refrigerator door: "Custer Wore 
an Arrow Shirt."<br><br>Carmichael had thought it funny then.<br><br>He didn't now.<br><br>Gaining
 the driver's seat, he slammed the door and threw the Suburban into 
reverse, running over the bodies of Furlong and Duncan in the mad dash 
down to the lake.<br><br>Charlie heard the screaming and heard the shot.
 In the silence that followed there was only one conclusion to draw. 
Damn, they're killing their own wounded. OK, so there were maybe two of 
them left. At least one of those was wounded, for he heard other, 
different screams after the shot. They'll go for the lake now. He knew 
it.<br><br>Even so, he waited for the Suburban to move as proof of his 
guess. Yeah, the SUV was faster than he was, but he had a straight line 
to run to get down there, while the Suburban had to stick to the snaky 
road. The Suburban moved, and Charlie Quintard began to run.<br><br>What
 if there wasn't a boat? Carmichael wondered as he backed frantically 
down the road. The Indian didn't have a car, why would he have a boat? 
In retrospect, Carmichael couldn't believe how stupid he'd been, how 
arrogant and ignorant. He'd completely misread the Indian and mishandled
 the whole deal. Why didn't we search the whole place, including the 
dock? I'd know if there was a boat then. Forget that. There HAD to be a 
boat there, so there must be one. It was the last thread he clung to. He
 really, really didn't want to die here beside this godforsaken cabin.<br><br>And, after a fashion, he got his wish.<br><br>There
 were large privet bushes blocking the path of the Suburban from the 
dock, and they also blocked Carmichael's view of the lake. In his panic,
 Carmichael failed to note that what appeared to be a driveway that dead
 ended at the privet actually turned to the left and went up the bluff. 
If he'd known he wouldn't have cared. It was the lake that beckoned him.
 It was only on the lake that he might escape this uncanny, vengeful 
Indian with his deadly stone age weapons. The lake would save him.<br><br>When
 the Suburban stopped, Carmichael leaped from it with his MP-5. His 
intention was to leave the hobbled Chambliss to the Indian's tender 
mercies and thus buy himself enough time to escape.<br><br>Chambliss 
tumbled from the vehicle too and realized instantly what the plan was. 
"Wait!" he had time to yell, then went down as another of Charlie's 
arrows hit him in the buttocks and drove through to sever the femoral 
artery in his left leg.<br><br>Chambliss pitched forward on his face, 
out of the fight. He wasn't dead yet, but he would be shortly. Roger 
Chambliss gave himself up to the idea, and spent his last minutes on 
earth thinking about his wife and kids and what an idiot he'd been not 
to listen to Carol when she'd begged him to get out of the ATF after 
Sipsey Street. When he went to meet his Maker, it was in fear that he 
would receive what he deserved.<br><br>Carmichael saw Chambliss go down 
and he realized belatedly that Charlie had been firing low to hit them 
where they weren't covered by helmet or body armor. As he ran from the 
Suburban toward and around the privet and heading for the dock, he 
loosed off a burst toward the cabin where Charlie must be sheltering.<br><br>Charlie
 was on the side of the cabin away from the Suburban and moving to the 
rear so he could get a shot at Carmichael if he showed himself in the 
direction of the lake. The same cleared space that Agent Allen had 
intended to use against him now worked in his favor. Carmichael would 
not be able to get down there without exposing himself to Charlie's bow.<br><br>Even
 so, Carmichael tried. The first arrow missed, the second hit Carmichael
 in the right bicep breaking his upper arm and pinning it it to his body
 armor. He staggered, but kept going. The next arrow also missed, but 
the fourth hit him in the ankle and swept him from his feet, and he 
landed hard still well short of the dock. The pain was excruciating.<br><br>Charlie was down to one arrow, which was nocked and ready to fly. There were more in the cabin, but for right now, this was it.<br><br>Carmichael
 still had his MP-5 and his pistol, but his ability to use them was 
strictly limited by his injuries. He never practiced weak-side shooting,
 thinking he'd never need it. He doubted he could even get to his pistol
 with his left hand and while he could spray and pray with the MP-5, he 
doubted he could hit Charlie unless he presented himself meekly for 
execution.<br><br>This did not seem likely.<br><br>So Carmichael did the only thing left to him that he could think of.<br><br>He surrendered.<br><br>"HEY!"
 he yelled. "Hey! I surrender! Don't shoot me anymore!" With his left 
hand he fumbled with the attachment point of the MP-5's sling.<br><br>"Throw
 away your guns!" responded Charlie. "I'm trying," said Carmichael 
weakly. Finally, he unhooked the subgun and tossed it away. He tried to 
reach the pistol and couldn't. He told Charlie so.<br><br>"All right. 
Just keep quiet and don't move," Charlie ordered. He moved up to the 
wounded Carmichael. Careful, Charlie told himself. Carmichael seemed 
deep into an appreciation of his pain, but it could be an act. He 
approached from Carmichael's wounded right side, dropped his bow and 
drew his knife. He held the knife to Carmichael's throat while he 
stripped him of his pistol and tossed it away. Then he did the same with
 the ATF man's combat knife. He was about to help Carmichael up when he 
spotted something familiar sticking out of his combat pants' cargo 
pocket.<br><br>It was his medicine bag. Carmichael saw Charlie 
Quintard's eyes narrow. He had taken it from Duncan on a lark, a 
souvenir he was going to give to his wife. But now he saw the look on 
Quintard's face and thought he saw a door closing.<br><br>"I wish you hadn't done that," said Charlie. He paused. "I wish you hadn't shot Push too."<br><br>"You said you wouldn't shoot me," Carmichael pleaded.<br><br>"I'm not going to shoot you," Charlie said in a hard, flat voice, "I'm going to take you to Dead Man's Holler."<br><br>Carmichael felt relief wash through him. "Where is it?" he asked.<br><br>Charlie
 ignored him. He stripped off Carmichael's helmet, webgear, and body 
armor with the ATF man alternately yelling and weeping in pain. He also 
broke off the arrows sticking out of Carmichael. He shreiked when the 
Indian did that.<br><br>"I gotta get to a doctor," Carmichael pleaded.<br><br>"You'll get a Doctor when you get to Dead Man's Holler," replied Charlie. "Where's your flexcuffs?"<br><br>"I don't carry them. I'm a supervisor. Chambliss might have some."<br><br>Charlie grunted. "Don't move," he ordered.<br><br>Carmichael,
 holding onto the hope of Dead Man's Hollow, did as he was told. 
Policing up Carmichael's weapons and his own bow as he went, Charlie 
went over to Chambliss' still form by the Suburban. He was dead. He also
 had two pairs of flexcuffs.<br><br>Leaving the weapons on the ground, 
Charlie returned to Carmichael and, pulling the zipties tight, he cuffed
 the ATF man's hands and feet.<br><br>"Hey!" protested Carmichael, "You don't have to do that."<br><br>"Yes, I do," said Charlie. "I'll be back in a few minutes. Don't go anywhere," he said with a faint smile.<br><br>The ATF agent cursed, gritting his teeth in pain.<br><br>In
 less than five minutes, Carmichael heard the Suburban drive away. And 
after a long half hour, it came back. Charlie appeared and hoisted 
Carmichael, first to his feet and then in a fireman's carry onto 
Quintard's back.<br><br>Even through his pain, Carmichael marveled at 
the Indian's strength. Damn, I'm twice his size and he tosses me around 
like a pillow.<br><br>When they got around the privet bushes, Carmichael
 saw the Suburban was stacked with the bodies of his men, across the 
width of the back floor and seat. They had been systematically stripped 
of their weapons, helmets, body armor, radios and load bearing vests. 
Quintard had even taken their boots. Charlie set him down by the front 
passenger door, which was open. He was none too gentle and Carmichael 
screamed. Then Charlie picked him up and put him in the passenger seat. 
Taking one of the dead agent's belts he had scavenged, Quintard ran it 
through a bracket on the seat and the flex cuffs on Carmichael's legs, 
connecting the two.<br><br>"I'll drive," he said with another one of those enigmatic half-smiles.<br><br>The
 Suburban smelled of blood, shit and brains as it ground its way up the 
bluff road toward Dead Man's Holler. Every bounce was a purgatory of 
pain for Carmichael. Charlie Quintard was humming, but Carmichael 
couldn't make out the tune. Finally, they came to the top, crested the 
bluff and began to go down. A few hundred yards later they were staring 
at the lake, which was about fifty yards down the hill. Charlie stopped 
the vehicle and set the parking brake.<br><br>Before he got out, Charlie
 put down the all of the door windows in the vehicle about 2 inches or 
so. He took two more belts and secured the steering wheel.<br><br>Carmichael finally realized in horror what was about to happen. "You can't!" he shouted at Charlie.<br><br>"Hey,"
 said Charlie, "None of that. You said you wanted to go to Dead Man's 
Holler and here we are. You see, it got its name from being a deep 
ravine down by the old river bed where, every now and again back in the 
1800s, somebody would dump a dead man's body in it. When Smith Lake 
backed up over it after they built the dam, it filled up with water and 
became the deepest part of the lake. Phil Gordon's family homestead used
 to be down there. And that's where yer goin'."<br><br>"YOU CAN'T!" screamed Carmichael.<br><br>Charlie
 Quintard looked at him without remorse. "That's what I said just before
 you killed my dog." Charlie reached in, pulled the brake release and 
slammed the door as the Suburban surrendered to the force of gravity and
 began to trundle down the road toward the water.<br><br>"NO!" he heard 
Carmichael scream, just before the vehicle hit the water with a huge 
splash and glided farther out into the lake just about dead center over 
Dead Man's Hollow. As the SUV began to settle into its final plunge, 
Charlie wondered if Carmichael knew why he called it 'Dead Man's Holler'
 instead of 'Dead Man's Hollow'. Quintard was educated enough to know 
the correct pronunciation. Yeah, he spoke natural Winston County 
southern, so Hollow would normally come out 'Holler' anyway.<br><br>But he called it Dead Man's Holler for another reason.<br><br>Just as the SUV nosed down into its final dive, the dead man inside started to holler, "NOOOOO!"<br><br>He did so, until he ran out of air somewhere just short of the bottom of Smith Lake.<br><br>Charlie turned and walked back up the bluff. He still had to bury Pushmataha. Even so, he was humming.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Well the Good Book says, and I know its the truth,<br>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.<br>You'd better watch where you go<br>And remember where you've been.<br>That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man.</span><br><br>(To be continued . . .)</p>

							<p>There's a lot of truth in this chapter about "obsolete" 
weapons.  Fact is, an 18th century musket is just as lethal at X yards 
as it was then, and knives, arrows, etc. can and do still get used to 
kill people.  You see, neither the weapons nor the human body has 
changed in the time since those weapons were invented.</p>

							<p>Excellent read! I absolutely agree with the "obsolete weapons"
 paragraph. When the Guomingdang 29th Army went up against the Japanese 
Manchukuo Army in 1931, their main armament was the broadsword, while 
the Japanese were equipped with the latest technology of that time.<br><br>When
 the battle was over, the entire Japanese Manchukuo Army was 
slaughtered. The 29th Army was led by 19 year old Zheng Yu, who 
personally hacked to death over 50 Japanese during the fight. Every 
single Guomingdang soldier's uniform was drenched in the enemy's blood. 
World War II actually began right there in Heillongjiang. The Japanese 
were so weakened by that particular fight that they never recovered 
fully, even though they did invade the Chinese mainland and committed 
some of the most horrific atrocities.<br><br>Re: Sean. Read on and you 
will find that a new coon dog puppy will be waiting for Charlie after he
 recovered from injuries on one of his missions :D</p>
