 the Civil War, entire battles were sometimes fought within a few miles 
of troops who passed the day unaware that their comrades-in-arms were 
fighting desperately. In other times and places, the sounds of battle 
have reverberated and carried for many miles. This is especially true 
across bodies of water.<br><br>You know, like Smith Lake.<br><br>For 
sound and fury, the skirmish at the old Gordon cabin hadn't been much as
 skirmishes go, all the gunfire being one-sided. And Smith Lake and the 
Bankhead National Forest are no strangers to echoing gunshots from 
hunters, target shooters and occasional drunken white boys blasting 
holes in federal, state and local signage. But automatic weapons fire is
 a bit rarer and would have drawn the notice of curious passersby -- not
 that there were many of those in Charlie Quintard's neck of the woods 
-- even in the peaceful days before the Battle of Sipsey Street and the 
disappearance of the first four ATF agents right afterward.<br><br>But now?<br><br>Well,
 now only an idiot would dismiss that episodic, fat-in-the-fire 
sustained crackle echoing through the woods and across the water as 
anything else but evidence that the undeclared civil war which had begun
 on Sipsey Street had come home to Phil Gordon's birthplace.<br><br>Now 
as it happened only two people who heard the sounds of the death agony 
of the ATF's second team understood the probable cause of what they were
 hearing. One was Jimmy Flynn, who had just turned 19 and was at the 
moment trying to get into Katy Dobson's drawers. The fact that Jimmy was
 still in the preliminaries of talking Katy into what he had in mind 
played a part in his realization. Had he been farther along in the 
process he might not have noticed at all. But Katy was no pushover. In 
fact she had no intention of giving Jimmy what he wanted just then. Her 
own personal standards required at least an engagement ring before 
surrendering her secrets, even if she loved young Mr. Flynn, which she 
did.<br><br>So Jimmy was still in possession of his faculties when the first burst of pistol shots that killed Pushmataha rang out.<br><br>Huh,
 he thought, that wasn't far away. Some feller with a semi-auto pistol 
shootin' a snake probably. There were plenty of snakes up this way.<br><br>The
 rock with the beautiful view of the river that Jimmy had chosen for 
courting the hard-to-get Miss Dobson was probably the least snaky place 
around here, which was why he had chosen it. Nothing like an Eastern 
Diamondback rattler or a copperhead to ruin the mood.<br><br>But when 
the paroxysm of fire at the pine roadblock echoed up to him, Jimmy Flynn
 knew exactly what was going on and he sat up straight. Damn, he 
thought. It's the ATF again. The Suburban had passed them on the main 
road before turning off in front of them, heading down to the old Gordon
 place.<br><br>Jimmy knew about the ATF. Will Shipman, the commander of 
both his re-enactment unit and the newly organized Free State 
Constitutional Militia of which Jimmy was a proud member, had told him 
all about them. Jimmy idolized Will. He'd been places and done things 
that Jimmy dreamed he might one day see and do. Now, he heard the 
gunfire and realized that Will needed to know about this.<br><br>Having 
more youthful enthusiasm than sense, had Jimmy been on his own he might 
have moved toward the sound of the guns to discover what was really 
happening. But he couldn't do that with Katy in tow.<br><br>Katy, 
unmindful of the sound at first and not understanding a bit why Jimmy 
was no longer paying attention to HER, asked petulantly, "What's the 
matter?"<br><br>"That's gunfire," explained Jimmy.<br><br>Katy had heard
 gunfire all her life. Everybody up in Winston County owned a gun and 
her daddy had taught her how to shoot from when she was tee-niney. She 
did not, however, have an educated ear for gunfire, nor was she 
particularly interested in it. What she was interested in was becoming 
Jimmy Flynn's wife and having his babies -- in that order.<br><br>"Somebody
 shooting a snake," she explained. There were a whole lot more snakes 
than guns in Winston County, and anybody who lived outside of town had 
shot one, or seen one shot.<br><br>Jimmy started to explain that it was 
machinegun fire and nobody shot snakes with machineguns, but the natural
 caution that his daddy had taught, and occasionally beat into, him took
 over.<br><br>"Don't run your mouth," his daddy had said, "until you've 
got somethin' to say and you know who's listening." And one other thing -
 "No woman ever kept a secret, except her own."<br><br>This much Jimmy 
could work out for himself. There were four ATF men missing. The whole 
county knew about the Suburban behind the Sheriff's Office. The feds 
were offering $10,000 for information about what might have happened to 
them. Everybody in town had a guess.<br><br>Will Shipman had told him 
with a wink, "I guess they ran into something in the woods. Maybe they 
were eaten by trolls." There were crackheads in town who had already 
sold their souls for far less and who would rat out their own mothers 
for a rock, but nobody had a clue.<br><br>And Will Shipman told Jimmy 
Flynn something else, "Well, its like my old Army buddy Scarpetti used 
to say, 'Three men can keep a secret if two of them are dead.'" Meaning 
whoever accomplished the disappearance of the ATF agents was probably 
working alone.<br><br>Which meant that, since the random disappearance 
of ATF agents in the wake of the agency's attack on Phil Gordon was 
viewed by almost everybody in Winston County, heck, the entire state of 
Alabama, as a positive social good, whoever was on the receiving end of 
that gunfire was doing the Lord's own work this day. Therefore, it would
 not do to draw Katy Dobson's attention to it. Momma raised ugly kids, 
not dumb ones, Jimmy thought. That was something else his daddy had 
said.<br><br>So Jimmy Flynn gave up any thought of getting in Katy 
Dobson's drawers that day, laid back down beside her on the blanket and 
cuddled her, listening hard for more shots. In due time, as Charlie 
Quintard matched his bow and arrows against the ATF's M-4s and MP-5s, he
 heard them.<br><br>When the flash bangs went off, though, even Katy sat up. "What was THAT?" she exclaimed.<br><br>"Oh,"
 said Jimmy, "I think its somebody celebrating with fireworks. Don't 
worry about it." And then he said something that he couldn't believe 
later he had, although the thought had been growing in him for some 
time. Strangely, the sounds of the war close by crystallized it for him.<br><br>"Katy,
 would you marry me? I know I don't make much at the factory, but with 
times being the way they are now, I just don't think we should wait. 
Will you marry me?"<br><br>Katy was flabbergasted and forgot all about 
the bangs and booms. The campaign for Jimmy Flynn's wedding ring was 
carefully mapped out in her head and should have taken at least another 
three months. "Oh, yes, Jimmy, yes!"<br><br>They kissed then, and kept 
on kissing. In fact, Jimmy Flynn could have gotten into Katy Dobson's 
drawers at that moment, but strangely all he wanted to do was hold her 
tight as he listened intently to the sounds of the forest, the lake and 
the odd gunshots echoing across them.<br><br>Men, thought Katy. I'll never understand them. But she didn't care. She was going to be Mrs. Jimmy Flynn after all.<br><br>And wouldn't Lori Peterson just be jealous fit to bust?<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>The
 other person who heard the shots and knew what he was hearing was 
Carter Johnson, the Sheriff of Winston County. Actually, the only shots 
that he heard came from the last burst of Carmichael's MP-5. He had been
 headed north on the lake in his bass boat, christened "Semper Fi," with
 his nephew Donald Waters, supposedly looking for the missing four ATF 
agents but actually to get away from the phones, the nagging press, the 
demanding feds and do a little bit of fishing. So, what with the noise 
of the motor going full-tilt-boogie and the bang of the water against 
the hull, Sheriff Johnson didn't hear anything.<br><br>Something penetrated his subconscious though.<br><br>Something was not right.<br><br>His
 premonitions had served him well over the years, first in Vietnam and 
then in a lifetime in law enforcement, and he had learned to pay 
attention to them. The last time had been when he was about to kick in 
the door to an untended meth lab a few years back, and something nagged 
at his brain not to do it. He went around to the side of the trailer, 
stepped up on a milk crate and peeped in the window. There was a 
tripwire attached to the door. He couldn't see what it was attached to, 
but he decided to disassemble a back window and go in that way. It took 
him and the deputies 45 minutes to do that with the poor set of tools 
they had, but their patience was rewarded.<br><br>They got to live.<br><br>On
 the other end of the trip wire was an M18A1 Claymore directional mine 
that was later determined to have been listed as "expended in training" 
back in the 1980s at Camp Shelby, Mississippi.<br><br>So when something 
niggled at the back of his head, something that his wife had called his 
"spider sense," Carter Johnson paid attention. He cut the boat motor and
 listened.<br><br>Silence. Then, "Brrrrrp." Then, nothing.<br><br>He 
couldn't even tell what side of the lake it had come from. A 
submachinegun, though, he was certain. He waited for a second burst to 
help him, or some gunfire in reply but nothing happened. He turned to 
his nephew to see if he had heard it and saw his head bobbing up and 
down to the MP-3 player.<br><br>Moron.<br><br>For a few minutes more he sat there waiting, until his nephew got curious and asked why they'd stopped.<br><br>"Thought
 I heard something," Johnson growled. He was beginning to think that 
hiring his nephew as a deputy was the biggest mistake he'd ever made in 
life, up to and including the time he stepped in a punji trap during 
Operation Tuscaloosa at An Hoa in 1967.<br><br>There wasn't a thing 
about the boy that didn't irritate him and if his sister hadn't begged 
him in front of their sainted mother he wouldn't have brought him on 
board. The kid was only here in the boat to be his flunky anyway, to 
hand out the beer and bait the hooks, which unfortunately was all he was
 qualified for. Skeeter Haynes, former Birmingham police captain and his
 likely primary opposition had already been nosing around, asking sly 
questions and making pointed comments about "nepotism." The election 
wasn't until next year, but the Sheriff had already made up his mind to 
dump him on some other poor, unsuspecting police department before it 
became an issue. They owed him a favor down in Walker County. But then, 
that place was crooked as a dog's hind leg and Donny was stupid enough 
that he'd probably get himself killed the first week.<br><br>His sister wouldn't thank him for THAT.<br><br>He
 let the boat drift for a while, then restarted the engine and very 
slowly chugged upriver out in the middle of the channel, still unsure of
 which side the sound had come from, trying to listen over the low 
mutter of the engine. He actually passed Dead Man's Holler on his right 
while Charlie was policing up the ATF bodies at the roadblock. 
Carmichael heard the boat, but thought it was something Charlie was up 
to so he stayed quiet, grinding his teeth in pain. And although the 
Sheriff could see the dock and Charlie's pole sticking out of the 
fixture, brush shielded his view of the hog-tied ATF supervisor. Thus, 
Carmichael's last chance for life passed upstream.<br><br>By the time 
the dead man hollered, Sheriff Johnson was passing the second bend above
 the old Gordon place and heard not a thing. But he HAD heard SOMETHING.
 His intuition borne of long experience with the Feds told him that they
 had done something stupid again.<br><br>Indeed, they seemed to always 
be doing something stupid. Did they have a test or something that said, 
"Hey, if you're kneejerk stupid, we want you in the ATF"? It seemed like
 it. Ever since they'd been reinvigorated by the Gun Control Act of 
1968, they'd been doing deadly stupidities, from the Kenyon Ballew 
shooting to Waco to Sipsey Street.<br><br>And that last was pure-dee 
DUMB. He knew Phil Gordon well. He grew up with him and went to school 
with him, although he was two years older than Phil and graduated 
sooner. Johnson had gone straight into the Marines after graduation, 
Phil went into the Army two years later. Phil was a serious shooter and a
 self-effacing southern gentleman, a devout Christian and good family 
man who'd raised a passel of accomplished kids. If he had a vice it was 
running his mouth about injustice and government excesses, which was why
 the ATF had targeted him, probably.<br><br>But whatever their made-up 
excuse, and no matter how many ATF agents he had killed in self-defense,
 the folks up here figured that it was the ATF and not Phil Gordon, who 
had it coming. And if now some more ATF agents had gone missing, well, 
wasn't that just too bad? Winston County had a long history of making 
"authorities" like Confederate Home Guards and conscription officers, as
 well as a hundred and forty years of state and federal liquor and tax 
revenue agents, disappear. That four more were now missing was seen by 
Winston Countians, after the death of someone they knew and respected, 
as merely the latest episode in the region's proud, independent saga. 
Feds were SUPPOSED to disappear up here, didn't THEY know THAT? And if 
the perpretrators were not caught, then that was OK with most of the 
voters too.<br><br>One other thing. Sheriff Carter Johnson knew that if 
he was seen by the voters as a tool of the Feds and not the local 
standard bearer of law enforcement, he didn't have a hope in hell of 
getting re-elected. Skeeter Haynes would see to that.<br><br>So those 
were the horns of his dilemma, now made worse by the thought that with 
that burst of submachinegun fire, some more ATF agents may have just 
been disappeared, or killed, or whatever. Or maybe they'd get lucky, bag
 their trophy, and leave the county, and more importantly, leave Sheriff
 Carter Johnson the hell alone. Of course, if they killed somebody that 
the local folks deemed innocent, like Phil Gordon, the resentments would
 wash over him because he hadn't protected them long enough to get a 
fair trial. As if there was anything such like in the federal court 
system these days. And the Feds had already proven they didn't trust him
 enough to consult him about anything, so what could he do? In any case,
 his life was about to get a lot more miserable.<br><br>As a result, the Sheriff finished what he had set out to do that morning.<br><br>He fished.<br><br>He
 tried not to worry about missing ATF agents and submachinegun fire in 
the forest and pondered over how to get rid of his nephew without 
getting him killed. As if to deliberately compound his frustration, the 
fish refused to bite. Maybe if Skeeter Haynes wants my job, I should pay
 him back by letting him have it.<br><br>A poor bastard he'd be then.<br><br>Just like me.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>"Tell
 me that again, slowly," Will Shipman ordered Jimmy Flynn. They were 
sitting alone in Will Shipman's kitchen, sharing coffee and secrets. It 
was the night of the skirmish at the old Gordon cabin.<br><br>So Jimmy 
did, slowly. The Suburban passing him, US government plates, packed with
 stone-faced men in combat gear, the automatic weapons fire, the booms, 
the whiff of tear gas as he and Katy had driven home past the entrance 
to the old Gordon place on the way home. And oh, yeah, could Will 
believe it? He, Jimmy Flynn, was getting married.<br><br>That part was 
easy. His wife had told him to expect it four months ago. Women were 
wise in the way of such things, while most men like Jimmy (and me, 
thought Will wistfully) were merely targets on female radar screens, 
ready to be brought down by charm, feminine wiles and pheremones.<br><br>But
 if another bunch of ATF had truly met misfortune in the Bankhead, this 
county was about to be torn apart, and the Feds were likely going to 
come looking for yours truly, Will knew. He had made no secret of his 
opinions of the innocence of Phil Gordon and the guilt of the ATF for 
the Battle of Sipsey Street. And some folks even knew about his militia 
activities. This was not good. He had to first verify that something had
 actually happened, without raising suspicions, of course. In addition, 
he knew he had to figure out quickly who was responsible for taking on 
and apparently defeating two ATF teams. He had a guess, but it didn't 
seem possible. The man he suspected didn't even own a firearm.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>The
 morning after Sheriff Johnson's fishing trip, the ATF was confirming, 
in a backhanded sort of way by asking about them, that some more of 
their agents had come up missing. It was six this time. The regional 
office in Nashville called, wanting to know if there was another 
Suburban behind his office. There wasn't. But there were more details 
about this team's mission than there had been the last time. They'd had 
only one destination -- Phil Gordon's old cabin on the lake -- which was
 right close by where the Sheriff heard the shots yesterday. The Sheriff
 knew who lived there, and like Will Shipman, he couldn't believe it 
either.<br><br>But before Sheriff Johnson set out to find Charlie 
Quintard, he had to very carefully consider whether he really wanted to 
find him. He knew that the ATF, who had undercover agents crawling all 
over Double Springs (they stuck out like sore thumbs), wouldn't stop 
until they found their men and the killer or killers. What he was trying
 to determine was, did he want to help them or hinder them? Which would 
get him re-elected? If, that is, he wanted to be re-elected at all in 
this brave new world gone mad.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>For
 his part, Charlie Quintard had been a very busy man since he buried 
Pushmataha. He'd policed up all the ATF's firearms and equipment (he had
 quite a gun collection by now, what with the meth heads and the Feds 
leaving things lying around on the ground) and stashed them in two 55 
gallon drums off of Phil Gordon's property out in the Bankhead National 
Forest in a little cave he had found a couple of years ago.<br><br>He'd 
also done his best to clean up the forensic detritus of the skirmish, 
picking up brass, wiping out the Suburban's tire tracks and covering 
over torn up undergrowth with mud and camouflage vegetation of various 
kinds. He even repaired, for the second time, the lock on his door. It 
was not going to be enough, he knew. For one thing, it was impossible to
 find all the brass in the thick undergrowth. If somebody came out here 
with a metal detector they were bound to find what he couldn't.<br><br>It
 was time to leave the Gordon cabin. He hated it, but he knew he had no 
choice. It was going to be back to the woods like his ancestors and his 
life was going to be a lot rougher. But in order to do it, he needed 
help moving his larder.<br><br>Now, before the place flooded with Feds.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>"I've
 gotta get me some more deputies," Barton Meigs murmured to himself in 
his Nashville office, bitterly recalling the line of Brian Dennehy's 
crooked sheriff in Silverado. No shit. First the wholesale slaughter of 
more than a hundred agents in the Battle of Sipsey Street, then four, 
followed by six more, missing up in Winston County on a stupid follow up
 search. Three more dead (and six wounded) in Cherokee County, Alabama 
on what should have been a piece-of-cake no-knock against a gunshop 
owner for straw-man sales. Only the dickhead decided he wasn't going to 
be arrested that day or any other and went down fighting.<br><br>Worse, 
it was done so stupidly that we managed to kill his wife and six year 
old daughter in the collateral damage. Two more agents wounded in a 
similar incident in Pulaski, Tennessee.<br><br>"Has the ATF Declared War
 on the American People?" read the headline on the editorial in the Wall
 Street Journal this morning. The subhead read, "Or Have the American 
People Declared War on the ATF?"<br><br>Good questions.<br><br>For the 
thousandth time, he cursed his predecessor at this desk. HE was the 
idiot who'd initiated the Phil Gordon investigation because he didn't 
like what the moke was saying about him and the agency. As if we've ever
 been popular, Meigs snorted. Well, the dumbshit had started a war and 
the only thing good Barton Meigs could say about him was that Phil 
Gordon had made him pay with his life for his terminal stupidity.<br><br>Meigs hoped the Devil was giving his predecessor a personal After Action Review in Hell right now.<br><br>The
 dirty little secret of the ATF, and indeed of all federal law 
enforcement including the IRS, was on display for anyone who had the 
eyes to see. As big and bad, as omniscient and omnipresent as we pretend
 to be in a country this size, we ain't and we'll never be. It was the 
whole Wizard of Oz thing. Most people bought the display, but some folks
 didn't. And he could shout, "Pay no attention to the man behind the 
curtain" all he wanted, but it didn't mean he could conjure live agents 
to replace dead ones out of thin air.<br><br>If this turns into a war, 
we lose. Unless the military comes in on our side, which Barton Meigs 
figured it wouldn't. The nasty arguments he had with his brother the 
Major General like clockwork every Thanksgiving told him as much.<br><br>Worse
 than the casualties were the resignations sweeping the agency. Nobody 
wanted to risk getting killed short of retirement, it seemed. There were
 rumors of a "national emergency stop loss" order from D.C., but all 
that did was accellerate the exodus. The unions were screaming bloody 
murder too. If the President decided to make this a national "law and 
order" crusade as was the rumor, this was going to get very ugly. Some 
people just don't know when to back off. We did it after Waco, didn't 
we? We managed to save the agency when everybody, including the 
turf-jealous FBI, wanted us gone.<br><br>But Clinton, for all the names 
the conservatives called him had in the end been a pragmatic politician,
 perhaps because he was just in it for the broads. But this President? 
This guy was a true believer and arrogant to boot. The President, whose 
photo hung behind him on the wall, was just the kind of man to take a 
terrible situation and make it truly horrific.<br><br>Meigs looked at an
 organization chart for his region that had been adjusted to reflect the
 losses since Sipsey Street. There were more holes than filled 
positions, even after the wave of emergency transfers in from all over 
the country. The loss of institutional memory represented by those empty
 slots was staggering. Every single outstanding case now in progress or 
in the courts in the southeastern United States had been affected. Real 
criminals, not bumbling gun dealers guilty of paperwork errors or target
 shooters guilty of nothing but malfunctioning semi-auto rifles, were 
getting off on dismissed charges. Vicious rapists, drug dealers and 
killers, were walking because we picked on the wrong guy and he fed us 
our own ass.<br><br>Meigs had been all through what paper trail remained
 on Gordon in ATF files. The guy hadn't been a "terrorist" as the 
national PR spokesmen of his agency were saying. He was just a 
loudmouth. A very talented loudmouth who had two things: tactical 
warning of ATF intentions and nothing to lose. He thought of his 
predecessor and cursed him, again.<br><br>You stupid SOB. Burn in Hell.<br><br>His secretary broke in on his foul mood. "Sir, Assistant Director Atherton is on line three for you."<br><br>Oh, God, what now? He picked up the handset and punched the line button.<br><br>"Meigs."<br><br>"Meigs, this is AD Atherton."<br><br>"Yes, sir?"<br><br>"I've
 just come from a meeting with the Director and the Attorney General. 
The decision has been taken to get you some more help."<br><br>"That's good news sir." Meigs paused, "Transfers from the FBI and other agencies?"<br><br>"No,
 they've got their own demands. We're working on something much bigger 
to deal with this whole problem of domestic gun terrorism."<br><br>Uh, oh, thought Meigs, that's a new term. "Yes, sir?"<br><br>"Yes.
 You'll be briefed on that when we've finalized the operational plan, 
but for now I'm sending you a man who can fill up your T.O. &amp; E. 
with operational bodies to make up for your grievous losses."<br><br>"Who, sir?"<br><br>"John
 Claxton of Brightfire. He'll be in Nashville tomorrow morning. It's an 
open-ended contract. Tell him what you need and he'll get it for you. 
They're a very capable firm with a lot of experience. Money is no 
object."<br><br>Meigs was silent.<br><br>"Meigs," said the AD, "Do you have any questions about this?"<br><br>Meigs
 decided to risk it. "Sir, I need experienced federal law enforcement 
officers, even inexperienced ones will do in a pinch, but I need agents,
 I don't need mercenaries unfamiliar with the way we do things."<br><br>The AD was silent for a moment, which Meigs knew to be a bad sign.<br><br>"Meigs?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"'The way we do things' is about to change. Work with Claxton or find another job."<br><br>"Yes, sir." Meigs heard the click on the other end and set down the handset.<br><br>Mercenaries.<br><br>Shit and shove me in it.<br><br>Mercenaries.<br><br>Early retirement was starting to look pretty good after all.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>Will Shipman was locking up for the night when a soft tap came at his back door. "Huh?"<br><br>His
 dogs hadn't barked. That was weird. They usually announced every car 
that passed by down on the road. Will reached on top of the tall shelf 
in the hall leading to the kitchen and retrieved an M1911 .45 pistol. He
 racked the slide and eased to the back of the house. The kitchen lights
 were already off. He peeked through the curtain at the window over the 
sink and saw someone standing in the soft glow of the back porchlight.<br><br>"Charlie?"<br><br>Will
 safed the weapon, tucked it in his belt behind him Mexican style, moved
 to the door and opened it. Sure enough. It was Charlie Quintard.<br><br>"Can I come in, Will?" Quintard asked softly through the screen door. "I need to talk to you about somethin'."<br><br>"Sure Charlie, come on in," Will said as he pushed the screen door open for Charlie to enter.<br><br>"Have
 a seat," Will invited, indicating the same kitchen table he'd talked 
with Jimmy Flynn at a few hours before. "Can I get you a cup of coffee, 
or somethin'?"<br><br>"No coffee," said Charlie, "but a glass of water would be nice. I've been walkin' for a ways."<br><br>"All the way from Phil's place?" That was twenty miles or more, for Will lived clean on the other side of Double Springs.<br><br>"Naw,
 I hitchhiked most of the way, but after dark I couldn't get any more 
rides so I jest walked. It's been a long day." The weariness in Charlie 
Quintard's voice was evident.<br><br>Will got him a glass and the 
pitcher of water Mary kept in the fridge and poured Charlie a drink. He 
left the pitcher on the table and sat down across from the Indian, 
waiting in silence while Charlie slaked his thirst.<br><br>"How can I help you, Charlie?" he asked after Quintard emptied the glass, worried about the answer he might get.<br><br>When Charlie finished telling him almost an hour later, Will Shipman realized that he hadn't been worried enough.<br><br>But first Will had a question: "Why me?"<br><br>"'We
 always knew that someday we were going to have to draw the line. Phil 
Gordon drew it and the Feds stepped over it. It's time to shove back.'"<br><br>Will
 was smart enough to know when his own words were being quoted back to 
him. Even so, he was darn sure that Charlie hadn't been there when he 
said them at the first muster of the Free State Constitutional Militia 
after the Battle of Sipsey Street.<br><br>Or had he?<br><br>"How . . .?"<br><br>Charlie
 smiled. "Will, I've been practicin' my stalkin' skills fer years in the
 Bankhead and up in the Sipsey. You think I couldn't sneak up on a bunch
 of newly minted militiamen?"<br><br>When he thought back on it later, 
Will Shipman recalled that he thought someone was watching him and his 
recruits from the woods that day, but he'd put it down to the ghosts of 
Winston County. But just now, he said, "Well, I reckon you did."<br><br>"You know when you swore all those boys into your new militia?"<br><br>Will nodded.<br><br>"Well,
 I joined too. I repeated your oath, I jest didn't make myself known." 
Charlie Quintard paused. "In all my life," he went on, "no one ever 
treated me as fairly or as kindly as Phil Gordon. I learned more about 
truth an' honor an' principle from him than I did my own daddy. He was 
as decent a human being as I ever knew an' if the ATF killed him, it 
wasn't because of anything he deserved to get. Since then, I've had two 
encounters with those godless heathens. They're thieves, murderers and 
dog-killers. Whatever Phil gave them, they deserved it. An' I know the 
ones that I got deserved it too."<br><br>When he talked of Phil Gordon, 
Charlie's face was soft. When he finished talking about the ATF his 
flinty visage looked like iron beaten in a forge.<br><br>Something occured to Will. "Thieves? What did they steal?"<br><br>Charlie had left that part out. He told Will about Carmichael and the medicine bag and Henderson and the hunting knife.<br><br>When Charlie got to the part about Henderson, Will blurted out, "You did WHAT?"<br><br>"I
 said," Charlie explained patiently, "I put his hand in a vise an' threw
 him in after his dead buddies. My granddaddy did that to a Oxnard who 
stole his mule back in the Thirties. He got the mule back at gunpoint 
an' took the thief to our family's water-powered forge down by the old 
river bed -- this was before the dam backed up the lake. Anyway he had 
an old vise he wasn't using an' after he tied the man's hands together 
he put his right hand in the vise an' crushed it tight. The Oxnard's 
always were no account, he said, an' his cousin was the Sheriff back 
then so turnin' him in was a waste of time. An' then he tossed him in 
the river and tole him to swim. Went down like a boat anchor." Charlie 
paused.<br><br>"So did Henderson, screamin' an' hollerin'. He'd been 
bragging to his buddies while they tore my place apart about how he'd 
been there when they killed Phil Gordon. I figured he had it comin' 
after I saw him steal my knife. I asked granddaddy once before he died 
why he didn't he just hang Oxnard like most folks did horsethieves, an' 
he tole me, 'I didn't have a long enough rope an' he wasn't worth the 
powder.'"<br><br>Charlie paused, half-smiling. "I guess that's what 
happened to me the second time. I didn't have another vise for 
Carmichael so I jest strapped him in the Suburban. Like my granddaddy, I
 used what I had. Improvise, adapt an' overcome."<br><br>Will thought 
about that for a while, as Charlie emptied the water pitcher and waited.
 He did not want Charlie for an enemy, that was for sure and certain. 
But he was going to be a dangerous friend too. He could see that 
plainly. Not for so much as anything Charlie might do to him, but more 
for what Charlie's enemies might do to them both. And he saw that 
Charlie's enemies, who had been Phil Gordon's enemies before that, were 
his enemies now too.<br><br>Well, I talked big for a lot of years about 
"drawin' lines in the dirt" and now that one's been drawn, I can't 
exactly back down, now can I? Not and look myself in the mirror. 
Explaining that to Mary would be another thing. Thank God she was at 
Susie's house helping with the new grandbaby.<br><br>But there comes a 
time in every guerrilla's life when he must choose between fire and 
maneuver and escape and evade. For now he would help Charlie escape and 
evade, because he knew he would need him when it came time to fire and 
maneuver. Charlie Quintard could also help train his people to become 
stalkers and killers. And we're going to need more stalkers and killers 
before this is over.<br><br>"Charlie," Will said, "welcome to the Free 
State Constitutional Militia. I accept your enlistment. Now, let's get 
my pickup truck and go move your larder before tomorrow morning."<br><br>Charlie smiled, and stood up. "Can I use your restroom, Will? That water went clean through me."<br><br>"Sure thing," said Will, "first door on the left down the hall."<br><br>As he watched the Indian leave the kitchen, Will Shipman shook his head in disbelief.<br><br>Puttin' a thief's hand in a VISE and droppin' him in a river.<br><br>Damn.<br><br>I mean, damn.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>It
 was coming up dawn before they finished moving the larder and both men 
were beyond weary. "I'm too old for this crap, Charlie," Will said at 
one point after they'd humped the last of the five gallon buckets up to 
the cave.<br><br>During a break, Charlie had showed him his plunder in 
the two 55 gallon barrels. Will couldn't believe it. What a haul. And 
this was no gun collection that had been purchased over time, nor some 
government shipment gone astray. These were all battle trophies, taken 
in single combat.<br><br>Will Shipman had been a soldier and he had killed people in combat. That was one thing.<br><br>Charlie, well...Charlie was a warrior. And Will knew the difference.<br><br>"Charlie,"
 Will said after he'd caught his breath, "I'm going to want your help 
trainin' my people after this blows over. Stalkin', trackin', edged 
weapons, close quarters combat."<br><br>"Yeah," said Charlie, "I can do that."<br><br>"But I want you to learn something too, for me."<br><br>"Uh, OK, what?" Charlie was puzzled.<br><br>Will
 shifted the lid off the first drum and pulled out a weapon he'd seen 
earlier. After pulling the magazine and racking the bolt, he safed the 
weapon and said, "Tell me about this."<br><br>"Oh, well, that belonged 
to one of them meth heads. It fires real quiet. I know because he tried 
to kill me with it. Couldn't hit the broadside of a barn, though." 
Charlie gave his signature half-grin and then volunteered, "It ain't 
really silent cause it makes a clackin' sound. But it's real quiet 
compared to a regular gun."<br><br>"So this can does work," Will 
replied. "You can't really tell by lookin' at 'em, you've got to try it.
 There's lots of fake suppressors out there. But I'll take your word for
 it." Will shifted the weapon back into the glare of the electric 
lantern they were using.<br><br>"Charlie, this is an Ingram MAC-10 
submachinegun. It fires .45 caliber rounds out of a 30-round magazine, 
from an open bolt. This is the selector switch. This is safe, this is 
semi-auto and this is full auto. The feller who was shootin' at you was 
probably using full auto, and he probably didn't use the fold-out stock,
 did he?"<br><br>"That's just like I picked it up off the ground," Charlie replied. "Had to clean a little blood off it though."<br><br>"Well,
 the stock folds out like this, see?" Will manipulated the mechanism. 
"And this little strap hanging down from the front you use to pull the 
muzzle down when you fire. Like this." Will mounted the weapon to his 
shoulder and showed Charlie the proper hold and stance, leaning into the
 shot with his left foot forward.<br><br>"Are you right handed?"<br><br>"Yeah," said Charlie.<br><br>"OK, do what I just did and hold it up like you're going to fire at somebody."<br><br>Charlie complied, and Will corrected his stance and hold. "More like that, Charlie. Got it?"<br><br>"I guess, but I'm a lot better with a bow."<br><br>"I know, but sometimes only a firearm will do. You see that don't you?"<br><br>"Yeah, I guess, but how do I practice with it up here?"<br><br>"How
 far back does this cave go, after you get past that big rock?" Will 
flashed his own combat light back into the opening behind them.<br><br>"Well,
 about, I don't know, twenty-five yards or so. You can stand up in it 
for about ten of those where it gets straight following a fissure in the
 layer. If you're thinking of me shootin' back there, I'd rather not."<br><br>Will
 thought for a moment, about noise and powdersmoke and breathing the 
already fetid air of the cave. Probably wouldn't be good to give away 
his position anyway. Lord knows what technology they were going to bring
 to bear to find him up here.<br><br>"All right. Look. For now let's 
just say that you learn how to take it apart, clean it and dry-fire it. 
Do you have any more magazines for this?"<br><br>"Sure," said Charlie 
and rooted around in the barrel, clanking and banging until he pulled 
out an old GI ammo pouch with a shoulder strap containing five other 
thirty rounders. "Here."<br><br>Will examined them one at time. Three were loaded. Two were rusty.<br><br>"Look,
 Charlie, the other thing we're going to have to do is preserve this 
stuff from rusting." Will thought. "But now is not the time."<br><br>Daylight was coming fast and the truck had to be out of here. Will put the lid back in place on the drum.<br><br>"OK, we've got everything you need right?"<br><br>"Yeah, I can get by on this. But I'm low on candles and matches."<br><br>"All
 right. Don't under any circumstances go back to the cabin. You know the
 cache points we talked about. I'll see that you get some candles and 
some other things you need at the first one by tomorrow night. It's the 
closest and you don't want to be moving around much for a while. I'll 
also get you a means to communicate with me if you need me. Anything 
else?"<br><br>"No," said Charlie slowly, "Just thanks."<br><br>"Charlie,
 I never got a chance to help Phil. I know he'd approve of me helpin' 
you. But what I really think is that we're gonna be helpin' each other 
thru this shitstorm that's about to hit."<br><br>Charlie, thinking on the ten dead agents and Pushmataha, asked plaintively, "You mean it ain't hit yet?"<br><br>Will, realizing what Charlie had been through, shook his head, "Believe me, we ain't seen nothin' yet."<br><br>The two men shook hands.<br><br>"The supplies will be there. Keep safe."<br><br>Charlie said, "I will," not really believing "safe" was possible.<br><br>Will Shipman turned and disappeared out the mouth of the cave into the coming day.<br><br>Charlie
 was too exhausted to arrange anything now. He picked out a flat spot on
 the cave floor and selected two of his thickest blankets and rolled 
them out. Then he pulled out his sleeping bag and unrolled it over top 
of them. He took off his boots and slipped on some leather mocassins 
he'd made last winter. Then he slipped into the bag, using another 
blanket for a pillow.<br><br>His last thought before he drifted off was of how much he missed the faithful Pushmataha.<br><br>In his dreams, the dog licked his face, and Charlie smiled.</p>

							<p>I can almost feel like I am actually in the situations in this novel.<br><br>Just
 a question though for Mike: Which Civil War are we talking about here 
in the first paragraph? The one against Northern Aggression or the one 
for Restoration?</p>

							<p>...ahhhh, Pushmataha....  Faithful dog that visits in the
