 doctrine that a state, in the exercise of its sovereignty, may reject a
 mandate of the federal government deemed to be unconstitutional or to 
exceed the powers delegated to the federal government.  The concept is 
based on the 10th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States 
reserving to the states powers not delegated to the United States. 
Historically, the doctrine emanated from Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dallas 
419, wherein the state of Georgia, when sued in the Supreme Court by a 
private citizen of another state, entered a remonstrance and declined to
 recognize the court's jurisdiction. Amendment 11 validated Georgia's 
position.  Implementation of the doctrine may be peaceable, as by 
resolution, remonstrance or legislation, or may proceed ultimately to 
nullification with forcible resistance.”   --  </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Black's Law Dictionary</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“We Dare Defend Our Rights”</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“The
 Constitution is not an instrument for government to restrain the

 a just man and one with a firm grasp of his intentions, neither the 
heated passions of his fellow-citizens ordaining something awful, nor 
the face of a tyrant before his very eyes, will shake him in his 
firm-based mind.”)   -- </span>Horace, 65BC – 8 BC<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"A Just Man":  The Governor, One Year and Three Months After the Battle of Sipsey Street</span><br><br>The
 last time that Ray Marsh had stood up for an unpopular principle, it 
had cost him his job.  This time he knew it would probably cost him his 
freedom and it might well cost him his life if he resisted, which he 
certainly intended to.<br><br>Still, that was a trade he was willing to 
make, for he was that kind of man.  What pained him was the sure and 
certain knowledge that a whole lot of other folks might die because of 
the decision he was about to take.  He hadn’t felt this burden since he 
had been a young Captain of infantry 40 years ago and a half a world 
away.  This time a whole lot more people stood to lose their lives, and 
the battle would be fought at home, in his beloved Alabama, in his 
people’s front yards, in his hometown’s streets, and many innocents 
would surely die.<br><br>The state motto was “We Dare Defend Our Rights.”  Ray wondered how many of his fellow citizens besides him believed it.<br><br>They were going to find out.<br><br>“Take this cup from my lips, Oh Lord,” he breathed almost inaudibly.  “Show me some other way, if it is Your will.”<br><br>Ray
 Marsh believed in God.  His God was the God of Abraham and Isaac, of 
Joshua and David, and, not coincidentally, of the Founders of his 
country.  His God had sent His only Son to die upon a cross two 
millennia ago to take upon Himself the sins of all men.  His was a Son 
who had said, “If a house be divided against itself, that house cannot 
stand.”  He was a Son who would one day return to finally vanquish all 
evil and to lay judgment upon the world.<br><br>Ray Marsh did not fear 
dying. No man of true faith does.  If there was one thing he did fear, 
it was that he would be judged and found wanting by his God.  And so he 
prayed, there, on his knees on the carpet in the Governor’s office, and 
begged God one more time to give him wisdom, to show him the way in 
which God wanted him to walk.<br><br>He was still praying when his chief of staff came into the room quietly and said softly, “It’s time, Governor.”<br><br>Ray sighed, concluded his prayer, rose and turned to face the younger man.<br><br>“OK, Jamie,” the governor of the sovereign state of Alabama replied.  “Let’s go do our duty.  May God guide us this day.”<br><br>“Yes, sir,” replied Jamie Frost, fearing what came next.<br><br>Placing
 his hand briefly on Jamie’s shoulder in reassurance, Ray Marsh walked 
out of his office on his way to start another American War Between the 
States.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The 3 Percent: "If the cause is right, we will never retreat."</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“America
 has once again arrived at a momentous crossroads.  We are going to have
 to decide—as we have had to decide so many times in the past—whether we
 shall only speak of justice and speak of principle, or whether we shall
 stand and fight for them.”  -- </span>Alan Keyes, 2000.<b><br><br></b><span style="font-style: italic;">“Unfortunately,
 while nearly all modern historians agree on the initiating event of the
 constitutional crisis variously called the Constitution War, the Second
 American Civil War or the War of Restoration, scholarly opinion is 
deeply divided on the underlying causes.  At least three-fourths of the 
scholarship on this topic is fundamentally skewed by the political 
opinions of the authors, or that of the audience for which the books are
 written.  In addition, historical time lines and factual narratives are
 incomplete and disputed by both sides.  This “factual void” came about 
for four principal reasons.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First,
 several of the surviving key participants on both sides of the conflict
 failed to leave reliable memoirs.  Second, many key state records were 
lost in the Federal attacks on Montgomery and Birmingham.  Third, many 
Federal records were lost in EMP attacks carried out by the Alabama 
Constitutionalists and independent formations allied with them.  Fourth,
 the technological ability to digitally create “news footage” to suit 
propaganda war needs, and the documented use of what has come to be 
called “disinformation warfare” by the Federal side in that conflict, 
calls into question even the most elemental military and political 
aspects of the crisis.  Some skirmishes, assassinations and sabotage 
reported as fact on the evening news seem never to have taken place at 
all, and the reporting of many other such incidents was often “doctored”
 to spin the Federal side into a more positive light for public 
consumption.  Such inventions of fact make the writing of reliable 
history hazardous at best….</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Perhaps
 the most succinct explanation of the conflict was offered by an aged 
veteran of the Alabama State Defense Force interviewed by the oral 
historian William Granger in May, 2044.  Then in his nineties, retired 
Sergeant Major Ford “Skip” Munson, said “The Feds had been pushing us 
away from our God-given liberties for seventy years.  They finally 
pushed us into a corner, and we pushed back.”  -- </span>The Encyclopedia Americana,  Tri-Centennial Edition, 2076.<br><b><br></b>The
 results of the presidential election made a constitutional crisis 
inevitable, although whether it would have happened as early as it did 
without the confluence of events represented by the Battle of Sipsey 
Street and the earlier election of Ray Marsh as Governor of the state of
 Alabama is still the subject of historical debate.  Even prior to both 
events, many felt that it wasn’t so much that the country was divided, 
as it was two entirely different countries within one border.<br><br>Oh,
 Americans shared the same language and the same cultural heritage and 
history.  They lived in the same neighborhoods, talked to each other at 
work and carried their kids to the same football games or soccer 
practices.  But by the Battle of Sipsey Street, language and proximity 
was about all they shared.  Each side viewed reality from a 
fundamentally different perspective.<br><br>Worse, there was a sharp 
divide over what kind of nation and government would inherit the 21st 
Century.  The Democrats felt that the results of the previous 
presidential election had settled the matter and they proceeded to 
remake the country in their image.<br><br>Arguments over philosophy rarely end in bloodshed.<br><br>Arguments over power often do.<br><br>And
 as Abraham Lincoln quoted from the book of Mark: “If a house be divided
 against itself, that house cannot stand.”  Lincoln was speaking of the 
divide over slavery, yet the divisions in American society at the 
opening of the 21st Century were just as deep, if not deeper, as those 
in 1860.<br><br>By the time of the Battle of Sipsey Street, these divisions were leading to the same sort of bloody argument.<br><br>One
 side believed that the Constitution was a “living” document and could 
be changed to suit “modern circumstances.”  Consequently, things such 
abortion, gun control and homosexual marriage were perfectly 
constitutional if a majority of Supreme Court justices said they were.  
This side viewed government power as the solution to most, if not all, 
problems, and woe betide anyone who disagreed with paying the taxes 
necessary to achieve their noble goals.  These Americans (called 
“liberals” by their opponents but self-described as “progressives”) were
 collectivist and even socialist in their economic beliefs and secular 
humanist in their philosophy.  The movers and shakers of this half of 
America believed in the supremacy of “enlightened” man over “out-dated” 
laws and “old-fashioned” religious beliefs.  More importantly, they 
believed the federal government had both the right and the duty to 
implement their vision of America.  Their critics derisively referred to
 them as “the anointed” and that wasn’t far from the truth.<br><br>The 
anointed believed that God, if He existed at all, was welcome to His 
place in Heaven, if that existed, as long as no one on earth in their 
temporal kingdom took Him or His commandments too seriously.   Man, not 
God, ought to govern affairs down here on earth, or so said the 
anointed.  And if someone, anyone, was made uncomfortable by the public 
display of the Ten Commandments or prayer in school (or anywhere else 
for that matter), then such displays or prayers must be forbidden to 
all.  They believed in tolerance, these anointed elites, unless it was 
tolerance for anything with which they disagreed.<br><br>Pornography?  No problem.<br><br>Drugs?  No problem.<br><br>Corruption of public officials (at least those who belonged to their own party)?  Expected.<br><br>Devil worshipping chaplains in the US Army?  Certainly.<br><br>Abortion?  Of course.<br><br>Sexual profligacy?  Encouraged.<br><br>Homosexuality?  Naturally.<br><br>Pedophilia,
 necrophilia, and any other kind of philia?  Well, they might swallow 
nervously, but, yes, who were they to question anyone's morality or 
presume to tell them how to live?  Who indeed?<br><br>Not that the 
anointed didn't insist on telling others how to live.  They specialized 
in it.  It was just that there were two standards.  One for those with 
whom they agreed, and another for all the rest.<br><br>The other side 
held an older vision of what America had been and should be.  For one 
thing, they believed in the rule of law: for everyone, applied equally, 
without fear or favor.  To them, the Constitution was a fundamentally 
sound document as written by Founders who, having experienced oppression
 themselves, knew exactly what they doing when they limited the central 
government’s powers in the Bill of Rights.  They believed that modifying
 or adding to the original system of the Founders should never be done 
lightly and that those who called it a “living” document because they 
wanted to be rid of one inconvenient restriction or another merely 
wanted it dead.   They also believed that all true law, sometimes called
 natural law, was derived from God, and that the Constitution merely 
codified that which God had ordained.<br><br>They believed in God, this 
half of America, and it was the God of Abraham and Isaac, of Moses and 
David.  They didn’t think that God was dead or irrelevant as many of 
their opponents did.  They believed that almost 50 million abortions was
 state-sanctioned mass murder that put the German Nazis to shame.  They 
believed that the Old and New Testaments were pretty explicit that 
homosexuality was an abomination, and they were universally certain that
 the federal government didn’t have the right to prohibit either their 
public prayers or the display of the Ten Commandments.  Nor, come to 
that, could it lawfully demand that their sons’ Boy Scout troop leader 
be a member of the North American Man-Boy Love Association.  They were 
also certain that if you spit in God’s eye long enough, God spits back, 
and when He does, civilizations fall, governments topple, entire peoples
 are enslaved and cities disappear in the fiery blink of an eye.<br><br>They
 believed that the Second Amendment meant exactly what the Founders 
intended it to say: that "the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
shall not be infringed."  They were a praying people, these Americans, 
and they went to church or synagogue.  And if many of them weren’t 
exactly regular attendees, they at least recognized where they were 
supposed to be on the Sabbath, whatever day of the week they believed it
 to be.  But, almost universally, they prayed for God’s guidance and for
 the deliverance of their society from a tidal wave of obscenity, 
pornography, venality and sin.  They prayed that their children could 
grow up in country better than that they had grown up in, not worse.<br><br>Some
 of these people called themselves “conservatives”; their opponents 
variously called them “right wingers”, “gun nuts” and “religious 
fanatics”.  But most of them didn’t think of themselves as one label or 
another, merely as plain old Americans.  They resented the identity 
politics of their opponents, where one minority group or another got 
special consideration from the government.  They were suspicious of 
anyone who considered themselves a “hyphenated American”.<br><br>Weren’t we all Americans?<br><br>Hadn’t we all come from somewhere else and struggled to make the country’s promise our own by hard work and sacrifice?<br><br>Why should one group or another be considered more worthy than any other?<br><br>To
 them, the argument over whether the society should treat all men and 
women “not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character” had been long settled.  To the more religious among them, not
 only was God colorblind but He required them to be as well.<br><br>Oh, 
they recognized that according to the Constitution and common sense, the
 government had no business trying to keep someone from privately 
sinning.  But they resented it deeply when sin became public policy, 
when they were daily reminded of it in the media and by government 
directive, when their kids were immersed in it at school and on 
television.  They recognized that the leaders and citizenry of the 
country were no longer bound by any moral standard whatsoever, and it 
frightened and angered them.  What were their children to inherit?  21st
 Century America certainly bore little resemblance to the country they 
had been born into.<br><br>And out of this mix of religious belief, 
sense of loss and outrage, came the certainty that someone, someday, 
would have to do something about it.<br><br>And one day, almost by accident, Phil Gordon did.<br><br>To
 those on both sides who had been paying attention, this came as no 
surprise.  Even the liberal columnist E.J. Dionne, Jr. wrote with great 
prescience in late August, 2004:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“Because
 the 2000 election was so close, the idea of an American deeply divided 
by region seemed entirely natural.  We certainly are polarized 
politically.  There are Americans who love George W. Bush and Americans 
who despise him.  However this year’s voting turns out, something close 
to half of us will be furious if not seditious come the morning after 
election day.”</span><br><br>A wordsmith by trade, Dionne knew exactly 
what “seditious” meant when he wrote it.  He may not have understood how
 right he was at the time but events were to prove he had 20-20 
foresight.  Yet, when the break came, no one was more astounded than the
 liberal elites that Dionne wrote for.<br><br>Said one Alabama militiaman at the time:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Liberals
 have no deeply-held principles that they will not compromise if pushed,
 so they don't understand people who will fight and die rather than 
compromise.  I guess that's what made the war inevitable.  We'd been 
warning 'em for years, but they never thought we'd put our lives on the 
line just because they never had the guts to.  They figured that if the 
federal government told us to do somethin' then, by God, we'd have to 
give in, whereas we knew that when push came to shove, we, by God, would
 NEVER give in...that they'd have to kill us first.  And you know what? 
 A man who's willing to die for his country is 99 times out of 100 a man
 who will kill for it too.  And THAT was a part of the equation those 
pointy-headed liberals never counted on."</span><br><br>The culture and 
philosophy of the rebels of Phil Gordon's stripe, like many of their 
individual bloodlines, was Scots-Irish.  It traced its lineage from 
highland freedom fighters like William Wallace and the hard-headed 
Scotch Covenanters through generations of Irish revolutionaries, across 
the pitiless Atlantic to these shores.  James Webb, Secretary of the 
Navy in the Reagan administration and later, ironically,  Democrat U.S. 
Senator from Virginia, wrote this of the Scots-Irish in 2004,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"They
 tamed the wilderness, building simple log cabins and scraping corn 
patches in thin soil.  And they pressed onward, creating a way of life 
that many would call, if not American, certainly the defining fabric of 
the South and Midwest, as well as the core character of the nation's 
working class... They came with nothing, and, for a complicated set of 
reasons, many of them still have nothing.... These people are too often 
misconstrued and ignored when America's history is told.  They did great
 things.  And in truth, the Scots-Irish. . .are a force that still 
shapes our culture.  The Scots-Irish brought with them a strong, 
bottom-up individualism. . . Their unique soldierly traditions formed 
the backbone of the country's military, particularly in the Army and 
Marine Corps....</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The 
traditional Scots-Irish culture, like America itself, is a study in wild
 contrasts.  These are an intensely religious people-- indeed, they 
comprise the very heart of the Christian evangelical movement-- and yet 
they are also unapologetically and even devilishly hedonistic.  They are
 probably the most anti-authoritarian culture in America, conditioned 
from birth to resist,"</span> said Webb, noting that even Rosa Parks, 
whose refusal to go to the back of the bus sparked the modern civil 
rights movement, spoke with pride of her Scots-Irish great-grandfather.<br><br>Despite this anti-authoritarianism, continued Webb,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"they
 are known as the most intensely patriotic segment of the country as 
well.  They are naturally rebellious, often impossible to control, and 
yet their strong military tradition produces generation after generation
 of perhaps the finest soldiers the world has ever seen.  They are 
filled with wanderlust, but no matter how far they roam, their passion 
for family travels with them.  Underlying these seeming contradictions 
is a strong unwritten code of personal honor and individual 
accountability."</span><br><br>Independence.<br><br>Honor.<br><br>Family.<br><br>Personal responsibility.<br><br>God.<br><br>On
 all of these tenets of the Scots-Irish faith, the new administration 
was bound to fail to live up to the standards of these traditional 
Americans, and fail it did.   There were too many campaign debts owed to
 the left-liberals of the Democrat party for it to be any different.   
From the moment the new president took over, by fiat and judicial 
appointment the administration began to violate every one of the 
Scots-Irish's most cherished beliefs, systematically intruding the 
federal government into their personal lives.<br><br>It began with guns,
 just as it had in the Clinton Administration.  The alphabet agencies 
were packed with bureaucrats whose first reflexive actions on November 
3rd were designed to curry favor with the incoming bosses.<br><br>Just 
as the ATF had sought to please the anti-gun Clintons by carrying out 
the Waco raid, the agency dusted off plans and operations that had been 
shelved since January, 2001.  Out of this eargerness to please their new
 masters came the raid on Phil Gordon and the Battle of Sipsey Street.<br><br>It
 did not help that the judicial appointments of the new administration 
to the federal courts (and the decisions which those justices wrote) 
were fantastically unpopular with the citizens who later participated in
 the rebellion.  The 5-4 decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Barney vs. Boy Scouts of America</span>
 which mandated that the Scouts include homosexuals and even pedophiles 
as scoutmasters along the Canadian model resulted in the destruction of 
that historic youth group.  And the formation of alternative youth 
organizations such as the Christian Scouts of America and the Jewish 
Scouts of America hastened the process of polarization in the society 
into religious and non-religious camps.<br><br>The new liberal tilt of 
the Supremes was felt in decisions on everything from property rights to
 guns to free speech.  The Court's application of the so-called 
"fairness doctrine" to radio and television just about killed commercial
 conservative talk radio.  The removal of this important means of 
sharing information and venting opinions against the new regime caused 
great frustration.  The people began to believe that someone was trying 
to silence their complaints and worse, that there was no redress 
possible in the courts or the political process.  It was natural that 
some folks concluded that the only thing that they could do to defend 
their rights was to clean their guns and be ready to use them.<br><br>A 
new word began cropping up in conservative circles to describe their 
opponents: "anti-constitutional."  The right had described the 
Clintonista measures of the decade before as "unconstitutional".  
Somehow that did not seem a strong enough word to describe what was 
really going on in the new administration, and "anti-constitutional" was
 perhaps a more accurate description.<br><br>And just as the government 
got more oppressive, the culture war continued to escalate.  But now the
 body count was starting to hit closer to home for conservatives. A 
satanist rock band, Dark Prince, cut an album entitled "Worshiping the 
Master."  The title track suggested that the best way to honor Beelzebub
 was to start stacking up bodies of their enemies, the Christian 
faithful.  On April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine school massacre
 and Adolf Hitler's birthday, 18 year old Alex Benjamin, a satanist and 
Dark Prince fan, shot his way into a Baptist sunday school building in 
Centerpoint, Alabama.  Before he was in turn shot dead by a churchgoer 
who never went anywhere without his pocket pistol, Benjamin killed 3 
adults and 12 children, ages six to thirteen.  He died with a smile on 
his face.<br><br>Benjamin became a folk anti-hero in some quarters and 
over the next six months copy cat massacres spread across fourteen 
states.  In California, a yeshiva was targeted by a self-proclaimed 
Odinist.  This specimen of twisted humanity claimed in a note found 
after the attack that he killed his victims in the sincere hope that if 
enough bodies were stacked up, the gates of Vahalla would spring open 
and Odin and all his other Norse biker-god buddies would come roaring 
back out onto the earth to reign in blood and terror.  Thirty-seven 
people, mostly children, died in the yeshiva attack.  On the door was 
posted a sign in bold letters: "Absolutely no firearms allowed."  When 
he ran out of victims, the Odinist killed himself.<br><br>After that, 
the Jewish Defense League began to experience a resurgence, not only in 
California, but all over the country.  Christian volunteers also began 
providing armed security for their own church properties and, in four 
cases, would-be mass murderers were killed in the parking lot before 
they could strike down innocents at worship, thus getting to meet the 
Devil a little earlier than they had planned.   A website devoted to the
 fad carried this advice to the satanist faithful: "Don't target the 
Catholics, Baptists, Methodists or Presbyterians.  They're more likely 
to pack when they pray.  Hit the Unitarian-Universalists, they believe 
in gun control."<br><br>To the Scots-Irish, especially the Christians 
among them, it seemed as if the world were turned upside down.  Robert 
Thomas Barry, an oil-patch worker from Hobbs, New Mexico, put it this 
way:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"You know, this is worse 
than 1860.  A Tidewater cotton planter and a cod-eating New Hampshire 
Yankee had more in common with each other than we do with our own 
countrymen today. They prayed to the same God, believed in the same rule
 of law, and shared the same heritage.  The only thing they disagreed 
about was slavery.  Now that's a pretty big thing, but at least they 
considered each other to be countrymen.  These people?  Why these people
 are the enemy.... They are the antithesis of everything we believe in. 
 God, private property, morals everything.  It scares me   I don’t know 
these people.  I don’t understand these people.  They are aliens.  Its 
like the invasion of the body snatchers.  They look like us.  They talk 
like us.  But they are NOT us!  Do you realize that I have no reasonable
 expectation that the basic concept of my house is my house and yours is
 yours is respected?  I have no reasonable expectation that my 
daughter's chastity is of any interest to them.  I have no reasonable 
expectation that THEIR OWN daughters' chastity is of any interest to 
them.  And if I'm so rude as to point this fact out to them, they have 
no idea what I'm talking about.  I could be talking in Urdu.  The bottom
 line is, we’re God-fearing, life-loving, freedom-cherishing responsible
  people, and they ain’t.  And you know what?  As time goes by, we get 
fewer and they get more numerous."</span><br><br>For the devout 
tradition-loving people of the country who increasingly felt like a 
despised minority in their own homeland, the new administration looked 
like the local representatives of the Devil himself.<br><br>As the 
months rolled by, and the country grew more chaotic and yet less free, 
some of them came to a conclusion: this can't go on much longer.  
History, they knew, is made by determined minorities.  For good or ill, 
majorities coalesce around the few who have the will to resist the tides
 of the history and the strength to swim upstream dragging the rest of 
the society with them.<br><br>During the American Revolution, for 
example, one third of the colonists were against British rule, one third
 were for it, and the final third blew with the wind, willing to take 
whatever came.  Indeed, there were more colonists who served in the 
military forces of the Crown than served under Washington.  In the end, 
the Revolution was accomplished by less than 3 percent of the population
 fighting as combatants, actively  supported by a mere 10 percent of 
their countrymen.<br><br>Just 3 percent to fight the greatest military power then in the world.<br><br>3 percent.<br><br>And they won.<br><br>When James Webb wrote these words in 2004, he, like Dionne, was more right than he knew:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
 Scots-Irish are a fiercely independent individualist people.  It goes 
against their grain to think collectively.  But, as America rushes 
forward into yet another redefinition of itself, the contributions of 
the Scots-Irish are too great to remain invisible.  My culture needs to 
reclaim itself-- stop letting others define, mock and even use it.  
Because our country needs us.  We are the molten core at the very center
 of its unbridled, raw, rebellious spirit.  We helped build this nation 
from the bottom up.  We face the world on our feet and not on our knees.
  We were born fighting.  And if the cause is right, we will never 
retreat."</span><br><br>However cognitively dissonant he was in hitching
 his political wagon to the collectivist Democrat party who largely 
despised the traditions of the Scotch-Irish, beginning with the Battle 
of Sipsey Street, Webb's prediction unfolded with swift and startling 
prescience.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Old Dog": 3 weeks after the Battle of Sipsey Street</span><br><br>Office of the Governor of the State of Alabama<br>10:00 AM Central<br><br>The
 men and women filed into the office gravely, somberly.  The subject of 
this meeting was Phil Gordon, the Battle of Sipsey Street, more than a 
hundred dead federal agents on Alabama soil, and what the state of 
Alabama was going to do about it, if anything.<br><br>The Governor 
looked out the window, lost in thought as the members of his new 
administration took their seats.  As the last invited attendee came 
through the double doors, the Director of the Department of Public 
Safety leaped to his feet and strode across the carpet to clap him on 
the shoulder and shake his hand.<br><br>"Jack, you old dog, howinhell ya been?"<br><br>Jack
 Durer, pushing 70 and still the tallest, if grayest haired, man in the 
room, returned the greeting warmly in his booming bass voice:<br><br>"Hell, Billy, I rode in here on my Harley from Chilton County.  I guess that counts for something."<br><br>The exchange drew the Governor out of his reverie.  He pivoted his chair to face his staff directly.  He nodded at Durer.<br><br>"Jack, thank you for coming.  Billy tells me you have a lot to contribute to our understanding of the overall picture."<br><br>Now seated, Jack Durer nodded, "Yes, sir, I believe I do."<br><br>"All, right.  Billy, what do we know about what really happened at Sipsey Street?"<br><br>The
 DPS director began his briefing.  The Governor had heard most of it in 
dribs and drabs over the past three weeks, but it was many in the room's
 first time to hear the story.<br><br>It wasn't pretty.<br><br>From 
confidential sources in the public and private sectors, DPS had 
determined that Gordon had probably not deserved the attentions of the 
feds.  It seemed that he had not crossed the line into illegality until 
after he learned he was being targeted by the ATF, and in that he had 
only (only!) broken the laws on the use of explosives.  He had his 
blaster's license, after all, so mere possession was not illegal.  The 
firearms he had used were all semi-automatic so the allegation by the 
ATF of automatic weapons possession was bogus as near as anyone could 
reconstruct from the wreckage left by the explosion of Gordon's gun 
safe.  The ATF had apparently picked on Gordon because they didn't like 
him running his mouth, writing letters to the editor and politicians 
about ATF abuses.  Only they'd finally picked the wrong victim.  Of 
course the ATF was saying he was the greatest madman mass murderer of 
all time, but that was true only if Gordon hadn't been acting in self 
defense.<br><br>"So," the Governor said when Billy Mitchell finished, "was it self defense?"<br><br>The DPS director looked up from his notes.<br><br>"Governor,
 the Attorney General can probably speak to that subject 
professionally," the director nodded toward dark-skinned AG across the 
room, "but I'd say that if he had lived, and his defense had access to 
the information we've uncovered, his lawyer could make a damned good 
case it was self-defense."<br><br>The AG nodded in agreement.<br><br>Mitchell continued, "But sir, Jack here knew Phil Gordon personally.  I'd like you to hear his opinion."<br><br>The Governor turned to Jack Durer.<br><br>"What can you tell me?"<br><br>Billy
 Mitchell interrupted.  "Governor, I know there's a lot of folks here 
who probably don't know Jack or his history of service to Alabama."<br><br>He paused, and the Governor nodded his assent.<br><br>"Jack
 Durer retired a few years ago after serving in DPS from the Wallace to 
the James administrations.  He ran the Intelligence unit of the Alabama 
Bureau of Investigation for many years and he's kept up his sources of 
information since then.  There's more than a couple crooked politicians 
in this state who are out of office or behind bars because of Jack's 
work -- and that's AFTER he retired.  If there's something going on in 
the state that Jack doesn't know about, it's either unimportant or one 
of his informants hasn't checked in yet."<br><br>Jack Durer grinned.  "Thanks, Billy, that's quite a buildup."<br><br>Actually,
 it wasn't close to being half the story.  Oh, Durer had had a long and 
fabled career in the Alabama State Troopers and ABI, to be sure.  But he
 was, as they say, a man of many parts.  Before his career in Alabama 
law enforcement, Jack Durer had served in the 5th Special Forces Group 
in Vietnam, eventually working for, and becoming friends with, the 
legendary Bill Colby of the CIA in the Phoenix Program.  He had 
maintained his contacts in the spook community since then and they had 
often paid him, and the people of the great state of Alabama, great 
dividends in the intervening years.<br><br>Not that the people of the 
state would ever know it.  Jack Durer was also a man who could keep 
secrets, especially his own.  Most of those crooked politicians that 
he'd arranged jail time for never knew his fingerprints were on their 
case files.  They never knew he was coming, what hit them, or that he 
had ever been there in the first place.  He still carried his 5th Group 
coin in his wallet, and had lived its motto, "De Oppresso Liber"  -- "To
 Free the Oppressed."<br><br>Durer lost his smile as he faced the Governor.<br><br>"Sir,
 Phil Gordon was as law-abiding a feller as I ever knew.  We didn't meet
 in Vietnam, but I got to know him, I guess about five or six years 
after we came home, at an Alabama Gun Collectors Association gunshow.  
Phil was a serious gun nut and so am I.  He always despised the ATF for 
Waco and their many more minor sins over the years, but he always obeyed
 their stupid laws and regulations even though he thought they were 
unconstitutional.  I hadn't talked to him for almost a year, right after
 his wife died.  After he was killed I spent a little time running down 
sources that I have within the ATF and FBI.  I've shared some of that, 
but not all, with your director of DPS here," nodding at Billy, "and 
I'll tell you that the ATF did not intend for Phil to survive that raid.
  They wanted his scalp."<br><br>Durer paused.<br><br>"What I believe is
 that Phil Gordon, learning by accident that he had been targeted by the
 ATF for his opinions, decided to teach them a lesson about picking on 
the wrong feller, and by God, he sure did."<br><br>Jack paused again.  "But was it self-defense?  Hell, yes.  No doubt about it."<br><br>Roy Marsh turned to his Attorney General.<br><br>"Robert, what do you conclude?"<br><br>The
 immaculately dressed AG, Alabama's first black man to serve in that 
post and widely expected to succeed Roy Marsh as Governor, replied 
without hesitation.<br><br>"Sir, not only was it self defense, I'd consider bringing murder charges against the ATF agents responsible."<br><br>He paused.<br><br>"If any of them were still alive."<br><br>Jack Durer chuckled, and the room stirred.<br><br>The Governor did not smile.<br><br>"You
 know," speaking to no one in particular, "I went to many of those ATF 
funerals.  I didn't go to Phil Gordon's.  I was advised not to."<br><br>Here, the Governor looked hard at his Chief of Staff.<br><br>"Maybe I should have."<br><br>"Gosh knows there's at least half the state who think you should have," said his press secretary.  "They believe he's a hero."<br><br>"Maybe he was," said the Republican senate minority leader.<br><br>"But you'd better not say so in public," the press secretary shot back.  "You'll end up with a federal tax audit at least."<br><br>Jack
 Durer spoke up.  He hadn't come here to honor Phil Gordon or to bury 
him.  The state was about to come apart and Ray Marsh needed to know it.<br><br>"Sir,
 there's more pressing business because of this, and Phil Gordon's last 
stand is going to look like a Disney World ride if you don't deal with 
it."<br><br>Ray Marsh replied, "Go ahead."<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"De Oppresso Liber"</span><br><br>"Governor,
 Alabama has had a large and active militia movement for almost twenty 
years now.  Most of 'em are real quiet, but they've been training, most 
of 'em, since the '90s.  And ever since the new administration took 
over, they've been growing -- growing BIG, and growing more competent. 
My sources within the movement tell me that its all they can do to 
restrain their members from attacking the feds right now.  And its not 
like they have full control over their troops. They're militia, all 
volunteers, and leading them is like herding cats and chickens at the 
same time, as one of them told me.   There is no Betty Crocker Seal of 
Approval for militias.  There's racists out there, Kluxers and Nazis, 
who have been waiting for something like this.  The responsible leaders 
will help us prevent terrorism if they can, but they want assurances 
that the state is going to do what it can to prevent the ATF from 
attacking them like Phil Gordon.  And if the ATF screws up and attacks 
one of them like they did Phil, they'll ALL react. They've been sitting 
on ready for three weeks.  And not just here, all over the country.  
You've seen the headlines, sir.  Surely you know where this is headed.  
It's going to get bloody.  And with the new laws coming down the pike . .

 Mitchell put in, "I'll tell you this, they're badgering me about it.  
Kraut Mueller's called me twice a day since it happened, "touching base"
 and wanting to know what we're going to do to keep the ATF from doing 
it again."<br><br>The press secretary snorted, "Mueller?  That fat old windbag?  He's all talk."<br><br>Durer's head pivoted like a machine gun traversing until his steely gaze locked in on the PR flack.<br><br>"That, I have reason to know, is incorrect.  Kraut Mueller is a lot more than talk."<br><br>The press secretary tried to hold Durer's eyes and failed, looking down at his feet.<br><br>The
 Governor looked about the room.  Everyone here, save Durer, was part of
 what he called his "kitchen cabinet."  They could be trusted, he 
thought, with what was going to come next without leaking it to the 
press or the feds.<br><br>"Well, Jack," the Governor said mildly, "as it
 happens the Attorney General and I have had some ideas along those 
lines.  Robert, why don't you tell us about the Doctrine of 
Interposition and how it may apply here?"<br><br>The AG smiled broadly,<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>He began, "The Doctrine of Interposition goes back to English common law. . ."<br><br>And
 as they listened to the AG's presentation, they began to see where this
 was headed.  For his part, Jack Durer reached into his back pocket and 
fetched his 5th Group coin from his wallet.  As the Attorney General 
spoke, he idly flipped it over and over in his right hand.<br><br>"De Oppresso Liber."<br><br>As the immaculately-dressed <span style="font-style: italic;">magna cum laude</span> graduate of Harvard Law School concluded his presentation, the "old dog" knew he was going back to war one last time.<br><br>And he smiled.<br><br>Only those who knew him best would have seen the hint of the deep sadness behind it.<b><s><br></s></b></p>

							<p>I read the first chapter David Codrea posted about some time 
ago, then sort of lost track of later chapters.  Read them all in order 
this morning.  It's good stuff if a little preachy.  But I must say you 
had me until this chapter.  It ain't about religion, Mike, and it ain't 
about morality.  At least, not for all of us.  The Bible is a very fine 
guide, and I'm all for Christians following it to the best of their 
ability if that's what they want to do.  But I'm not a Christian.  Or a 
Jew, or any other sort of religious type.  So when your heroes start 
stating their philosophy in terms of what they hate seeing other people 
do, I start wondering how they're fundamentally any more to be preferred
 than the bad guys.<br><br>Just a thought, for what it's worth.</p>

							<p>I have to agree with Joel, here.  I'd be part of your three 
percent, but I'm not sure I'd be welcome.  Institutionalised 
discrimination against homosexuals is nothing more than what you 
described as the government trying to stop people from sinning.<br><br>A
 man marrying another man, or even a man and a woman each, has 
absolutely no deleterious effect upon my marriage to my wife.  I may 
think what they're doing is "icky", but to try and regulate it through 
the iron fist of government is exactly the sort of tactic that the 
leftists use against guns.  And I will not be a part of that.</p>

							<p>Guys:<br><br>- A lot of folks see the world differently than a lot of other folks.<br><br>- Some folks think that their flavor of "different" is superior, and start to impose that on others.<br><br>-
 Some other folks use one or more of a litany of excuses (those people 
are nuts, they're intolerant, there's no chance of success, I don't know
 what to do, there's still the possibility of relief via the political 
system, there's a difference between hunters/sportsmen and the nasty 
right-wing militia nut jobs, etc.) to justify their unwillingness to get
 involved in the fun.<br><br>- Some other folks take the words of Jefferson, Henry, Adams, Lee, Morgan, Jackson, Forrest, and others damned seriously.<br><br>The great thing is that each individual gets to choose what to do, even at this late date.<br><br>"But" is a choice, as well.</p>

							<p>Well written read that leaves you wanting more. Thank you.<br><br>I
 must make one observation, however. The Scots-Irish are not of Highland
 Scot origin but are instead Lowland Scots, as was William Wallace. No 
matter what nomenclature you use be it Scots -Irish, Norther Irish, 
Irish Presbyterians, they are descendants of Lowland Scots.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Iam McFedup</p>
