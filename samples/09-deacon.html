 was back in Korea, cold, scared and mad as hell when somewhere in the 
distance, at the edges of his consciousness, a phone rang. <br><br>Bobby
 Williams, third shift maintenance man at the Crown-Zellerbach paper 
plant, wasn't due to get up for another three hours.  He groaned and 
rolled over, burying his head deeper into the pillow. <br><br>It kept ringing. <br><br>A thought penetrated the haze.  Where was Lucy? <br><br>"Crap," Bobby muttered, and threw the covers back and sat up. <br><br>The phone stopped. <br><br>"Figures," he sighed.<br><br>He
 could hear Lucille talking, her voice rising, but couldn't make out the
 words.  Sitting on the side of the bed in his underwear, he rubbed his 
eyes and then ran his right hand back and forth over the close cropped 
hair on his head, trying to lose the grogginess.  He looked at the clock
 on the nightstand. <br><br>"Crap." <br><br>He'd never get back to sleep now.  Might as well get up. <br><br>As
 he did, his wife threw open the door and blurted out, "Bobby!  Joe 
Baker says those two white boys from CORE is getting beat to death by 
the Klan down in front of Andrey's.  He says meet him at Aunt Sylvie's 
right behind there as soon as you can." <br><br>She paused, and then in fear for her husband moaned aloud, "Oh, Bobby."<br><br>Bobby Williams was awake instantly.  They had planned for this, him and Joe and some of the men from the plant. <br><br>"Get
 my rifle and my clips from the front closet," he ordered and set about 
throwing on his clothes.  They were dirty from the night before, draped 
over the chipped wooden chair in the corner.<br><br>If'n I die in 'em, t'won't matter one way or t'other if they're clean or dirty, he thought.  <br><br>He yelled after his wife through the open door, "And get me a glass of water!" <br><br>Thirsty, he remembered with a tight smile.  Combat always did make me thirsty.<br><br>In
 about as much time as it takes to tell, Bobby Williams met his wife at 
the front door.  His Garand leaned against the doorframe.   Lucy stood 
there, as beautiful as the day he married her despite the two daughters 
she'd borne him and a third child almost here any day now and everything
 else in a hate-filled world gone crazy.  His glass of  of water was in 
her left hand and the bandoleer marked ".30 Caliber M-2 Ball" in her 
right. <br><br>Their eyes met. <br><br>Lord, she had pretty eyes.  It 
was her eyes that first drew him to her, that afternoon at the church 
picnic that seemed like an eternity ago now. At this instant,  tears 
were forming in them.<br><br>Bobby took the glass from her hand, 
tenderly, and gulped down the water.  Then, words failing him, he hugged
 Lucy tight for a long moment, her swollen belly pressing against him.  
He released her, took the bandoleer from her hand and slung it over his 
head so it dangled on his right side. <br><br>Then he grabbed the rifle and ran out the front door. <br><br>Behind him, Lucille Wiliiams began to sob.<br>____<br><br>A
 historian would later write that "the eatery was a tiny matchbox of a 
building, little more than a single room 15 by 15 feet."  But just right
 now, it was a battlefield in a war. <br><br>And the first shots had already been fired.<br><br>Bill
 Yates and Steve Miller were two white activists of the Congress of 
Racial Equality, come to Bogalusa that day to meet with local black 
labor officials down at the Negro Union Hall.  When they left the Hall 
to drive back to New Orleans in Miller's car, they noticed a shadowing 
vehicle full of white guys.  As it happened, and it was no coincidence, 
the car held five stalwarts of the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
  They were there to teach these two "nigger lovers" a lesson about 
meddling in things that weren't any concern of theirs.<br><br>The two 
unarmed civil rights activists, knowing that if they continued on out of
 town along the narrow two-lane highway that ran between Bogalusa and 
New Orleans they would be easy pickings, pulled into Andrey's to use the
 pay phone to call for help. <br><br>Yates, the older man, leaped out of
 the car and hit the ground running, making for the front door.  The 
Klan vehicle pulled in front of Miller's blocking the path.  Shots rang 
out, though no one was hit, and one of the Kluxers threw brick at 
Miller's car. <br><br>The Klansmen leaped out and ran down Yates before 
he could get inside the cafe.  Throwing him to the ground, they began to
 dance on him a bit.  The Kluxers toyed with him, giving him a broken 
hand and severe internal injuries, before he escaped and staggered into 
the front door of Andrey's.  Miller backed his car out of the roadblock 
and then on around the back of the cafe, parked it and joined his 
injured friend inside.<br><br>As Yates held his sides and groaned, 
Miller peeked out the door and saw four more carloads of Klansmen join 
the first and slowly drive up, down and around the cafe, "circling their
 prey," as one historian later put it. <br><br>They were trying to work their courage up for another go at it. <br><br>Miller
 began to feed coins into the pay phone, calling everybody he knew.  
Local white telephone operators refused to put through calls to the 
black community, so Miller called his mother long distance in San 
Francisco, who in turn called other civil rights activists who in their 
turn called the FBI and the Louisiana state attorney general and the 
media. <br><br>"Remember Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney?" Miller asked a 
UPI reporter on the phone.  "Well you're talking to the next ones right 
here.  We're about to get it."<br><br>But Miller, understandly panicked, was exaggerating the situation.  He was wrong for two reasons. <br><br>First,
 the Klan had a problem.  Surprised by the dash into Andrey's parking 
lot, they had jumped the CORE activists at the edge of Bogalusa's Negro 
community.  This wasn't some lonely road with no witnesses.  Although 
the streets had emptied when the shots were fired, there were any number
 of witnesses peeking out from windows and doorways. <br><br>In 
addition, some of these men, the leaders, were well-known in the black 
community.  They knew that.  Even so, the Klan had reigned around 
Bogalusa for almost a hundred years.  They owned the local police, the 
Sheriff, and other politicians. <br><br>But still, their courage, if you
 can call it that in such cravenly human specimens, failed them.  Too 
stupid to carry out their original plan correctly, too scared to finish 
the job and too proud to just call it a day and drive away, they waited.
  They waited until something very strange happened -- that second thing
 I was talking about. <br><br>It was something almost unprecedented in 
the Klan's experience heretofore.  Something they'd talked a lot about, 
but had never, in their secret heart of hearts, ever thought would 
happen. <br><br>And that something was the Deacons for Defense and Justice.<br><br>__________<br><br>The
 paper plant workers watched from concealment (not cover, Bobby 
recognized ruefully) at the back of Aunt Sylvie's as the Klan cars 
paraded up and down in front of Andrey's Cafe and then stop for a 
palaver as the Kluxers discussed what to do.  They watched the Klan and 
Aunt Sylvie watched them from her back window, unbelievingly. <br><br>"Black mens with guns, Lord have mercy," she worried.<br><br>The
 men were all blown from the exertion of their various runs to get to 
the rendezvous.  Sweating profusely despite the cool February weather, 
Joe Baker wheezed air in and out of his tortured lungs and complained, 
"Damn, I'm too old for this shit." <br><br>Bobby Williams smiled at him, "I been telling you you gotta quit smoking.  It just kills your wind."<br><br>Baker,
 a short, lean man with skin the color of coffee with cream, just 
wheezed and spat, looking back sourly at Bobby, who was ten years 
younger, twice his size and three times blacker.<br><br>Bobby took stock
 one last time.  One Garand, an M-1 Carbine, two lever-action .30-30 
deer rifles, a twelve gauge pump shotgun and the .45 automatic that Joe 
Baker had brought back from the Pacific twenty years ago.  Aside from 
Bobby and Bill Waverly, the guy with the carbine, they had maybe twenty 
rounds apiece, no more.  Bill only had a fifteen round mag for back up 
and a thirty round banana mag in the weapon. Forty five rounds.  Bobby 
had eight in the Garand and forty-eight in the bandoleer.  <br><br>That was it.  Plus the lever-actions and the shotgun would be slow in reloading. <br><br>Thin, real thin.  Well, he'd fought Chinks with less.  And these mostly-fat crackers ain't nearly as tough as Chinks.  <br><br>He smiled, as much to give his men courage as anything. Bobby decided.  <br><br>"Alright,
  we'll do this one at a time.  I'll go first, then you Joe, then the 
rest of you.  The ones behind will cover the one crossing.  The next to 
last man covers the last man from the backdoor, got it?  Bill, you got 
the carbine and plenty of firepower so you come last.  We're puttin' all
 of us into that little shack, I know, but reinforcements are on the way
 and I want to make a good show."<br><br>He swallowed hard.  Thirsty again, his mouth was dry as dust. <br><br>"Don't start anything. But if they start shootin', shoot to kill."  <br><br>Bobby
 paused, looking at them in their faces, each in turn.  They'd talked 
about this, but they'd never practiced it.  Still, every man was a 
veteran of some war.  The Army or Marines had trained them, and trained 
them well. <br><br>Bobby grunted softly. Well, it would just have to do. <br><br>"You with me?" <br><br>"Yeah," the other men, led by Joe, muttered their assent, some of them just nodding. <br><br>Yeah, they were determined. <br><br>This Klan shit ends here. <br><br>Today.<br><br>Bobby
 looked again.  No time like the present.  He leaped up and sprinted 
with his Garand held at high port in front of him across the danger 
space, and came to rest with his back to Andrey's back door.<br><br>Out front, Joe Carl Thornton saw him. <br><br>"Hollingsworth!"
 he yelled to one of the Klan leaders, "I just saw a nigger with a gun 
run into the back!  Shit!  There goes another one!" <br><br>Another Kluxer from down the block yelled, "Hell, there's a bunch of 'em!" <br><br>The
 Kluxers who had guns raised them, but hesitated, uncertain about what 
to do as most of them couldn't see what was happening.  Autie Shingler, 
whose only weapon was a baseball bat, looked down at the Louisville 
Slugger stupidly and shuddered.  He didn't want to die in no shootout 
with no niggers this day or any other.<br><br>Delos Williams, another Klan leader and no relation to Bobby, yelled out the pertinent question, "How many of 'em?" <br><br>"Hell," yelled the second man, almost plaintively, "I don't know.  Mebbe six or seven, mebbe a dozen!" <br><br>"Goddam!" Hollingsworth spat.  "Goddam!" <br><br>Niggers with guns.  This shit was serious.  Gotta get the cops in here to run 'em off. <br><br>"Joe Carl," he ordered, "Get on that police radio and tell 'em we need some deputies to run off these coons!"<br><br>Niggers with guns. <br><br>That was a different deal altogether. <br><br>Shit,
 Hollingsworth thought. Even if the cops talk 'em into leaving, they'll 
take them two pointy-headed Yankee agitators with 'em.   I guess the 
fun's over for today.<br><br>Even so, the Klan stayed as the afternoon started to fade toward darkness. <br><br>But
 the Kluxers now peered behind them into the deepening gloom, and 
wondered, "How many of these black bastards with guns are there?" <br><br>And another thought followed that swiftly, "Am I in their sights right now?"<br><br>Even
 as the other men followed him across, Bobby Williams opened the back 
door at Andrey's and walked in past the cook, who took one look at the 
leveled M-1 rifle in the maintenance man's hands and grinned. <br><br>He'd
 been ready to use his sawed off shotgun if the Kluxers had come into 
his place, but now he was off the hook.  The Deacons were here.<br><br>Miller
 saw Bobby out of the corner of his eye and just about dropped the 
phone.  He knew they'd been guarded by armed men a couple of nights 
before when the Sheriff started floating a rumor that a white lynch mob 
was coming to hang him and Yates, and he recognized Bobby as one of the 
men who had been there.  A feeling of total relief flooded through him. 
 They would not die alone this day, beaten to a pulp even as their 
non-violent beliefs forbade them to fight back.  These men would protect
 him.  It wasn't until later that he realized how hypocritical he was.  
One thing for sure, Miller thought, these guys know the drill.<br><br>After
 a glance around the room, Bobby eased over to the front door, taking in
 the enemy's dispositions with a series of peeks.  His men silently 
arrayed themselves at each door and window, covering the streets outside
 and each other.  These guys have been there before, thought Miller.<br><br>The
 white boy was still frightened though, and after realizing that help 
had arrived but the Klan wasn't going anywhere, he began feeding nickels
 in the payphone again.  He couldn't get a dial tone and he panicked. <br><br>"They cut off the phones!   They cut off the phones!" he shouted, looking at Booby and the other men. <br><br>"Son," said one, "you got to put a nickel in there first." <br><br>Miller
 looked down.  The white boy fished another nickel out of his pocket, 
tried it and got a dial tone.  Sheepishly, he went back to calling the 
outside world.<br><br>"Reinforcements are here," called Bill Waverly 
from the back, and three more men entered.  Bobby wasn't having any of 
that.  There were too many men in here already. <br><br>"Look," he said 
quietly, reasonably, "there's too many folks in here already and we need
 y'all to watch the perimeter and cover us from out there." <br><br>"Well, where do you want us?" one asked. <br><br>"C'mon," said Bobby, "I'll show you where to stand."<br><br>This
 next part was a little dicey, Bobby knew.  He didn't want the Klan to 
think they were pulling out, so he decided to ignore them. <br><br>He turned to the newcomers.<br><br>"Now follow me nice and slow and DON'T get ahead of me.  Don't bunch up, but don't run, walk,"  he commanded. <br><br>The three newbies looked at each other and then nodded in unison. <br><br>Nervous as he was about what he was about to do, Bobby almost laughed.  He shook his head. <br><br>"All, right," he commanded, "follow me."<br><br>Returning
 the hold on his weapon to high port, Bobby Williams stepped out into 
the late afternoon and strolled back to the Aunt Sylvie's place.  His 
reinforcements likewise gripped their weapons and followed like a gaggle
 of baby ducks, two steps behind the man in front. <br><br>"Damn!" said a Kluxer to his buddy who was off to the side enough to see the procession, "Look at that shit." <br><br>When
 he made the concealment at the edge of Aunt Sylvie's place, he began to
 breathe again. One by one, the newbies joined him, out of sight now 
from the Kluxers.  He looked around.<br><br>"OK," he pointed, "you, over
 by that shed, you by the old jalopy over there and you," pointing to 
the man with another carbine, "you stay right here.  Keep a three-sixty 
look out.  Don't let nobody sneak up on you or on us.  If anybody comes 
to firebomb the cafe, you kill 'em, you understand?" <br><br>They all nodded. <br><br>"You," he pointed to the man with the carbine. <br><br>"Yeah?" <br><br>"You know how to use that thing?" <br><br>"Yeah, I was in Korea later than you, but I was there.  You ever hear of a place called Pork Chop Hill?" <br><br>"Yeah," grinned Bobby, "I heard of it." <br><br>He paused, looking down at the man's belt.  "How many mags you got?"<br><br>"Six,
 one in the carbine and four in here."  He slapped the olive drab canvas
 case on his belt.  "And one more in my pocket.  All thirties.  
Hardbacks.  They'll work."<br><br>"OK," Bobby conceded with a grin, 
"you'll do.  You be my squad leader out here.  Anybody else shows up, 
you put 'em where they can cover over there," he pointed, "and over 
there," pointing over on the other side.  "Don't let 'em get too far 
spread out but don't bunch 'em up either.  I want you as a base of fire 
we can fall back on if it gets too hot up there," pointing at Andrey's 
Cafe.<br><br>He looked at his new corporal.  "What's your name?" <br><br>"Demmings." <br><br>"OK, Demmings, I'm countin' on you." <br><br>"Right, we ain't goin' anywhere." <br><br>"You
 best not, or you'll have a helluva lot more than the Klan to worry 
about," Bobby said with a glower and then spoiled it by grinning. <br><br>Demmings grinned back. <br><br>"We'll be here." <br><br>"Oh,
 yeah, one more thing.  Can I have that extra mag you've got in your 
pocket?  I got a man in there with a carbine who's a little light on 
ammo." <br><br>Demmings hestitated, then agreed.  <br><br>"Sure," he said, handing the thirty rounder over, "Iffen you get killed, I'll just get it back from the Coroner afterward." <br><br>Bobby snorted.  He'll do, he thought.  And then he did something even harder than the first walk over. <br><br>He walked back.<br><br>He
 stood to his full six feet two inches, slung his Garand like he was on 
the parade ground, and marched, yes marched, slowly back to Andrey's.  
Head erect, eyes straight, focused on a spot just about the back door.  
His old DI would have been proud.  "Damn," said the Kluxer, "Look at 
that uppity nigger.  LOOK at him." <br><br>None of the Kluxers who saw 
him as much as raised a muzzle.  They were flabbergasted.  THIS had 
NEVER happened before.  It was beyond their experience.  And it scared 
the excremental bejeezus out of each and every one of them.<br><br>Inside, the Deacons welcomed Bobby back in with a whoop and a holler. <br><br>"Damn,
 boy!" exclaimed Joe Baker, "that was as cool as a cucumber in the deep 
shade.  You damn near BEGGED them crackers to shoot you!" <br><br>Bobby grinned, and then turned serious. <br><br>"Get back on your windows and keep watch!" <br><br>But
 secretly, deep in his gut, he smiled.  The crackers were cowards.  If 
they wouldn't shoot at him when he paraded like a tom turkey at a shoot,
 they wouldn't when he could shoot back at them from cover.  This was 
going to be all right.  It wasn't over.  But unless somebody really 
screwed this up by doing something stupid, it was going to be all right.<br><br>As
 if to prove Bobby Williams right, by the time it got good and dark the 
frustrated Klan took counsel of their fears and drove off.  But no one 
knew whether they had left any stay-behinds out there or not. <br><br>The Deacons kept watch, from Andrey's, the lights turned down low.<br><br>Maybe now is a good time to just let the history books tell it like it was:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eventually
 FBI Special Agent Frank Sass in New Orleans reached Miller on the pay 
phone in Andrey's.  The Klan caravan circling the block had melted away 
at sunset, but it was still unsafe for Miller and Yates to leave the 
cafe.  Agent Sass told Miller not to leave until Sass could come to 
Bogalusa and talk to local authorities. <br><br>Miller retorted that the
 agent should not delay calling the Bogalusa officials; he and Yates 
needed protection immediately, and they had already notified the media. 
 "The whole world is watching," Miller warned.</span><br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">As
 the resident agent for Bogalusa, Sass was familiar with the recent 
civil rights activities there.  He soon arrived at Andrey's but balked 
at entering the building.  "Steven Miller, come on out," yelled the 
agent in his distinctive southern drawl.  One of the black guards 
cautioned Miller that the cafe door was illuminated by a light, making 
Miller a clear target if he ventured outside.  "Don't go out there and 
silhouette yourself, boy," warned the man. <br><br>So Miller told Sass 
to come in if he wanted to talk.  The FBI agent opened the door and took
 a few steps inside.  He was not prepared for the scene confronting him:
 the tiny restaurant was packed with black men armed with rifles and 
shotguns. <br><br>"His mouth dropped a foot," remembered Miller with 
some amusement.  "He literally couldn't talk for several minutes.  He 
just stood there stunned."   -- <span style="font-style: italic;">The Deacons for Defense: Armed Resistance and the Civil Rights Movement, by Lance Hill, 2004, p. 98</span></span><br><br>***<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sass left to go arrange for protection to get Yates to a hospital but </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sass
 . . . left without making any promises, saying only that he would speak
 with the state police.  The black guards waited a few hours for him to 
arrange protection, but when the agent failed to return they decided to 
move the CORE men to the home of Bob and Jackie Hicks.  They concealed 
them in the back seat of a car and transported them in an armed convoy 
to the Hicks' house.  When they arrived, Yates and Miller were greeted 
by a second defense force, scattered in trees, behind bushes and inside 
the house.  <br><br>It was imperative to get Yates to a hospital so his 
injuries could be treated, but the local hospital was out of the 
question.  By 10:30 PM CORE's regional office had arranged for a state 
police escort for Yates and Miller.  Four patrol cars soon arrived at 
the Hicks' home.  The ranking patrolman walked to the door.  "He came 
in, took about four steps into the room, and saw all these guys with 
guns and his mouth fell open and he was rooted to the spot," said 
Miller.  "He was just dumbfounded."<br><br>The armed guards relished the moment.  -- <span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid., pp. 98-99.</span></span><br><br>______________<br><br>By
 then, Bobby Williams had handed off his Garand and bandoleer to another
 volunteer, caught a ride to his house, and hugged his wife again before
 rushing off to the Crown-Zellerbach plant.  He still had a shift to 
work, and he did it in the same dirty clothes he'd worn for two days.  <br><br>Three days later, Lucy Williams presented Bobby with his third child, a boy.  They named him Robert E. Williams, Jr. <br><br>In the fullness of time, he would become the first black Attorney General of the state of Alabama. <br><br>But that is another story.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Author's
 afterward:  The chapter you have just read is properly described as 
"faction."  There really was a "skirmish" at Andrey's Cafe on 3 February
 1965.  The events proceeded just as described.  If I have taken some 
liberties with the names and precise actions of the men who would later 
form the Deacon for Defense and Justice chapter of Bogalusa, Louisiana, I
 have, like Alan Eckhart in his "Wilderness" series of novels, merely 
given a best guess at dialogue to situations that are otherwise 
well-documented. <br><br>At this remove, we do not know exactly the 
names of those men first to the Cafe. Many more have claimed to be than 
could have fit in the tiny building.  I have taken the liberty of 
inserting my fictional character Bobby Williams into this historical 
moment.  Miller later reported that the men "moved with military 
precision."  <br><br>Bobby Williams is not such an outlandish guess from
 Miller's account.  I would heartily recommend that anyone seeking the 
facts of the incident, or of the remarkable history of the Deacons 
themselves, should consult Lance Hill's history.  It is an incredible 
story, and one that provides lessons even for today. -- MBV)</span></p>
