 Revolutionary War in the southern states has received little attention 
in comparison to the detailed study given the campaigns in the North.  
This is unfortunate since much decisive action took place there, but 
perhaps the nature of the struggle accounts for the historians’ neglect.
  The heroes of the southern fighting were not the officers of the 
Continental army but rather the natural leaders of the people, who had 
learned their skills in the continuing effort to seize the land of the 
Indians.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">By
 achieving better perspective of the past, something may be accomplished
 in the present.  For the hero of this book has fallen on evil times.  
He is called various unflattering names today and is the butt of 
comic-strip buffoonery and the ‘villain’ of serious novels.  Because he 
remains an individualist, he is a safe target.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">There’s
 nothing new in this attitude, of course.  In the Revolutionary War 
period, he was sneered at by the rich merchants of the lowlands, he was 
held in contempt by the Continental army’s high command, and he was 
considered less than human by the British.  Major Patrick Ferguson 
called him a bandit, a barbarian, a mongrel.  He had little respect for 
law and order.  He could be quite ruthless.  He was also superstitious 
and at times naïve.  Yet Theodore Roosevelt could write of him:</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">     ‘The fathers followed Boone or fought at King’s Mountain; the sons</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> marched south with Jackson to overcome the Creeks; the grandsons</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> died at the Alamo.’</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">And,
 it should be added, the great-grandsons provided Lee and Johnson with 
the best fighting infantry the world had yet seen.  Poorly clothed, 
half-starved, they responded magnificently to magnificent leadership and
 almost won America’s second civil war as their forefathers had won the 
first.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Moreover,
 in wars since, they have always been the cutting edge.  As F.N. Boney, 
the Georgia historian, puts it:  ‘There is no shortage of rednecks in 
the neat, quiet American military cemeteries which now dot the globe.  
However rejected in normal times, the redneck has always been welcomed 
when the nation went to war.’</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Peace
 is the dream today, and the redneck shares that dream.  For him it was 
often a “rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight.”  He never started a 
war, but he was always ready when his home and personal liberty were 
threatened.  And because of the readiness to do his duty, this nation 
was founded and kept alive….</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Given
 proper leadership, the mountain man can still be motivated.  But in 
recent years such leadership has been largely lacking.  The potential 
remains untapped, but it is there.  As my father used to say in Happy 
Valley--  you may turn the damper up, you may turn the damper down, but 
the smoke goes up the chimney just the same.”</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-- Hank Messick, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Mountain-Ridge-American-Revolution/dp/B000QVFLZC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213361267&amp;sr=8-1">King’s Mountain</a>, 1976.</span><br><br>It
 was Will Shipman’s 51st birthday, not that he felt like celebrating.  
The weather was cold, the coffee was cold, he had a cold and his wife 
had been acting cold as a brass monkey all week.  Will knew why Mary was
 mad at him, but there was little he could do about it.  Sometimes 
you’re just stuck with the duty, whether you want it or not. Mary didn’t
 understand that.  Well, maybe she understood it, but that didn’t mean 
she had to like it and she had never been shy about saying what she 
thought.  Heck, that was one of the reasons Will had married her in the 
first place.  Although, Will reflected, it had been a lot more endearing
 when they had been in their twenties than it was now in their fifties.<br><br>“Sometimes
 you’re just stuck with the duty.”   His old shooting buddy Phil Gordon 
had told him that late one night on one of the rare times they'd spoken 
about Vietnam.  William Sheats Shipman had been too young to participate
 in the "Southeast Asia War Games," and one night while sitting at the 
campfire after an unsuccesful day on the deer stands, Will asked the 
older man what it had been like.  Uncharacteristically, Phil Gordon told
 him.  Probably because he considered Will like a younger brother, 
Shipman thought.<br><br>The Shipmans and the Gordons had been kin-close 
for generations, almost 200 hundred years now, Will realized with a 
start.  Both families traced their ancestry back to two men who had 
marched with Andy Jackson in the Creek War.  Together they had helped 
avenge the Fort Mims massacre, and at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend they 
had broken the power of the Red Stick Creeks forever.  Hezekiah Shipman 
and John MacKenzie Gordon had served under Colonel Coffee and his 
sergeant of scouts, the legendary David Crockett of Tennessee.  One 
thing about following Davy Crockett around - each had learned to count 
on the other man's skills and they had saved each others' life so many 
times they had lost count.<br><br>After the fighting ended, they each 
took the 160 acres of free land that the cash-poor government had 
offered the veterans in lieu of pay, and had tramped over north Alabama 
looking for parcels they liked.  Finally they made their hatchet marks 
on trees bounding 320 acres in what became Winston County, Alabama.<br><br>Being
 Indian fighters, and with the memory of the burned stockade at Fort 
Mims fresh in their nostrils, they picked defensible high ground above 
some of the richest bottom land in the area (not that there was much of 
that), building cabins hard by each other, each straddling the property 
line within rifle shot.<br><br>It was inevitable that a Gordon daughter 
would marry a Shipman son, formalizing kinship ties that had first been 
forged in battle.  Succeeding generations of Gordon and Shipman sons 
went off to the wars of their country (and, once, the war came to them).
  The lucky ones came back.  But even if they didn't, there were always 
sons left to shoulder the rifles the next time their country called.<br><br>Will
 had joined up too, in his time, and as an up-and-coming NCO, helped 
rebuild the Army after the disaster of Vietnam.  He enjoyed making a 
difference.  You could just FEEL the Army regain its bearings and its 
honor, especially after Ronald Reagan became President.  Will decided 
that he would be a "lifer."<br><br>But God had different ideas.<br><br>There
 were a lot of screw-ups during the Grenada operation that were never 
really publicized.  Will Shipman got caught in one of them.  By the time
 he left Walter Reed, he was rated unfit for further service and let go 
with an honorable discharge and "the thanks of a grateful nation."  He 
never talked about it, even with family.  Mary knew, of course, and Phil
 Gordon, but that was it.<br><br>Once, for his birthday, Mary had framed
 his Purple Heart.  It was beautiful to everyone except Will Shipman, 
who was reminded once again of the shipwreck of his hopes.  He put it in
 his desk drawer, and never hung it on his den wall as Mary had 
intended, an act that he knew hurt her feelings.<br><br>He had made a 
good life, though, after the Army and Mary was happy for the change.  
She had followed him dutifully from one dilapidated post to another 
during his short career.  She'd paid her dues and Will knew that without
 a doubt, Mary was happier now than she had ever been, with the kids 
married off and grandkids popping up every year or so.  Which was why, 
Will knew, that she was so upset about what must come next.<br><br>Lord,
 Will spoke in silent prayer looking at gathering gloom of the winter 
sky, I sure wish I had Phil here to talk this over with.  After the ATF 
had murdered Phil Gordon (and Will Shipman had no doubt it was murder, 
even if Phil had made it a poor trade for them) he had wanted to go to 
war again.  He got ready and so did his friends, the ones he knew he 
could count on.<br><br>But the country -- shocked by the body count Phil
 had left among his attackers, confused by the media lies that 
criminalized him and his poor family afterward, or (like Will) shocked 
into the sudden realization of how ill-prepared they were for a war that
 they should have seen coming and reluctant to resume the shooting until
 they WERE ready -- well, the country was holding its breath.<br><br>But everyone knew  this phony peace could not last.<br><br>The
 Governor had said so too.  Invoking the old notion of the "doctrine of 
interposition," he had warned the Feds that there would be no more 
Sipsey Streets in his state. Several southern and western states' 
governors did the same.  The Alabama Department of Public Safety was no 
longer cooperating with their federal counterparts.  In retribution, 
federal matching funds for everything from highways to welfare was cut 
off.<br><br>Right now the Governor had half of the state police 
intelligence unit keeping track of the movements and probable intentions
 of every federal policeman in Alabama.  A state grand jury was sitting 
at that very moment, hearing evidence that the Attorney General -- the 
first African American to hold the job and a staunch defender of the 
Second Amendment -- was hoping would lead to a murder case against the 
ATF.  All indications were that the Feds, for their part, intended to 
indict the Governor for failing to obey the new federal laws passed in 
the wake of Phil Gordon's personal Little Big Horn.  There were even 
rumors that the Feds were trying to engineer a political coup d'etat in 
favor of the Lieutenant Governor who was a pro-administration Democrat 
toady.<br><br>Will thought it was like being in a bar room, faced off 
against a bunch of yay-hoos, waiting for the beer bottle to topple off 
the table and set the brawl off with a crash.  You could see it tipping,
 but you couldn't do a thing to stop it.  But if the Governor meant to 
stand between Phil Gordon's murderers and the people of Alabama, Will 
Shipman would stand with him.<br><br>So even if Mary didn’t like or 
understand it, Will Shipman was stuck with the duty.  And if ever he 
felt like shirking it, Will just couldn’t do it.  The ghost of Phil 
Gordon, among others, wouldn’t let him.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1861-1865: Aunt Jenny and the Ghosts of Winston County</span><br><br>Now
 Will Shipman was a man of many parts, as some folks say.  Depending 
upon how you reckoned it, he was a husband, a father and grandfather, a 
hard-worker, a devout church-going man, a Civil War reenactor, a 
registered voter, a disabled veteran, a former Republican and a man 
whose opinions were respected by most all who knew him.  He had an 
easy-going manner and nothing much got him excited, although he was 
mighty upset and morally offended about how the country had been going 
lately, even before the Battle of Sipsey Street.<br><br>But he also was a
 man with a secret and a duty.  The duty was tied up with the secret and
 vice versa, or “vicey versey” as they say in Winston County.  Truth be 
told, Will Shipman WAS Winston County, and Winston County WAS Will 
Shipman.  You couldn't understand the future of the one, without 
understanding the past of the other.<br><br>As I said, Will’s family had
 been in Winston County just about since God made dirt, settling over in
 the western part of the county near Natural Bridge.  The natural bridge
 itself (that is the rock bridge, not the town named after it) was 
beautiful then and now despite all the bloody history that has gone on 
around it.  It is the longest natural bridge east of the Mississippi, 
spanning some 148 feet.  Over 60 feet high and 33 feet wide, you must 
walk beneath the bridge among the wild magnolias, snowball bushes, rare 
ferns, mountain laurel and Canadian hemlock trees in order to appreciate
 the awesome beauty of its size.  Indians sheltered under it long before
 the Will Shipman’s ancestors came, and it was Will’s favorite place in 
the whole world.  Sitting beside the ferns In the quiet of a warm 
afternoon, the glade seemed to be his own private Eden.  He had courted 
Mary beneath the stone bridge, and he proposed to her atop its arch not 
long after he got back from Basic Training.<br><br>But if the natural 
bridge and Winston County were beautiful, and they were, it was a 
terrible beauty nonetheless.  Only someone raised in Winston County knew
 or cared about the particulars of the darker side of history in those 
parts.  There was plenty of it.  The Byler Road, the first state highway
 in Alabama, ran right by Natural Bridge and connected the Tennessee and
 Tombigbee river valleys.  Completed in 1822, the road was only slightly
 less infested with hijackers and highwaymen than its more notorious 
cousin, the Natchez Trace.  An incautious man traveling the Byler Road 
could find himself at dusk on a lonely stretch and never be seen again.<br><br>Even
 without the highwaymen, Winston was a harsh place to try to make a go 
of it.  First of all, the county is “mostly up and down and very little 
sideways” as one pioneer put it.  The topography of Winston County 
varies from rolling and hilly to rough and mountainous.  God had covered
 the county with huge, deep-green forests, consisting of oak, poplar, 
beech, chestnut, sorghum, holly  and shortleaf pine.  Yet the soil was 
so poor that the yeomen farmers who settled there scratched out a bare 
subsistence at best.  Even in places where the soil was sufficient for 
the growing of crops, the unpredictable weather, especially the rains, 
stunted the growth of cotton, the principal cash crop in the 19th 
century.  Consequently, the production of corn made the most hard cash 
for the settlers, especially when turned into whiskey.  Bootlegging is 
an ancient and honorable trade in Winston County: always has been, and 
likely always will be.  Although, it must be admitted that by the first 
decade of the 21st Century, the modern criminal class in the mountain 
regions of the South had long since graduated to marijuana and crystal 
methamphetamine as far more lucrative cash crops.<br><br>But as tough as
 life was for settlers in Winston County in peacetime, the Civil War 
seared the county and its people and forever changed them and defined 
them as proud and defiant survivors.  Will knew all the stories.  Many 
of his ancestors on both sides of his family had killed, and had been 
killed in turn fighting for the Union or simply for the right to live 
and be left alone.<br><br>Back before the turn of the 21st century, Will had picked up a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bushwhackers-Civil-War-North-Carolina/dp/0895870878/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213361725&amp;sr=1-1">“Bushwhackers”</a>
 about the war in the mountains of North Carolina.  It was one of his 
favorites because the descriptions of what went on in the Tarheel state 
mirrored what had happened to his own people.  William R. Trotter 
introduced his history with this passage, which Will Shipman recalled 
word for word, he had read it so many times:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“The
 events that happened in the mountain counties. . . furnish a 
microcosmic view of the Civil War’s effects.  The fighting, the 
suffering, and the dying all took place on an individual scale, and 
there is a recognizably human profile to the drama.  You can tell this 
much from the way the Civil War period remains alive in the generational
 memories and oral traditions of the mountain region.  This certainly 
includes, but goes far beyond, the still-vivid demarcations between 
Republican and Democratic voting patterns in certain counties.  For 
mountain families whose roots go back far, the collective memories do 
not stop with the stories of those who fell at Gettysburg or suffered at
 the hands of Sheman’s invaders.  When they speak of the Civil War, they
 also speak of the dark night on a backwoods lane when great-great 
grandfather was cut down by bushwhackers, or of that raw frontier 
morning when great-great grandmother stood on the front porch of her 
cabin and watched a patrol of Thomas’ Legion — full-blooded Cherokee 
warriors hot with youth and heritage — ride whooping through a patch of 
morning sunlight with fresh Unionist scalps dangling from their saddle 
horns.<br><br>It was a personal kind of war, up in the mountains.  It 
produced its share of heroes and more than its share of bloody-handed 
villains.  The fighting took place in a different dimension than the 
organized battles on the main fronts, where huge formations of uniformed
 men fired massed volleys at other huge formations of distant, faceless,
 uniformed men.  In the mountains, there was little of that long-range 
impersonal killing.  In the mountains, the target in your gunsight was 
not a nameless figure a thousand yards away, positioned at the other end
 of a smoke-obscured battlefield crowded with regiments.  Indeed, he was
 an individual human being with a clear and unique face, and he was, all
 too many times, a man whose identity and home you had known since 
childhood.  When you pulled the trigger on such a man, you did not leave
 a heap of distant bones—one more swollen, powder-blackened piece of 
carrion among hundreds, heaped on the same acreage.  You left a dead man
 whose wife and children you probably knew by name. . .<br><br>The war 
in the mountains may not have been large, but it was vicious, and it 
took place on an all-too-human scale. . .  It was this kind of war in 
the mountains:  The killers had names, their victims had kin, and 
everybody owned a gun.”</span><br><br>Now, going on a century and a half
 later, neither the descendants of the killers nor the descendants of 
the victims had forgotten a thing.  And heck, everybody in Winston 
County still owned a gun, Will thought with a chuckle, most of us own 
more than one.  Some of us own a LOT more than one.<br><br>Will had been
 raised on the stories of the “Free State of Winston.”   What was it 
somebody had said of the Irish?   They had forgotten nothing of history 
and learned nothing from it, either… something like that.  Well, Will 
Shipman hadn’t forgotten where he and his kin came from, but whether he 
had learned something from history, well, that remained to be seen.<br><br>The
 “Free State of Winston” got its name from the turmoil in the region at 
the opening of the War Between the States.  The county, like several of 
the mountainous counties of northern Alabama had sent anti-secession 
delegates to the secession convention down in Montgomery and they had 
been as popular with the planters who ran the convention as a fart in 
church.  A Winston County delegate, Christopher Sheats, had been thrown 
in the Montgomery County Jail because he refused to change his vote.<br><br>After
 the Jefferson Davis declared the Confederacy on the steps of the 
Capitol Building in Montgomery, Chris Sheats was let out of jail.  He 
returned to Winston County an older and wiser man, but no less 
determined to oppose secession.  The mountain folk held a meeting after 
Chris Sheats' release and passed a resolution declaring that if the 
Confederacy left them alone, they would leave the Confederacy alone.<br><br>Dick
 Payne, one of the few secessionists at the meeting, sneered “Ho, ho!  
Winston County secedes!  The ‘Free State of Winston.’”<br><br>Sneering 
aside, the people of the hills of north Alabama sincerely hoped that 
they could continue to live in peace, undisturbed by a war they wanted 
no part of.  It was not to be.  Two new laws of the Confederacy saw to 
that.<br><br>The first was the draft law.  Conscription parties made up 
of the Home Guard and draft officers came up into the hills looking for 
recruits, willing or unwilling.  After the first young men were 
shanghaied, the mountaineers either got of the way of the conscription 
parties or ambushed them.  The fact that the planters exempted 
themselves from the draft made it easier for the mountain dwellers to 
resist.  This was called the “20 nigger rule”.  If a planter could show 
ownership of 20 slaves, they were exempt from the draft.  To men who had
 been arguing that it was a rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight, this 
law merely proved their point.<br><br>The second, and worse ordinance as
 far as the mountaineers saw it, was the tax-in-kind law.  This law said
 that every citizen of the Confederacy was obliged to pay taxes for the 
support of the army, and it they couldn’t afford to pay money, they 
would have to pay “in kind”, that is a portion of their livestock and 
crops.  To the subsistence farmers of the hills, a visit from the Home 
Guard to take their hogs or milk cow could mean starvation for their 
family.  Coming from a government that the hill folk refused to believe 
in the legitimacy of any way, this was mere thievery.  It was too bad 
for the Home Guard, but stealing from poor folks with guns has always 
been a dangerous task.  And the Winston County folks not only wouldn’t 
be pushed around, but they had a highly refined sense of personal 
justice.<br><br>Will Shipman knew all the stories, but not until the book and movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cold-Mountain-Charles-Frazier/dp/0802142842/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213361958&amp;sr=1-1">Cold Mountain</a>
 had the Confederate Home Guards ever been portrayed to the larger 
nation as the thieving murderers that they were.  Will liked that movie a
 lot.  His ancestors had killed more than few Home Guards and he was 
proud of it.<br><br>Will was also related to Aunt Jenny Brooks, and he 
was even prouder of that.  The story of Aunt Jenny was just one of the 
legends to come out of the war in the mountains, but as Will Shipman 
well knew, it was true.  He had seen the hickory stick.<br><br>Will had 
heard the story of Aunt Jenny Brooks told many times by many folks, but 
the first time anybody had put it to paper was back in the nineteen 
thirties when Carl Carmer related what old Tom Knox told him:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“’When
 I knew her,’ said Tom, ‘she was a little dried-up ol’ woman but she had
 talkin’ blue eyes.  She run this county like she was queen of it.  
Nobody ever candidated round here without she said so.  When they had 
the War Between the States a lot o’ people in these parts felt like 
they. . .didn’t want to fight for rich folks in the Black Belt so’s they
 could have niggers do their work for ‘em free.  Folks in this county 
was pretty well fixed then.  They was makin’ liquor the same as now, and
 the lumber companies hadn’t cut over the woods an’ druv away the game 
an’ spiled the land.  So Henry Brooks, Aunt Jenny’s husband, said he 
wasn’t goin’ to be a soldier, he was satisfied to stay right here an’ 
mind his own business.’”<br><br>“Not long after that a party of 
Confederates came up into the hills to force men into their army.  Henry
 Brooks wouldn’t run from ‘em when they come to his house but he fought 
when they tried to take him away an’ they shot him dead.  Aunt Jenny’s 
four boys was little shavers then but she got ‘em all out o’ bed an’ 
made ‘em swear on the dead body of their pa that they’d kill the men 
that shot him.  Well, sir, in the next forty year they got ever’ one of 
‘em.  They kep count with notches on a hickory stick.  Aunt Jenny had 
three of ‘em herself.  One was for the leader.  She cut his head off an’
 cooked it till it was jest a skull an’ made it into a soap dish.  She 
used it ever’ day, an’ jest a minute before she died she washed her 
hands in it for the last time.’”</span><br><br>The last shots of the 
extended feud that began with the murder of Henry Brooks were fired in 
McCurtain County, Oklahoma, in 1904.  In the end, all of the men who 
participated in the killing of Aunt Jenny’s husband were dead, along 
with a considerable number of their sons, brothers and friends.  Aunt 
Jenny outlived ‘em all.  Jenny sure enough kept count, Will knew - he 
had seen that hickory stick.  The skull soapdish had come up missing 
over the years.  His Daddy had said it had apparently been buried by 
church-going niece of Jenny's who thought it looked satanic, 
half-grinning at her from the mantle piece over the fireplace.<br><br>After
 the battle of Shiloh brought the Federal army into the Tennessee River 
Valley, the menfolk of Winston County and the other surrounding mountain
 counties went down to enlist.  The 1st Alabama Union Cavalry Regiment 
was mustered into service at Corinth, Mississippi in 1863 and served 
with distinction till the end of the war.  Their fellow Alabamians 
called them traitors and tories and mossbacks and other names unfit to 
print.<br><br>The men of the Free State of Winston didn’t care what they
 were called as long as they were left alone.  No one pushed them 
around.  No one.  As far as they were concerned, you messed with 
mountain folk at your own peril.  If the Confederates had lost the war, 
and along with it most everything they owned or held dear, well, the 
mountaineers figured the planters had asked for it and they deserved 
what they got.  Of course after Reconstruction ended and the planter 
class took back over, things went hard for Winston County.  But things 
had always been hard up in the hills, and if the unionists regretted the
 decision they had taken, they didn’t tell their descendants about it.<br><br>But, oh, the stories they had left - some like Aunt Jenny’s and some that were worse.<br><br>Will
 Shipman shivered and gathered in the wool blanket tighter around him.  
Oughta throw another log or two on the fire.  Gettin’ too old for this 
re-enacting stuff.  It had been all right when the sun was shining, the 
blue wool uniform helped maintain his body heat.  But the sun was gone 
now, and the naked trees around the campsite flickered in and out of the
 darkness like the ghosts that some said still haunted these parts.<br><br>There
 was Mitch Kennedy, who was shot dead by the Home Guards and whose body 
was pretty well ate up by the hogs before his sickly wife could get help
 to bury him.  And poor Henry Tucker, on leave from the First Alabama 
Union Cavalry, who Stoke Roberts and the other Confederate Home Guards 
had staked to a tree, cutting off a piece of him at a time while a slow 
fire tickled his naked feet.  Roberts had finished him by cutting out 
his liver and eating it, they said.  They left him there, staked to that
 tree.  But Tucker’s neighbors and kin had caught up with Roberts later 
and did the same things to him that he had done to Henry, stroke for 
stroke.  They didn't eat him though, because they were Christians after 
all.<br><br>All the ghosts from the war, all the evil, Will Shipman 
thought.  It was easy enough in the gathering gloom to believe they 
still stalked through these dancing trees in winter, looking for the 
justice in death that they had been denied in life.  Will guessed that 
was why he had become a civil war re-enactor to begin with.  It was his 
own way of letting the ghosts know that they were not forgotten.  And 
some of those ghosts were family.  He didn’t need to play soldier like 
some other re-enactors in Company C seemed to.  He’d been a real 
soldier, in a real war, even if it had been a little one.  So long ago 
and far away it seemed now.<br><br>Yet he still had trouble with night 
skirmishes.  He wouldn’t do them, even now.  The flashes and bangs in 
the night brought back too many personal demons, too much memory.  That 
was one thing he had discovered.  Sometimes, you can remember too much.<br><br>Corporal
 Dan Cutter, who was an advertising account executive in Birmingham 
during the week, emerged from his A-frame tent wrapped in a federal 
pattern greatcoat, fiddle in his right hand and a bottle of Bushmill’s 
Irish Whisky in his left.  Bushmill’s, the toast of the cavalry.<br><br>Cutter came over and sat down on the hardtack box next to his captain.<br><br>“Have a pull, Captain?” the fiddler asked, offering the bottle to Will.<br><br>“Thanks,” Shipman said, unscrewing the cap and taking a sip.  “Just don’t tell my wife,” Will added, handing back the bottle.<br><br>Cutter grinned, “I’m the soul of discretion, sir,” and took a pull himself.<br><br>Replacing the cap, the corporal set down the bottle between them on the cold earth.<br><br>“Would ye like a tune, Captain?” said the fiddler in his best fake-Irish brogue.<br><br>“Sure,” said Will, “Anything.”<br><br>Cutter
 put the fiddle to his chin and struck up “Bonaparte’s Retreat.”  The 
mournful tune echoed in the dead woods and by ones and twos, other men 
and boys of Company C, 1st Alabama Union Cavalry Regiment gathered 
around the fire, listening.<br><br>Will Shipman ignored them, staring 
out into the trees, deep in thought about his wife, Phil Gordon, the 
country and his duty.  Yep, he was stuck with the duty, that was sure.  
His daddy had stuck him with the duty, just like his grandpa had stuck 
his daddy with it.  His daddy had been off to the war when the whole 
thing had happened.  When he got back, Will guessed it had been five or 
six years before Grandpa Shipman had told his son about what was in the 
old mine.  Both a burden and a legacy, the secret passed from generation
 to generation and now it was his.  And the times being what they were, 
it was getting close to the time when Will Shipman was going to have to 
open up that dark shaft and deal with his deadly inheritance.<br><br>“Bonaparte’s Retreat” ended, and Tommy Curtis sat down with his dulcimer beside Cutter on a large piece of cut firewood. <br><br>“Star of the County Down?” Cutter asked.<br><br>Curtis
 nodded, and they struck up the tune by Clinch River Pearl.  The music 
was beautiful but, if anything, sadder than “Bonaparte’s Retreat.”  
Music fit for ghosts, Will thought.  They probably approved the 
serenade, at that.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1945: The Preacher, the Deacon and the Boxcar</span><br><br>His
 daddy had told him how the family came to have the responsibility.  The
 Preacher Luke hadn’t known about his son’s last caper until after the 
funeral.  His no-account brother-in-law Curtis Stampp had sidled up to 
him at the cemetery after the service.<br><br>The bootlegger made his 
condolences and then asked the Preacher if Matthew Mark Luke had called 
him before his death.  The question took the preacher by surprise, and 
the obvious interest of his wife’s brother in the last days of his son 
instantly worried him.<br><br>“No,” said the preacher.  “Did you?”  He fixed the bootlegger with his best right-hand-of-God look.<br><br>“Uh, naw,” stammered the bootlegger.  “I was jest wondering if’n you’d heard from him.”<br><br>“No,” said Parson Luke, still suspicious.<br><br>“Uh, well, I’m sure sorry about the boy.  I know y’all didn’t get along but I always liked him.”<br><br>The
 preacher just looked at the bootlegger, and tried to remember that he 
was commanded to love the sinner but hate the sin.  With his 
brother-in-law, that was especially difficult.<br><br>It was two days 
later, when he’d heard from his wife and other family members that 
Stampp was asking around about Matt Luke and some sort of railroad 
boxcar, that the preacher began to suspect that his brother-in-law might
 have had something to do with his son’s death.  But it was his 
experience with Captain Harrison Fordyce, United States Army, that made 
him certain of it.<br><br>Fordyce roared into the little town of Natural
 Bridge like General Patton four days after the mortal remains Matthew 
Mark Luke were laid to rest.  Accompanied by three MPs, with the Winston
 County Sheriff and a state police captain in tow, Fordyce arrived at 
the little parsonage in a Dodge staff car with all the politeness of a 
Sherman tank.  Fordyce was a fast-talking, nasal New England Yankee, 
with all that implies to a southerner.  He was in a position of 
authority and was used to getting his own way.  He was also in a lot of 
hot water with his superiors over the missing boxcar and the botched 
investigation.  This did not improve his humor nor did it do anything 
for his manners.  And manners are important in Winston County.<br><br>Without
 polite preamble, the captain began to grill the preacher and his wife 
over their son’s misdeeds, the missing boxcar, and their duty in time of
 war to assist the government in retrieving property their son had 
stolen.  Not knowing any of this, Mrs. Luke broke down into tears and 
was so distraught that even hardboiled Capt. Fordyce allowed her to flee
 to her bedroom while he continued the interrogation of the parson.<br><br>Preacher
 Luke was unhelpful to the CID captain.  How could he be otherwise?  His
 son had hardly shared the fact that he was a gambler, bootlegger and 
whoremaster.  Captain Fordyce thought differently, and wondered if a few
 days in jail might jog the parson’s memory. Not trusting the sheriff, 
Fordyce asked the state police captain to take the preacher under arrest
 to Birmingham, where he was lodged for four long days and nights.  
Fordyce had learned something though.  Before taking Preacher Luke into 
custody, he made sure that the minister did not suffer from 
claustrophobia.<br><br>The incarceration did not improve the preacher’s 
memory, as indeed it could not, and it didn’t improve his opinion of the
 government, either.  From the very first minute of Fordyce’s Gestapo 
tactics, Preacher Luke had determined he would tell the overbearing 
captain nothing.  In fact, he decided that if he ever did find out about
 this mysterious boxcar, Fordyce was likely to be the last person he 
called.<br><br>Turned out of Birmingham Jail without an apology or a 
ride, the preacher made his own way back to Winston County, determined 
never to leave there until the Lord called him Home.  But he was also 
determined to find out about the boxcar and what relationship it had 
with his son and his crooked brother-in-law.<br><br>The day Parson Luke 
was let out of jail in Birmingham, Deacon Warren Shipman was out hunting
 when his coon dogs hit on the trail of a raccoon that cut across the 
old Sipsey Coal Company mine tipple on the far corner of the preacher’s 
property.  The Reverend Luke owned more than 240 acres that he had 
inherited on the death of his Uncle Jeremiah.  Jeremiah had sold the 
mineral rights for a song back in the 1890s, and in the Twenties the 
West Sipsey Coal Company had sunk a number of shafts looking for the 
black rock to feed the growing steel industry in the Birmingham 
industrial district.  The coal company had some success, but then ran 
into water and methane, the twin banes of the coal miner’s existence.<br><br>In
 1930, a gas explosion killed two men and the blast caused the lower 
levels of the mine to flood.  Hammered by the depression in addition to 
the disaster, the company folded.  The last thing it did was wall off 
the lower level, board up the mine entrance and post it with big warning
 signs.  Creditors came and hauled off the equipment and the abandoned 
mine buildings were dismantled over the next decade bit by bit to 
provide bricks and wood for other construction in the county.  By 1945, 
the only things left to show there had been a mine there was the 
abandoned tipple and the railroad track spur which led in from the main 
line.<br><br>So it was that when Deacon Shipman came around the tipple, 
chasing his dogs who were chasing the ‘coon, he came face to face with 
the boxcar sitting on the siding and stopped short.  The deacon took a 
look at the lock on the door, saw the US markings and knew even before 
he looked that this was the boxcar the preacher had been thrown in jail 
over.  Mrs. Luke had told him all about it.  But the baying dogs were 
growing fainter in the distance, so Deacon Shipman grabbed up his 
shotgun and continued on the hunt.  But he’d tell the preacher about 
this as soon as he saw him.<br><br>It took the preacher the better part 
of a day to get back to Winston County and his frantically worried wife.
  The next morning he rose to discover that there was little kindling 
left in the box so the Reverend Luke commenced to splitting some more 
out back.  It was here that the Deacon Shipman found him and imparted 
the news about the mysterious boxcar.<br><br>“Warren, I want you to promise that you won’t say a word to anybody about this,” said the Reverend.<br><br>“Preacher, after what they put you through, I won’t tell a soul.  But what are you gonna do with it?” asked the deacon.<br><br>“I
 don’t know, Warren.  Let’s us go take a look in it.”  So they took a 
sledge and chisel from the preacher’s barn to use on the lock and hiked 
back to the mine.<br><br>Deacon Warren Shipman remembered the moment 
they rolled back the door on that boxcar for the rest of his life.  Not 
so much for the fact of what it contained, but for the words that 
blurted out of his preacher’s mouth.<br><br>“Well I’ll be dipped in 
shi….”  Parson Luke caught himself at the last instant.  He hadn’t 
always been a preacher of the Holy Word, and the curse from his sinful 
youth had just popped out.  The deacon stared at his pastor, shocked to 
the soles of his shoes.<br><br>Reverend Luke’s face flushed a deep 
purple.  “I’m sorry, Warren, I just…”  His voice trailed off.  So this 
was what his son had died for.  After Fordyce’s litany of Matt’s alleged
 sins down at Aliceville, the preacher had few illusions about what his 
son had been up to.  Reverend Luke also knew that his low-life 
no-account brother-in-law was involved in this business up to his 
eyeballs.  Well, his son had stolen this war material, that much was 
plain, and by rights it ought to go back to the government.<br><br>But 
the last representative of the United States government that the good 
reverend had encountered was that nasty Yankee, Captain Fordyce.  What 
right did the captain have, terrorizing his wife like that?  And by what
 right had the CID man thrown him in jail on no evidence, for that 
matter?  The minister still faced the next Sunday service, and the 
deacon board afterward, when he would have to explain to everyone the 
extent of his son’s misdeeds and his own involvement.  Would the 
congregation believe him when he told them he had nothing to do with it,
 despite the fact that the Army had him arrested?  He thought they 
would, but already the gossipy old biddies were making up stories about 
what they did not know.<br><br>To turn the boxcar back to Fordyce was 
like ratifying that the CID man had a right to do what he did.  When the
 captain had explained to him how his son had died, the Reverend Luke 
knew it was true.  The boy always did have a terror of small spaces.  
And wasn’t that his fault?  But the guilt and the shame and the anger 
worked on him at cross purposes without decision.  What should he do?  
If he didn’t give the boxcar back to Fordyce, he’d be stealing too, 
wouldn’t he?  And there was never a thought of letting Curtis Stampp 
have the proceeds of his criminal conspiracy.<br><br>His son was dead 
and buried.  The precious son he had held so proudly the day of his 
birth had gone.  Somewhere he had gone astray, and now all the hopes and
 dreams the preacher had for his son were gone, too.  Gone and buried.  
Buried, the Reverend Luke thought.  Yes, that’s it, buried.<br><br>He 
turned to his head deacon and explained what he wanted to do with the 
contents of the boxcar.  They had been friends since the age of twelve, 
grew up together, hunted and fished together, raised cain on Saturday 
nights together, found the Lord at the same camp meeting together, and 
settled down to their lives in Winston County together.  Warren Shipman 
was probably more outraged than the preacher over what had been done to 
him and his wife by that stinking Yankee.<br><br>“Yup, Jim, I’ll help 
you.  But it’s going to be a big job and I don’t think we’d better bring
 anybody else in on it.  It’d better be just you an’ me.  We ought not 
tell our wives either.”  The preacher nodded.  “We’re gonna need some 
tools,” the deacon went on.  “A team of mules an’ a flat bed freight 
wagon and a snatch block.  There’s enough timber around here to do the 
job, but it’s gonna take a while.  What bothers me is what are we gonna 
do with the boxcar once we get it unloaded?  That shiftless sheriff is 
gonna come nosing around here one of these days and how are you gonna 
explain THAT?”  Shipman pointed at the huge railroad car.<br><br>“I don’t know, Warren,” replied the reverend.  “I’ll think on it.”<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">February 28: The Duty</span><br><br>“Star of the County Down” ended on its last, mournful notes.  The deacon’s grandson awoke from his reverie.  He was still cold.<br><br>“Cutter, you’re depressin’ me with all that scratchin’ fit for a funeral.  Can’t you do better than that?”<br><br>“What did ya have in mind, Captain?” asked the fiddler.<br><br>Shipman looked around at his comrades gathered round the fire.<br><br>Little Jimmy Flynn offered, “How ‘bout ‘Poor White Boys’, Cap’n?”<br><br>The
 men agreed, Shipman could see.  It was the 1st Alabama Union Cavalry’s 
unofficial marching song.  It was also know as “The Perfect Penultimate 
Grayback Piss-off Song.”<br><br>“Cutter,” said the captain, “Do you know ‘Poor White Boys’?”<br><br>“Captain, is the Governor a Baptist?”<br><br>“Yeah, I reckon he is.”<br><br>“Well,
 all right then,” said the fiddler and began to scratch out the tune of 
“Bonnie Blue Flag”, that most sacred of Confederate battle songs, only 
the words the boys of the “Thirsty First” sang along with the music 
would have horrified the United Daughters of the Confederacy.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“We are a band of planters, unfaithful to our wives,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fighting for our property, but frightened for our lives.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So when our rights are threatened, our cry goes near and far:</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Send us a million poor white boys to fight our wicked war!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah!  Hurrah!  For planter’s rights Hurrah!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man’s war!”</span><br><br>The Bushmills’ bottle came up again, making the rounds, sloshing into tin cups.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“Ye men of valor gather ‘round, and help us in our plight.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Old Abe’s freed the dark-skinned girls with whom we spend the night.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And just because ye have no slaves, we’ll give you one or two,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As long as you help us in our fight against the Yankee crew.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah!  Hurrah!  For planter’s rights Hurrah!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man’s war!”</span><br><br>In between the verses, the cups were upended, burning throats, and the singing got louder if not more melodious.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“Of course we know that you won’t fight for rich men’s property,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You hardly have enough to eat to feed your family.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So ‘state’s rights’ is the banner we choose to lead your ranks,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And now we won’t repay our loans to all those Yankee banks!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah!  Hurrah!  We’ll profit more, Hurrah!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man’s war!”</span><br><br>As
 the verse ended, Corporal Klingman, already half-lit from his private 
stock when the Bushmills began its journey and who was standing with his
 left boot on a piece of firewood, stumbled when it rolled under him and
 he almost fell into the fire.  His friends roared with laughter, and 
resumed singing, but the beginning of the next verse was a little 
ragged.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“But when the long roll beckons and you all fall into line,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Of all the many faces there you surely won’t see mine.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I’ve business to attend to, and I’m certainly no fool.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I’ll stay right here and hide behind the ‘Twenty Nigger Rule.’</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah!  Hurrah!  For planter’s rights Hurrah!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man’s war!”</span><br><br>Their
 voices echoed down the glen, through the naked trees.  If there were 
indeed Unionist ghosts out there, they liked the tune.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“We’ve mountain loads of cotton that’s already been picked,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bought by the Confed’racy, unable to be shipped.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Jeff Davis says to burn it, but the Yanks’ll buy we’re told.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We’ll compromise our principles, IF THEY PAY IN GOLD!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah!  Hurrah!  We’ll profit more, Hurrah!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man’s war!”</span><br><br>The
 bottle came ‘round to Shipman again, but the captain declined to take 
another drink, handing it off to First Sergeant Williams, who took a 
healthy slug, even by cavalry standards.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“And when the war is over, and our independence won,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We’ll host a celebration for those left alive to come.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There’ll be food and drink aplenty and our daughters there to charm,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Engaged to other planter’s sons WHO NEVER LEFT THE FARM!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah!  Hurrah!  For planter’s rights Hurrah!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man’s war!</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah!  Hurrah!  For planter’s rights Hurrah!</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man’s war!”</span><br><br>The
 re-enactors of the First Alabama cheered and hooted and huzzahed.  This
 was their song and they loved it.  Their forefathers had despised the 
Confederacy and this was their way of letting everybody know that if it 
was good enough for their great- great- granddaddies then it was good 
enough for them.<br><br>Somebody yelled “Minstrel Boy!” and the fiddler struck up the tune with all of the by-now well-lubricated troopers joining in.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“The minstrel boy to the war is gone, in the ranks of death you will find him.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">His father’s sword he has girded on, and his wild harp slung behind him.”</span><br><br>His father’s sword, Shipman thought, staring into the fire.  Yeah, that’s what I got.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“Land of song, said the warrior-bard, though all the world betrays thee.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One sword at least thy right shall guard, one faithful harp shall praise thee.”</span><br><br>Will
 Shipman made up his mind.  He knew a fellow who had a friend who worked
 in the governor’s office.  Maybe there was a way he could discharge the
 duty he was stuck with, officially.  Mary would like that.  Lord knows 
that in the Governor’s sea of troubles he might not notice one more.  
Then again, maybe the contents of the mine would help a little, in the 
right hands.  He’d make the call on Monday.  Will blew hot breath on his
 cold fingertips, and then held his hands palms out toward the fire, 
flexing his fingertips up and out, luxuriating in the warmth.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">“The minstrel fell but the foeman’s chains could not bring that proud soul under.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The harp he loved ne’er spoke again, for he tore its chords asunder,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And said 'no chain shall sully thee, the soul of love and bravery.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thy songs were meant for the proud and free, they shall never sound in slavery!'”</span><br><br>“Never
 sound in slavery.”  That was a cause in which Will Shipman had enlisted
 a long time ago.  It wasn’t new to Winston County either.<br><br>Yes, he’d make that call on Monday, he surely would.<br><br>And Phil Gordon, he knew, would be pleased.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">(To be continued . . .)</span></p>

							<p>This praise for the Yankee destroyers of the Contitution under
 Lincoln and his minions is disgusting. Some of my people owned slaves, 
an evil, but most did not, and they fought against the invader who came 
to loot and pillage their homes and property. The South was Right.</p>

							<p>My great-great grandpa and his two brothers fought at Shiloh 
(Pittsburgh Landing) and were captured by Confederate cavalry during the
 final Union assault that carried the day. They were sent to Belleville 
where his brothers starved to death. He escaped when a distant cousin 
who was a guard recognized him and sent him on his way from a work 
detail with a pair of shoes and a sack of dried corn. He returned home 
to east Tennessee where he recovered his health. After the war he 
immigrated to the Blue Mountains of eastern Washington Territory and 
became a rancher. My grandpa told me his grandpa always thought he did 
the right thing as the rich men rarely served and slavery stole work 
from the poor, blacks and whites alike. None the less, he also 
recognized that the rich in the north were no better. Some things never 
change. His son saw the same thing in the Philippines while serving with
 the Oregon Volunteer Infantry (state militia) in 1898-1901. The South 
was wrong. So was the North. By the way South men, out here we regard 
anyone from south of the Siskyous and east of the Rockies as a Yankee.</p>
