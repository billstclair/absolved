 workshop was scattered with manuals.  Other than the strange smells, 
that was the first thing you noticed.  Some were open, face up, others 
face down.<br><br>Some had obviously come from the military.  There was 
FM 9-13, "Ammunition Handbook", and TM 31-210, "Improvised Munitions 
Handbook".  There were even reprints of very old manuals such as "The 
Ordnance Manual for the Use of the Officers of the United States Army, 
Third Edition", dated 1862 and H.L. Scott’s "Military Dictionary", first
 printed in 1861.<br><br>Then there were manuals of civilian provenance, mostly printed by that most notorious of publishing houses, <a href="http://www.paladin-press.com/">Paladin Press</a>.  There were titles like "Home Workshop Guns for Defense and Resistance", <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Truby</span> and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">Minnery</span>’s
 two-volume set of "Improvised Modified Firearms", and that staple of 
the ‘90s citizen militias, Ragnar Benson’s "David’s Tool Kit: A 
Citizen’s Guide to Taking Out Big Brother’s Heavy Weapons".  On the 
shelves above the work table were classics such as <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">Tenney</span>
 Davis’s 1943 work, "The Chemistry of Powder and Explosives", Bert

 Bern’s "Total Resistance", DuPont’s "Blaster’s Handbook", and several 
different editions of "Small Arms of the World", interspersed with 
reloading manuals and back issues of <a href="http://www.shotgunnews.com/">Shotgun News</a>.<br><br>At
 the moment, there were two manuals face up on the work bench - 
"Evaluation of Improvised Shaped Charges" by Anonymous, published in 
1980 by Desert Publications of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">Cornville</span>, Arizona, and "Improvised Rifle Grenades" by the aptly named expert, “Powder Burns”.<br><br>Mark
 “Kraut” Mueller was 52 years old, old enough to know better than to 
play around with improvised munitions.  The fact that he had quietly 
enjoyed this hobby since 1968 when he first got access to serious 
chemicals after his sophomore science teacher picked him as a lab 
assistant was known to a very few people.  The fact that the FBI knew it
 as well would not have concerned Mueller very much.  He had been very 
careful over the years not to cross the line of criminal conspiracy, and
 prior to this day had been more interested in preserving his knowledge 
and ability to build improvised explosive devices than in actually 
making them.  It was a skill that he always held back UNTIL.<br><br>Well, now “until” had come.<br><br>Of that he was certain.<br><br>This
 was where the design for Phil Gordon's improvised anti-personnel rifle 
grenades had come from.  Mark Mueller had know Phil for years. Although 
he couldn't rank him as a friend, they certainly had been friendly.  
Both had fought as allies in the legislative gun control wars in Alabama
 over the years.  Phil was never shy about what he thought of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">ATF</span>, which is probably why they had come to take him that night.<br><br>About a week before the battle, Phil had come to see Kraut at his house.<br><br>"I
 need to ask a favor," he had begun. It was a big favor, and it involved
 a huge leap of faith and trust for Mark Mueller.  He had taken it.<br><br>Still,
 if the Feds knew that he had given Phil his design, they would have 
come for him already.  So Phil must have taken that secret to his grave.
  How Phil put it together that he had been working on them was easy, 
Mark now understood:<br><br>"Hell, Mark, I've been knowing you for 
fifteen nigh onto twenty years and for half that time you've been 
beating the drum for that damn Alabama Grenadier Society y'all go play 
with dummies at.  I just figured that if I hadn't been so damn cautious 
all these years, that might be something I would have done.  It don't 
take Sherlock Holmes."<br><br>Mark hadn't perfected the anti-tank grenade yet, but he had given Phil the plans for the anti-personnel grenade.<br><br>Phil had done the rest himself.<br><br>Truth be told, Mark <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">hadn</span>’t actually tested a device in almost ten years, after Waco and the gun bans had convinced him that the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">Clintonistas</span>
 were finally going to try to pick up America’s guns.  Then, as now, 
Mark was the closest thing the Alabama Constitutional Militia had to an 
ordnance officer.  He had conducted many discreet training sessions, 
always SHOWING how but never DOING.  He had demonstrated everything from
 the utility of dummy rifle grenades in training to how to manufacture a
 <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">thermite</span> device to take out an M1 Abrams tank.  He had worked up a 12 Gauge <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">flechette</span> load that could reliably penetrate an <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">ATF</span>
 raid vest of the Nineties at twenty meters and then publicized it so 
that not only would the various citizen’s militias know how to make them
 but the “gun gestapo” would know that they were more vulnerable than 
before.<br><br>Anything that slowed down the people who had started the 
Waco atrocity and made them more cautious was a positive social good as 
far as Kraut Mueller was concerned.<br><br>For this and other sins, Mark was not popular with the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">ATF</span>,
 nor did the FBI like him either.  Both agencies had tried to entrap him
 over the years with a variety of scams and provocations, most of them 
unimaginative if not stupid.  Mueller had evaded them all, and for a 
fellow of his political stripe that was saying something.<br><br>The 
Feds always had a theory that a gun enthusiast with political opinions 
was just this side of a terrorist, and the Clinton administration made 
sure that their FBI stooges kept close track of militia folk.  The irony
 that the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">Fibbies</span> spent so much time spying on the militias that they let the September 11 conspiracy get past them was not lost on Kraut.<br><br>What morons.<br><br>Most of them <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_23">weren</span>’t
 evil characters, of course.  They were just federal bureaucrats working
 toward retirement.  Of course some of them fit Hannah <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_24">Arendt</span>’s definition of the “banality of evil” - Jim <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_25">Cavanaugh</span> of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_26">ATF,</span>
 for one.  But for the most part they were guys who joined after a stint
 in the military or the local cops and who thought they could do some 
good fighting bad guys.  When an administration took over that defined 
bad guys as anybody with a gun who <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_27">didn</span>’t hew to the administration political line - well, the agents <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_28">weren</span>’t in an easy position to say differently.  Even if they thought the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_29">Clintons</span> were borderline treasonable (and many did), they <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_30">weren</span>’t about to jeopardize their retirement pay.<br><br>Oh,
 some of them resigned out of principle, but darn few.  Mostly they 
turned into the guys who, when ordered to do something patently 
unconstitutional like the Waco raid, saluted and put on their raid gear.
  You know, the same kind of “decent Germans who just followed orders” 
that we hung at Nuremberg for war crimes.<br><br>Meet them in a bar, and
 you could get to like them.  But if they came to your door, you’d 
better be prepared to take their lives.  Because they showed at Waco and
 Ruby Ridge, and now at the Battle of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_31">Sipsey</span>
 Street, that they were ready to take yours.  Not only that, but they'd 
kill your wife and kids as well and be unapologetic and unrepentant 
afterwards. And as far as Mueller understood, “Waco Rules” were still 
the way the Feds ran things.  If <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_32">Sipsey</span> Street proved anything, it proved <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>, even if the Feds had gotten more than they bargained for.<br><br>Of course, since that was the way Mark viewed things (and he <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_33">hadn</span>’t
 been shy about sharing his opinions with the Feds) no one ever came to 
his door, at least until now.  While that might be because the Feds <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_34">couldn</span>’t make a case on him, Mark <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_35">didn</span>’t
 think so.  They’d framed others before and got away with it.  The 
federal prisons were still populated with so-called “militia leaders” of
 the Nineties who’d been talked into one piece of tomfoolery or another,
 or at least the federal prosecutors had made juries believe that they 
had.<br><br>But Kraut was of the opinion that the reason he’d never been
 raided was because he had made it plain that Waco Rules were still in 
force and that he would kill as many Feds as he could before he went 
down.  No federal prison for Mrs. Mueller's son, that was for sure.  
Kraut knew the Feds could kill him any day they decided it was worth it,
 but he’d made it plain to them it had better be worth the chance of 
them not living to collect their retirement.  And Kraut knew, as did the
 <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_36">Fibbies</span>, that he had enough friends to collect the butcher’s bill if he could not.<br><br>So far, his own private policy of “mutual assured destruction” had kept him alive.<br><br>So far.<br><br>But after <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_37">Sipsey</span> Street, Mark Mueller was sure, the dynamic had changed. The gloves were off now.<br><br>Phil Gordon's spectacular resistance had changed everything.<br><br>The work shop was in the windowless basement of a business establishment owned by a good friend, a fellow who <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_38">wasn</span>’t
 associated with the militia in any public way.  In fact, there were 
perhaps three people in the whole world who knew of the workshop’s 
existence.  There was only one access door to the stairs from the 
inside, and it was both steel and triple locked.  You could only get to 
the door by passing through the private office of the owner, which, 
because he handled lots of cash in an average business day, was equally 
secured with alarms, steel doors, controlled access and bulletproof 
windows.<br><br>In fact, the building had been constructed just four 
years ago with just this dual-purpose in mind.  The hard-working owner 
was one of the few patriots Mark knew who had money to burn, for most of
 the other militiamen and women were poor as church mice.  In the shop, 
Mueller could feel as secure from prying eyes as in one of the unit’s 
supply dump caves up in <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_39">Blount</span>, St. Clair or Winston counties.  And that was good, because you <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_40">didn</span>’t need to be nervous when playing around with improvised explosive devices, particularly the kind Kraut was about to fabricate.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">“Rifle
 grenades are the Marine rifleman’s best weapons for use against tanks, 
pill boxes and, in some cases, enemy personnel.  They are also effective
 as signaling agents, for screening effect, and as an incendiary against
 inflammable targets.  They are similar to hand grenades, but have 
greater range since they are fired from the muzzle of the rifle by use 
of a special blank cartridge.  Certain types are much more powerful than
 hand grenades… Rifle grenades are versatile weapons and can perform 
many jobs if the right grenade is used for the particular task at hand. 
 They may be fired singly or in groups, at low or high angle, and they 
can cover the dead space between the distance you can throw a hand 
grenade and the minimum range of mortar and artillery fire.” </span></span><br><br>Or so said the"Guidebook for Marines", May 1966 edition, anyway.<br><br>In
 any case, for his purposes, Kraut was already sold on the military 
utility of rifle grenades.  It helped that he and his friends really had
 few other choices.<br><br>By the turn of the 21st Century, rifle grenades were considered <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_41">passé</span>
 by just about every military establishment on the planet, except 
Israel.  The United States Army had dropped them from the inventory 
toward the end of the Vietnam War in favor of a 40mm grenade launcher, 
first the M79, then the M203.  The M203, slung on the underside of an 
M16 series rifle, was still standard issue and Mark’s son Mike, a clerk 
in the 101st Airborne Division’s headquarters had used one in Iraq on 
convoy duty.  At ranges farther than the M203, the Army used mortars, 
anti-armor rockets, artillery or direct-fire cannon to suppress their 
enemies’ fire.<br><br>However, the militia had no mortars, anti-armor 
rockets, artillery or direct-fire cannon.  These were forbidden to them 
by federal law as “destructive devices.” Nor could any of those weapons 
they be easily fabricated by small workshops like the one Mueller was 
sitting in.<br><br>But what the militia did have a lot of were rifles-- 
bolt action and semiautomatic rifles.  And some of those rifles had 
military spec flash hiders on them that doubled as rifle grenade 
launchers.<br><br>There were rifles chambered in 7.62 NATO (called .308 or three-oh-eight by civilians) like the Spanish FR-8, the Belgian <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_42">FAL</span>, the German Heckler &amp; <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_43">Koch</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_44">HK</span>91 and the French MAS 49-56.  There was also a variant of the Soviet <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_45">SKS</span>
 rifle chambered in 7.62x39 made by the Yugoslavians that was set up for
 launching NATO specification rifle grenades, courtesy of Tito's little 
falling out with Stalin.  At the moment, these were selling for less 
than $200.00 each.<br><br>Both the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_46">SKS</span> and the MAS 49-56 had the advantage of having integral grenade sights.<br><br>There were also rifles that could be fitted with grenade launching attachments like the venerable Springfield 1903 and the M1 <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_47">Garand</span> of WWII issue - both chambered in .30-06 -  or the civilian semiautomatic version of the US M14 rifle chambered in 7.62 NATO.<br><br>So there were plenty of grenade-launching platforms in militia hands.<br><br>It
 was also legal to own such a rifle (for the moment anyway) and you 
could go out to a range, a pasture or an old strip mine and launch 
grenades, as long as they were inert practice grenades.<br><br>"The beauty of the rifle grenade," wrote one military advocate on the Internet, "<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_48">is</span>
 you can train on them anywhere there is an open space to shoot.  You 
simply take practice rifle grenades and launch them with low-cost blanks
 at your targets to perfect your aim.  After shooting them, you go down 
range, pick them up and shoot them again.  And again.  'Practice makes 
perfect' is the by-word for a can-do generation that doesn't wear 
t-shirts with slacker mottoes like 'If you can't win don't try.'  
Perfect aim allows you to hit bad guys in moving cars when the chips are
 down and lives are on the line."<br><br>The grenades were projected 
from the rifle by means of a special grenade launching blank, and 
Mueller's militia unit had been manufacturing such blanks for years, 
using  a special star crimp die that had cost more money than Kraut 
cared to remember.<br><br>Mark had the charge data for 7.62 NATO grenade blank taken from the 7<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_49">th</span> edition of Cartridges of the World posted above his reloading table across the room.

 recently, US military practice grenades like the M-31 were available to
 purchase from surplus outlets like Rock Island Armory of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_55">Geneseo</span>,
 Illinois, although the prices had gone up over the past decade from 
about $5.00 each to $25.00 and up and up.  Part of the problem was that 
the M31, painted blue like most US training munitions, was made of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_56">sheetmetal</span>
 and the fins were prone to tear off after just one use.  Even if you 
had the means to rebuild the fins, by the second or third use the 
warhead would break away from the launching body tube and all you'd be 
left with was a pile of junk.<br><br>That was if you could find it.  The grenades got lost as often as not unless you tied a three foot long piece of <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_57">fluorescent</span>
 engineer's tape to the tail and stationed a spotter out in the impact 
zone.  So between militia training usage and the fact that no M31s had 
been made since the Sixties, that well was about dry.  They were still 
available if you looked real hard, but the price was exorbitant.<br><br>This
 was unfortunate for improvised munitioneers like Kraut because the M31 
lent itself to reactivation, especially because the shape and 
composition of the training round was perfect for the shaped charge 
necessary to be an effective antitank round. Powder Burns' book, 
"Improvised Rifle Grenades", was a tutorial on rearming an M31 with a 
shaped charge of home-made C4.<br><br>The shaped charge principle had 
first been discovered in 1888 by Charles Edward Munroe, a professor of 
chemistry at the U.S. Naval Academy.  While working at the Naval Torpedo
 Station at Newport, Munroe found that that if a block of guncotton with
 letters countersunk into its surface is detonated with the lettered 
surface against a steel plate, the letters are indented into the surface
 of the steel.  Likewise, if the letters are raised above the surface of
 the guncotton, by detonation they are reproduced in relief on the steel
 plate, embossed and raised above the neighboring surface.<br><br>In 
other words, the greatest effects are produced on the steel plate at the
 points where the explosive material stands away from it, at precisely 
where explosive waves from different directions meet and reinforce each 
other.  Munroe found that by increasing the depth of the concavity in 
the explosive he was able to produce greater and greater effects on the 
plate until with a charge which was hollowed out all the way, he was 
able to punch a hole completely through the steel plate.<br><br>Later 
ordnance scientists would learn that the effects of the shaped charge 
was independent of velocity - that is, it was unimportant if the charge 
was laid next to the steel plate or fired into it at great speed.  The 
important thing was that for any given size and shape of charge, there 
was an optimal point above the steel plate (called the stand-off) where 
the effects of charge were maximized.<br><br>In addition, it was 
critical to locate the detonator at the center of the rear of the 
charge, so as to focus the resulting explosion.  Finally, the conical 
cavity at the front of the charge must, for maximum effect, be lined 
with a ductile metal like copper.  When the explosive is detonated the 
liner is deformed into a high velocity molten metal jet which is capable
 of penetrating armor plate.<br><br>Minor changes in any of these three 
factors: stand-off, detonation point and liner make a great difference 
in the ability of a given charge to penetrate modern armor plate.  While
 an unlined shaped charge would work, it was far less efficient for 
antitank work than a similar lined charge.<br><br>Phil Gordon's improvised rounds had been unlined.<br><br>Mark intended to line his.<br><br>Mueller
 studied the tables in "Evaluation of Improvised Shaped Charges", then 
put his micrometer on the sheets of copper, alloy and aluminum that he 
had been able to scrounge at the industrial surplus supply store on 41st
 Street in Birmingham.  Mark jotted the measurements down in his 
journal.  He would use all three in the prototypes to see which worked 
best.<br><br>Weight was also a critical consideration.  Kraut had come 
to the conclusion that the M31 was going to be best for antitank 
purposes.  But if the larger goal of a "universal fed discourager" was 
to be met, he would have to find a design that could be produced by 
anybody from the stocks at their local hardware or building supply 
store.<br><br>Kraut had about 500 inert M31s, new in the cardboard 
shipping tubes, stashed in a friend's barn up in Blount County, courtesy
 of a trade he'd made ten years ago with an itinerant surplus dealer.   
"Shorty" Long had bought them for scrap price from the property disposal
 office at Anniston Army Depot sometime in the misty past and needed to 
get rid of them because he'd lost his storage area due to divorce.<br><br>His
 ex-wife got the kids, the furniture, the car and the house, he got the 
military surplus, the alimony, the child support and their three 
legged-dog. In retrospect, there was no doubt that his ex-wife, as 
ex-wives often do, got the better part of the deal.  Still, Shorty clung
 to the comforting thought that the three-legged dog, which of course 
was named "Lucky", had a sweeter disposition than his ex-wife.<br><br>"Even if they were both bitches," he told Mark.<br><br>But just as the supply of M31s had pretty much run out, the Israelis came to the rescue.  Earlier that year, <a href="http://www.e-gunparts.com/">Numrich Gun Parts Corporation</a>
 of West Hurley, New York started advertising a new lot of Israeli 
Practice Grenade Sets for $140.00 each in gun industry magazines like 
Shotgun News.<br><br>The set contained six inert rifle grenade 
assemblies with rubber warheads patterned after the Israeli Military 
Industries BT/AT-44 dual purpose rifle grenade.  These dummy grenades 
came with removable launching body tubes and tail fin assemblies so that
 if one piece were damaged in training, it could be repaired with a new 
part.<br><br>But that wasn't the beautiful thing about these Israeli 
grenades.  The beautiful thing was that in addition to the six complete 
assemblies, the white wooden crate that Numrich shipped to you held 40 
extra plastic fins and 32 launching body tubes.<br><br>And it was the launching tubes and fin assemblies that Kraut coveted.<br><br>Improvising
 a warhead, whether it is anti-personnel or anti-tank in design, is one 
thing.  Mueller was already pretty good at that.  But what was beyond 
Mark's abilities was a low-tech way to duplicate the intricacy of the 
fin assembly and the stout metallurgy and critical tolerances of the 
launching body tube.  What the Israelis (through the good offices of 
Numrich Gun Parts Corporation) had provided was six training grenades 
and the makings of thirty-two more improvised rifle grenades.  And Kraut
 figured that really was worth $140.00.  Not to mention the fact that 
the six rubber dummy grenades were so stoutly designed and built that 
they hardly ever tore up in routine training.  Compared to the M31 
sheetmetal dummies, the Israeli rubber grenades were indestructible.<br><br>Six
 months ago, when he first understood the potential of the Israeli kits,
 Mueller tapped his friends for enough money to buy ten of them.  In the
 intervening weeks, Kraut had figured out how to adapt the fin and 
launching tube assemblies to common pipe fittings which enabled him to 
adapt them to any kind of warhead he could design.  What he was doing 
now was putting all the elements together, including the explosive 
charges, into test prototypes.<br><br>By doing so, he was violating 
federal law.  But the prototypes were merely to test the theory that 
effective rifle grenade warheads, both antipersonnel and antitank, could
 be manufactured in basement workshops.  Kraut had no intention of 
mass-producing warheads at this point, even though he had the means to 
do so.  He knew that with the help of a dozen militia members, he could 
arm all 500 of his M31s and 300+ of the Israeli hybrids in a week when 
and if he had to.<br><br>Now he merely wanted to test the designs so 
that, once proven, his manufacturing instructions could be circulated 
within the militia movement, much like his design for the 12 Gauge 
flechette load.<br><br>But after Sipsey Street this was no longer about 
trying to maintain credible deterrence.   War, if it was not already 
here, was coming fast.  That was what brought Kraut Mueller to this work
 bench.<br><br>The first problem was that the Israeli tubes were open at
 both ends, so the business end would have to be plugged.  No problem 
there.  Mark went to his local Lowes building supply store and found 
copper 1" pipe caps that with a bit of tapping with a large ball peen 
hammer could be driven down into the open end of the launching tube, 
swedged tight.  Of course the friction fit would not hold against the 
overpressure on the inside of the tube upon launching, but Mueller had 
an idea about that too.<br><br>The second problem had been the threads 
on the Israeli launching tubes.  Mark could find nothing locally to 
match them.  They were about 1" O.D. so after perusing some plumbing 
industry websites he came up with a female to male adapter, the female 
end being smooth (designed for sweating onto copper pipe).  The male end
 was 1" pipe thread making it easy to adapt whatever optimally sized 
warhead he might construct.  The problem was with the sample he bought 
from Home Depot.  While the smooth inner surface of the female end of 
the copper fitting would slide over the threaded end of the Israeli 
tube, it was loose and there was no way to self-thread the alloy tube 
into the fitting.  That had been easy to fix.  Mark found some thin 
aluminum shim material, bent it into round and slipped it over the tube 
before he tapped the female end of the fitting into place.<br><br>To 
solve the problem of holding both the cap and the fitting in place on 
the tube, Kraut drilled a 1/4" hole through the fitting, tube and cap 
and ran a bolt through the assembly, topping it with a locknut on the 
other side.  Thus secured, the tube and cap would hold up to the 
stresses of firing. He had already tested that theory with a dummy 
warhead made out of 1-1/2" PVC pipe with a playdough filler.   Fired off
 of a Chinese-clone M14S retrofitted with a USGI flash suppressor and an
 M76 launching attachment, the grenade had sailed almost 300 meters, 
landing nose down.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br>Mark now knew he had a 
projectile suitable for antipersonnel rounds, at least, and maybe 
antitank rounds as well.  That was what he working on now.  The 
base-detonating fuse arrangement was a proven type designed by a couple 
of East Texas militiamen back in the Nineties who had a flair for 
technical design.  One of the two was tall and lanky, the other shorter 
and more compactly built, so Kraut had dubbed them "Mutt and Jeff."<br><br>The
 problem with all fuses is how to construct them so that they will be 
robust enough to stand up under the stresses of launch, yet sensitive 
enough to detonate their cargo on the other end.  After studying many 
types of artillery fuses from the Civil War to the Nineties, the Texas 
boys had devised a mechanism small enough to fit in a projectile, robust
 enough to be safe to launch, and reliable enough to work on impact-- 
and all of the components were available at your local hardware store.<br><br>Their
 original design had been mated to an black powder burster/antipersonnel
 charge launched by twelve gauge shotgun using the old 
blank-shotgun-shell-and-broomstick arrangement first outlined in Che 
Guevara's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guerilla-Warfare-Che-Guevara/dp/0803270100/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1215314605&amp;sr=8-3">Guerrilla Warfare</a>.
  Mark had been impressed when Mutt and Jeff had demonstrated it for him
 back in 1997 when he made a trip out to the Lone Star state.  What 
really impressed him was not the reliable fuse, but the guts of the men 
who put the shotgun to their shoulders and touched off the infernal 
contraption.<br><br>Whenever Kraut tested a rifle grenade or rifle 
grenade launching platform, he lashed the rifle to an old tire and used a
 very, very long lanyard to touch it off.  This procedure had saved 
Mark's life more than once.  That Mutt and Jeff did not do this said 
something about either their cojones or their sanity, Mark wasn't sure 
which.<br><br>Mueller was now taking their design a step further by 
working it into the highest efficiency rifle-launched projectile able to
 be constructed by a basement workshop.  First came the antipersonnel 
round.  For this warhead, designed to throw shrapnel in every direction,
 it was better to move the fuse point of detonation into the center, 
rather than the base.  Based on tests of varying size and weight, Mark 
had already calculated the best throw weight for the grenade.  With this
 knowledge in hand, he found components which when assembled would match
 the optimum weight.  Schedule 40 or Schedule 80 PVC was fine for a 
casing, light but reasonably strong.<br><br>Kraut had worked up a jig to
 hold an electric drill with the chuck extending above the table top of 
the work bench at a 90 degree angle.  Into the drill chuck, he inserted 
an adjustable cup that would hold the PVC pipe and adapter base (already
 glued together using PVC cement).  As the drill rotated the PVC 
warhead, Mark squeezed in glue until it was covering the inner wall 
completely with a thin layer.  Then he would insert steel ball bearings,
 small nails, or some of the flechettes he had left over from the 
anti-ATF shotgun shell project.  The centrifugal force of the rotating 
casing distributed the projectiles along the casing wall.  Then in went 
more glue and more projectiles, always leaving room for the fuse 
mechanism and explosive charge.  He had done this years before when 
working on improvised hand grenades, testing them inside a railroad 
culvert lined with plywood-backed poster board so he had been able to 
analyze the blast patterns.  Steel ball bearings seemed to throw the 
most consistent pattern, regardless of whether he used black powder, 
aluminum flash powder or improvised C4 as a burster.<br><br>Over the 
past ten days, Mark had completed all of the design work and 
prefabrication of components necessary to make 2 grenades of each type 
he wished to test.  There were antitank grenades of differing sizes and 
liners, 3 on the M31 platform (each with a different composition liner) 
and 9 different Israelis, antipersonnel and antitank.<br><br>What the 
militia ordnance man was doing now was the assembling of the final 
product, including loading in the C4 and arming the East Texas 
detonators.  He worked slowly and carefully, stopping often to get up 
and stretch.  He was sweating despite the coolness of the basement and 
every so often would mop his face with an old dish towel.<br><br>Eight 
and a half hours after he began, the last of the improvised rifle 
grenades was nestled in its cardboard shipping tube, six tubes to a 
backpack.  The backpacks were made of Realtree camouflage pattern of the
 type some hunters use, and Kraut had picked them for a steal when the 
local Service Merchandise had gone out of business years ago.  Mueller 
was always bringing odd items home, stuff that had no apparent earthly 
purpose as far as his wife could see and no virtue other than it was 
dirt cheap.<br><br>Millie had long ago ceased asking, figuring that 
there were other husbands with stranger hobbies and worse vices.  And 
while she agreed with Kraut's politics (she was from Arkansas after all,
 and no one had despised Clinton more then she), Mueller figured he 
probably wouldn't tell her <span style="font-style: italic;">EVERYTHING </span>about
 what he had been up to this day.  Ignorance may not be bliss, but it 
sure can be functional occasionally in a marriage.  Especially when your
 husband was up to what Kraut was up to.  Mueller smiled, and wiped the 
sweat from his face and hands once more.<br><br>There were other 
projects he was working on, of course.  The improvised rifle grenade 
project he had dubbed "Project R".  It was the first to come to fruition
 because it was the easiest to accomplish.  His friend Bob was working 
on a related project, dubbed "P," in a remote farm machine shop in 
Shelby County.  Because it also involved shaped charges, most of what 
Kraut learned with P would be applied to R.  Bob was working on the 
launcher even now and he did not need the warhead to accomplish that.  
When both R and P were finished, they would devote all their energies to
 the most ambitious of their plans, "Project M."<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;">7 November: <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfaust</span></span><br><br>"Show me what you've got," said Kraut.<br><br>Bob
 Smith smiled craftily, his dark eyes glittering, showing some of his 
Korean ancestry, and he flipped back the lid of the long, surplus 
Israeli rocket crate that rested on the folding table in the farm shop.<br><br>"OK,"
 he began by pulling the smaller of the three tubes out of the crate, 
"this is the original Panzerfaust 100 we got from Mike when he was in 
Germany.  I still can't believe you can buy this stuff at flea markets 
over there," he said shaking his head.  "Yeah, I know it doesn't have a 
warhead, but STILL . . ."  His voice trailed off, then he continued.<br><br>"I'm going to recap a little because it bears on some of the changes I made in the design.  As you know we chose the <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfaust</span>
 because it doesn't require the complex chemistry and safety issues 
involved in making rocket fuel like the bazooka, just black powder as a 
propellant.  Because of that, of course, the tube must be much stronger.
  The 100 was a step above the older, smaller <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfausts</span>,
 with a new firing tube with a two-stage propellant charge that weighed 
190 grams or 6.7 oz.  This gave it a projectile speed of about 60 meters
 per second, that's about 200 feet per second and a range of 100 meters,
 hence the designation.  The 100 was pretty much the last <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfaust</span>
 that made it into the hands of troops in any numbers, showing up first 
about the time of the Battle of the Bulge.  The tube length on this 
specimen is 110 cm, which strangely splits the difference between the 
two lengths I've found in the books.  It's got a tube diameter of 60 mm 
just like our early bazooka. That's 2.36 inches.  With the original 
projectile this weapon weighed about 7 kilos, or between 15 to 16 
pounds.  You can see the sights are creviced for ranges of 30, 60, 80 
and 150 meters and those flakes are what's left of the glow-paint night 
sights.  That last 150 meter notch is real optimistic even with 7 ounces
 of blackpowder throwing it.  Here you can see the arming and firing 
system with the lever that also serves as the rear sight.  This was an 
improvement over the earlier <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfausts.</span>"<br><br>Laying
 down the original German tube and extracting the second one from the 
case, he placed it beside the first.  Smith continued.  "Now here is our
 direct replica of the original sample."<br><br>"Wow," Kraut Mueller burst out, "They're identical!"<br><br>"Not quite," demurred Smith.<br><br>"You
 can see the differences here," he pointed, "here, and here.  But all in
 all they are perfect to sell to World War II Wehrmacht and Waffen SS 
re-enactors along with an originally-shaped blunt hardwood projectile 
painted to look like metal.  The projectile's inert and they're black 
powder, so they're not covered under any of the Feds crappy laws, yet.  
Until the ATF decides to shut down that hobby, we can sell them all day 
long and plow the profits back into making these."<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SHA8c8aI8rI/AAAAAAAAAxE/xV5UwOAyc3o/s1600-h/pzf100cut.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="07-improvised-munitions_files/pzf100cut.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219738436072174258" border="0"></a><br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SHA8v-iSQoI/AAAAAAAAAxM/kWysoCLCwzI/s1600-h/pzf150wproj.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="07-improvised-munitions_files/pzf150wproj.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219738763060724354" border="0"></a><br><br><br>Bob Smith reached into the case and pulled out the last tube.<br><br>"OK, this is a hybrid of what I learned by studying the <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfaust</span>
 100 and the documents that you gave me from the War Department ordnance
 studies done after World War II.  Basically, its a combination of 
features from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfaust</span> 
150 and 250 (which never got fielded) with the same tube as the 100, but
 reinforced with bands of steel strapping here, here, here, and here.  
These reinforcements ought to make the thing reusable for at least ten 
shots.  Like the original 150, we can increase the length of the 
projectile and the amount of black powder increments to give you more 
efficient flight, speed and accuracy than the original along with a much
 heavier charge which will punch more armor.  You will also note that we
 have replaced the cumbersome and hard to duplicate arming and firing 
system with the RPG style firing handle that the Germans finally got 
around to putting on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Panzerfaust</span> 250."<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SHA_Axofb8I/AAAAAAAAAxk/lnmr2xvj3jk/s1600-h/pzfvs.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="07-improvised-munitions_files/pzfvs.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219741250678124482" border="0"></a><br>When
 Bob halted his spiel to take a breath, Mark asked the younger man, "Why
 the reinforcements?  Why not use a bigger tube?  Seems like the 
reinforcements add to production time and cost."<br><br>Nodding, Smith 
answered, "We thought of that, but we couldn't lay our hands on seamless
 steel tubing of the proper dimensions. We also wanted to maintain a 
heavy projectile throw weight."<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_iIgGzjVNEAk/SHA-avO3p7I/AAAAAAAAAxU/iDvVUmKhRfk/s1600-h/pzf+proj.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="07-improvised-munitions_files/pzfproj.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219740597198759858" border="0"></a>"How heavy is that?" Mark asked.<br><br>Bob told him.<br><br>"Damn!  That's good!"<br><br>"Yeah,
 its a couple orders of magnitude better than what we can get with a 
rifle grenade thrown by an itty-bitty 7.62 NATO grenade blank."<br><br>Kraut Mueller's brain swam with the possibilities.<br><br>Bob
 Smith reached behind the box and pulled out a shorter but fatter 
object. "And here's a sample projectile we turned out with round bar 
stock, sheet metal and some hardware.  You can see the cavity in the 
base for the secondary 'booster' charge of black powder, and the 
fabrication process facilitates loading the warhead."<br><br>He pulled 
off the hollow warhead shell with a simple twist.  "All you've got to do
 is design a projectile that works, Herr Dok-tor."<br><br>They looked at each other and both burst out laughing.<br><br>"Ya
 done good, Bob," Mark Mueller said appreciatively.  "When I had this 
hare-brained idea I didn't know if it would work or not.  I mean the 
black powder solved the rocket fuel questions, but, darn, you really did
 it well."<br><br>Bob Smith continued to grin, "Well, if it doesn't work, you can take it out of my pay."<br><br>The machine shop rang with their laughter.<br><br>"Now all we gotta do," said Kraut Mueller as they both exited the shop, "is test the things."<br><br>"I'll let you shoot it first," said Bob.<br><br>"Reluctantly," he added.<br><br>"Thanks a bunch, Smith."<br><br>Kraut paused, still laughing.<br><br>"Thanks a whole bunch."<br><br><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">18 November: "Hide yer Wimmin, Clinton's in Town!"</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">FBI - Office of the Special Agent in Charge<br>Birmingham, AL<br>2:47 P.M Central Standard Time.</span><br><br>"So
 what you're saying is this militia guy has operational rifle grenades 
and anti-tank weapons and despite constant surveillance which he's 
slipped past at least three times we can't figure out where he's hiding 
them?  Or where he makes them?"<br><br>The SAC was not pleased.  Not pleased at all.<br><br>"Hell,
 he's a damned old fat man who has congestive heart failure and limps 
with a cane.  My toddler could outrun him.  What's wrong with you 
people?"<br><br>The ASAC and the three field agents in the room looked 
uncomfortable and none of them met the SAC's gaze.  Two of them looked 
at the floor and one looked out the window.  The fourth stared at a 
point at least six feet above the SAC's head.<br><br>The ASAC cleared 
his throat.  "In fairness to the agents here, sir, this man is no 
ordinary person of interest.  He knows fieldcraft.  I called up Barney 
Williams, you remember sir, the special agent who retired just after you
 came here."<br><br>The SAC's face betrayed neither emotion nor understanding.<br><br>"Anyway,
 sir, he said they had the same trouble when they were trying to trail 
him back in the Clinton years.  Barney said the guy drove like a bank 
getaway man and had a great many friends to help him with diversions 
when he needed them.  He's got the electronics to scan for the latest 
bugs and he's very, very careful about his communications.  He seems to 
communicate through both dead and live drops all over the place, but we 
can't catch him at it.   If it weren't for the Confidential Informant, 
we wouldn't have known about the testing at all."<br><br>The ASAC ran down like a wind-up toy, waiting for the SAC to buy, or reject, his excuse.<br><br>The SAC said nothing, staring very intently at a pencil on his desk.<br><br>The
 ASAC ventured another factoid.  "Sir, Williams also said that this guy 
suckered both us and the ATF in the Nineties.  He would pretend to 
discuss illegal stuff on the phone just to sucker us into wasting our 
time chasing Tinkerbelles through NeverNever Land.  Barney said he 
suckered the ATF into firing the company that cleaned the building 
because he convinced them in a wiretap that janitors were going to put 
brown recluse spiders in the raid gear in their lockers to bite their 
dicks and make them fall off."<br><br>Two of the field agents snickered.<br><br>The SAC looked up.  "You're shitting me," he said flatly.<br><br>"No sir, I said the same thing and Barney swore it was true."<br><br>The SAC went back to looking at his pencil.  "Fieldcraft?  Where did he learn that, do we know?"<br><br>"No
 sir, he was a commie back in the 70s when he was young -- a secret 
member of a Maoist party, the Progressive Labor faction or something.  
Maybe he learned it then."<br><br>The SAC deigned to look up again, "A communist?  What kind of sense does that make?"<br><br>"Sir,
 he had some sort of epiphany right afterward.  He converted to 
Christianity and turned hard right and has been there ever since.  It's 
in his file, he's not shy of talking about it."<br><br>The SAC seemed to
 see the file in front of him for the very first time.  It was a thick 
one, he noted, a very thick one.  He flipped it open and an old polaroid
 clipped to the inside front flew off and landed at the edge of his desk
 top.  Reaching out, he retreived it and saw a portly middle aged man 
standing, no, posing, by the tailgate of his pick-up truck.  A huge sign
 covered it, and the man was smiling broadly.<br><br>"What the hell?"<br><br>The
 ASAC, who was familiar with the file, interjected, "Sir, that was taken
 in the late Nineties when the President came to Birmingham to tour the 
tornado damage west of town.  The Secret Service actually stopped him on
 the street and asked to take a picture of him and his pick-up truck.  
They took several polaroids and we asked for one, according to the 
notes.  As I said, he has a sense of humor.  I think the Secret Service 
guys did too.  They didn't much care for guarding that President and his
 wife."<br><br>"Yes," said the SAC, "I was alive in the Nineties, Mr. Baird."  He shook his head and chuckled in spite of himself.<br><br>The sign said, in huge letters, "Hide Yer Wimmin, Clinton's In Town!"<br><br>"So,"
 the SAC concluded, "We have a dangerous, funny old fat man who's dying 
of congestive heart failure but not fast enough to suit the new 
administration.  A man who has a gift for blarney and who may or may not
 have destructive devices capable of blowing up vehicles and small 
buildings?"<br><br>"Yes, sir," agreed the ASAC, "that's about it."<br><br>"Could he be working the CI back on us to make us do something stupid?"<br><br>The ASAC thought for a moment.  "Yes, sir, he could be."<br><br>"And
 are we certain of the CI?  What are his motives?  Is he being paid?  Is
 he being paid enough?  Enough not to double-agent on us?"<br><br>The ASAC didn't know and didn't want to admit that he didn't know. The control agent was meeting with the CI right now.<br><br>"Sir, I . . ."<br><br>"Well,
 find out, dammit.  The ATF's on me to let them have him as part of some
 big deal case they're working, as if screwing up the Gordon thing 
wasn't enough they think they got to take on this guy and his 
considerable number of friends.  But the Hoover Building says no.  Not 
just no, but hell no.  There's something about this particular guy that 
they want us to handle.  OK, so handle it, Mr. Baird!" <br><br>He looked around the room, "And you clowns better not lose him again."<br><br>They all mumbled yes, sirs, and turned to leave.  "And Baird," he added.<br><br>"Yes sir?"<br><br>"I want a full briefing on that CI before I go home today."<br><br>"Yes, sir," the ASAC said as he closed the door on the way out.<br><br>The SAC shifted his gaze to the window and the world outside.<br><br>"Shit," he muttered.<br><br>What was so special about this guy that the Director was personally interested in keeping him out of the hands of the ATF?<br><br>He didn't know, but he intended to find out.<p></p>

							<p>Solid rockets aren't as big of a deal as you might think.  
I've found this interesting reading, as I'm building a story along 
similar lines.  Of course, I can't help but try to fit in the Second 
Coming, Furries, and aliens and spaceships.  It'll be fun though.</p>

							<p>Meant to say PEX tubing, not PET. Checked at my local home 
store today.  The largest size commonly available is 1 inch inner 
diameter and appears to have a wall thickness of around 1/8th inch.  
Larger sizes can be special ordered, but 1 inch when split and flattened
 would be just over 3 inches wide which should be plenty.  It might need
 ironing or be run through a pants press to flatten the curve.<br><br>If
 PEX works for this it might also be useful for body armor - perhaps 
layered strips in the style of the Roman Lorica Segmenta or riveted to a
 cloth backing like medieval brigandine.</p>

							<p>Japanese armor was designed to overlap, providing a double layer over most of the surface.<br><br>I've
 said before that with modern materials tech, we've come back around the
 circle to where armor can match the weapons of the day, much like plate
 and swords were before the gun came along.  You could recreate the old 
knight anew, an expensive suit of armor that can stop just about 
anything man-portable, possibly even blast to some extent.  This would 
take you back to the question of how heavy the armor gets, and how heavy
 the gun has to be, and which one is easier/lighter/more effective?</p>

							<p>Dragon Skin<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Skin_body_armor<br><br>A
 full military tac vest with this stuff is a bit heavy, I've worn one.  
But it's not as heavy as steel or ceramic plate and has better coverage.<br><br>It will stop a rifle round and is available to civilians.</p>

							<p>I know this comment is coming several months after the others, but I felt a correction was needed.<br><br>Dragon
 Skin is not available for civilian purchase.  They will sell it to 
contractors who work for a security company, such as Blackwater, or any 
other.<br><br>But, Pinnacle Armor will not sell Dragon Skin to regular civilians such as myself.</p>

							<p>Trauma plates are also good for reinforcing vehicles from small-arms fire.<br><br>The engine, the cab, the fuel tank, and the trailers, if you are working with trucks require the most vital attention.<br><br>Plates
 used on vehicles can be attached using samurai style overlapping for 
greatest effectiveness against anything up to a .338 Lapua, and they 
don't contribute that much to the vehicle's gross weight, as compared to
 Chobham or other style of professional armor.</p>

							<p>Look the formula for Rocket Candy up on line. It can be used 
to launch a rocket very high, I think it would also be good for a RPG 
round. <br>If you can get Potassium Nitrate, you can make it. <br>You could even make the Potassium Nitrate, as the directions for making it are also on line.</p>
