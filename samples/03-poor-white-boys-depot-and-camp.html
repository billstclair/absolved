 Note: I first heard the tale of the wayward boxcar back in the late 
Eighties. Whether it was true or not I cannot say, but I know there were
 folks up in Winston County who believed it. What happened to it, and 
most importantly where it's contents are today is anybody's guess. I 
suppose some folks know, but they're not talkin'. You never can tell, 
though. We may yet see some items off that boxcar's bill of lading, if 
push comes to shove. In the hills of red-dirt-poor Winston County, 
nothing goes to waste, and they hardly ever throw anything useful away.

 was Monday and James Boatwright was late. He was late and he was cold. 
It was 19 degrees and he was chilled to the bone, and not just from the 
winter weather. As he hurried across Broad Street dodging traffic he 
slipped on the ice and almost ended up under a passing Ford cargo truck.
 The military policeman at the Broad Street Gate was laughing as James 
recovered and slipped-slid through the crusty brown slush at the curb. 
Boatwright ignored the MP and rushed through the gate, running as fast 
as the snow and his worn-out shoes would allow until he launched himself
 into the Intra-Depot Bus just as it was pulling out of “D” stop in 
front of the Depot headquarters building.<br><br>Had the MP not 
recognized him and allowed him to pass without checking his ID, 
Boatwright would have never made it to his desk on time. But the MP had 
been working his post for about three months now, and he knew Boatwright
 to be one of the many department managers of the busy Columbus Army 
Service Forces Depot. In fact, though the MP did not know it, James 
Boatwright was one of a few of the Depot’s 14,000 man (and woman) 
workforce whose seniority predated the war.<br><br>Built in 1918 on 281 
acres of swamp &amp; farm land well east of downtown Columbus, Ohio, the
 Columbus Quartermaster Reserve Depot was well-sited to take advantage 
of three major railroad lines. By the end of “The War to End All Wars”, 
the Depot had expanded to 25 warehouses. Most of these were dismantled 
after the war ended, and during the Twenties the Depot’s mission became 
reconditioning war materiel for resale.<br><br>Renamed in 1930 as the 
Columbus General Depot, it was used during the Thirties as the District 
Headquarters for the “Triple Cs”—the Civilian Conservation Corps—for 
Ohio and West Virginia. Thus it was to the Columbus General Depot that 
in 1933, James Boatwright, hat in hand, applied for a floor sweeper’s 
job. The fact that James was a veteran of the “Great War” helped him 
secure his position, as did the fact that his uncle had worked at the 
Depot since the groundbreaking in May, 1918.<br><br>If he ever felt 
guilty about using his family connection to get a job, James didn’t 
remember it. It was the “Great Depression” and his family was just short
 of eviction. Being hired by the Depot was the best thing that could 
have happened at the time, and certainly James had repaid his employers,
 the taxpayers of the United States of America, with years of diligent 
hard work. When he had time to think about it (which wasn’t often), 
James wondered if the current “Great War” would be followed by another 
depression. “I suppose we’ll have to start numbering the depressions 
like we number the world wars now,” James had grumbled to his wife just 
last week.<br><br>Then came Pearl Harbor, and the Depot workers knew 
they would be called upon to support the war effort just like 1918. They
 had no idea, however, how large a task they would be asked to perform. 
It was a bigger war, with many fronts, and the demands of the services 
for arms and materiel were huge and insatiable. The Depot grew, and grew
 again, buildings multiplying at a ferocious pace. In August, 1942, the 
Quartermaster General took over the Depot and it was renamed the 
Columbus Quartermaster Depot. In this war, the Depot would support all 
the services, not just the Army. Later that year, another 295 acres were
 purchased and the building went on and on: more vast sheds, more rail 
sidings, more offices to handle the workload: Salvage Office, Lumber 
Office, Motor Maintenance, even Chemical Warfare. In 1943, its named had
 been changed yet again to the Columbus Army Service Forces Depot, but 
to everyone who worked there it had always been, and would always be, 
simply called “The Depot.”<br><br>Over 14,000 war workers now bustled 
across the Depot’s nearly 600 acres at all hours every day, and some of 
them were prisoners of war. James never felt comfortable having POWs 
doing critical war work. It was all very well to use them on the farms 
growing grain and such. How much sabotage could they do there? But here,
 at the Depot, with vast quantities of munitions passing through there 
were unlimited opportunities for criminal mischief. Oh, the Italians 
were trustworthy enough, James reflected. Once beaten, they stayed 
beaten and were more docile and agreeable than the native Americans who 
worked at the Depot. But the Germans…..well, James Boatwright hadn’t 
trusted a German since 1918 and he wasn’t about to start. He kept a 
vigilant eye on the Germans in his immediate area and he constantly 
urged his supervisors and lead men to do the same. There hadn’t been a 
case of sabotage in his area that he knew of, and there wouldn’t be if 
he could make sure that the Germans were carefully watched. Not that the
 Germans, or anyone else, had spare time to think up mischief. They were
 too busy.<br><br>Five thousand rail cars entered and left the Depot 
every month. John Carmody, a friend of James’ who kept track of such 
statistics from his office up front in the headquarters building, said 
that if all the cars were put end to end, by the end of the year they 
would form a train well over a thousand miles long. In February 1943 
alone the Depot had shipped over 53,000 tons of guns, ammunition and 
other ordnance supplies to the far-flung battlefronts. Carmody also told
 Boatwright that the Quartermaster Section was shipping about ONE 
HUNDRED MILLION field ration meals a month. From fresh meat to 
antiaircraft guns, from clothing to bridge sections, from jeeps and 
trucks to medical supplies, the Depot took it in, inspected it, 
repackaged it, selected it, and shipped it on to its ultimate 
destination: the biggest war the world had ever seen.<br><br>On the wall
 next to his desk was a clipping from the Depot newsletter, “The Log of 
Columbus.” Almost two years old now, it read: “The gigantic task in 
which all of us are engaged to bring freedom again to the nations of the
 world has been aptly called a war of supply. Never before has so much 
depended on keeping the tools of war moving to the fighting fronts. This
 Depot is one of the most important links in the chain of supply.” James
 kept the small clipping as his own little war poster, for he believed 
every word of it.<br><br>Even before the war, the President had called 
the United States “the arsenal of democracy.” Looking out the bus window
 as he passed by the long sheds full to bursting, crated antiaircraft 
guns and searchlights sitting in the open storage areas and forklifts 
rushing to and fro, James Boatwright knew he was looking at just a small
 portion of that arsenal. He was proud of the job he did, even if at the
 moment he had no business doing it.<br><br>James Boatwright was sick. 
The flu had been going around, and James had caught a piece of it. His 
temperature at the moment was about a hundred and two. He had 
alternately chilled and burned for two days now. His wife had not wanted
 him to go to work today, but he felt he had to. Not that today was any 
more important than any other day but merely because he knew that his 
sons, and a lot of other fathers’ sons, were counting on the supplies 
that would move through the Depot this day. James wanted to make sure 
that his part was done right. And there wasn’t one of his subordinates 
he could trust to keep an eye on all the many facets of his job.<br><br>So
 when he made it to his desk, he hung up his hat and overcoat, put his 
lunchbox on the shelf and began to organize his day. First he had to 
clean up the mess. Over the weekend someone, probably that 4F kid Jimmy 
McKnight, had been using his desk as a combination dinner table and 
library reading room kiosk. There were crumbs everywhere. (Was that 
mayonnaise on his telephone handset?) Spread out across his desk was 
Saturday’s edition of the Columbus Evening Dispatch. James didn’t mind 
someone using his desk, but he darned sure wished they had the manners 
to clean up after themselves. Well, there was a war on, right? Standards
 slipped in wartime, that was a given, so James merely sighed and began 
to sweep the crumbs into his wastebasket.<br><br>The newspaper drew 
Boatright’s attention. He’d been too sick to read the paper the last 
couple of days and this was still news to him.<br><br>“REDS 204 MILES 
FROM BERLIN” screamed the headline in the Dispatch. “Five Red Armies 
Strike Nazis; Reich Invaded at Three Points,” read the next line. 
“Simple Ceremony Marks 4th Term Inauguration,” said a lesser headline in
 the upper left corner, below which was a picture of the President being
 sworn in by Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone. James sighed. Well, I didn’t
 vote for him, he thought.<br><br>Mr. Boatwright had drummed a practical
 knowledge of the history of American constitutional jurisprudence into 
his son’s head to supplement James’ Catholic school education. And Mr. 
Roosevelt (his father had referred to him as “THAT man,” until the day 
he died in 1937) had bent the Constitution into a pretzel to accomplish 
his “New Deal”, even going so far as to threaten to pack the Supreme 
Court to coerce the justices into getting what he wanted. Many Americans
 thought Roosevelt to be a deity only slightly lesser than Jesus Christ.
 James had a different opinion. It was, however, a minority opinion. 
Well, that’s democracy for you, James thought.<br><br>“Torpedoed Ship’s 
Crew Strafed by Japanese,” read the headline just above the fold. Just 
to the right of that tragedy was a story that caught James attention:<br><br>“Canadian Draftees Revealed AWOL”<br>“Ottawa, January 20 (AP) –<br>Half
 of a group of Canadian home defense soldiers drafted for overseas 
service went absent without leave before embarkation, and 6300 are still
 at large, Defense Minister A.G.L. McNaughton disclosed today. Some 1500
 of these 7800 returned voluntarily or were apprehended, he added, and 
about 500 of them sailed for Britain along with the others who did not 
take authorized leaves….the 6300 will be classed as deserters if they do
 not return within 21 days.”<br><br>Boatwright snorted in derision. 
Canucks. That figured. Such behavior squared with his own experiences 
with Canadians in the First World War. Shaking his head, his eyes 
scanned on down to “Casualties in Central Ohio”. “Ah, blessed Heavenly 
Father, there’s little Vic,” James whispered.<br><br>“KILLED IN ACTION”<br>“Columbus -- Sea. 1c Enio John Centurini, 23, E. 3rd Ave, in the Pacific; Cpl. Victor R. Lake, 25, 2481 James Road, in Germany.”<br><br>It
 wasn’t news to James, of course. The Lakes lived two doors down from 
the Boatwrights and Mrs. Lake had received the telegram over a week ago.
 The government always delayed the press release of casualties so the 
families wouldn’t suffer the shock of reading about it in the papers the
 same time as their neighbors. Still, occasionally the telegram didn’t 
get delivered to the right person and there was more than one father or 
mother or wife who read about the death of their little Jimmy or beloved
 Johnny over morning coffee.<br><br>What a waste, James thought. Another
 marvelous boy cut down in the spring of life, one of millions of such 
boys all over the world. Ah, God in Heaven, what a waste. All because of
 the murderous greedy bastards who start the dirty stinking wars. The 
fires of Hell weren’t hot enough for Hitler, Tojo and Mussolini. 
Stinking bastards. May they meet their Maker swiftly.<br><br>The war was
 close to being over. That much was clear from the headlines. We were 
going to win the war, the only question uppermost in James’ mind was how
 many American boys lives would be required to end it, and would one or 
more of his three sons be among the fallen?<br><br>Hitler’s last gasp 
had been that Battle of the Bulge thing. Surely that WAS his last gasp. 
He couldn’t have another surprise like that up his sleeve, could he? But
 then there were the Japs. One look at the map told you that they still 
were in a lot of places they had to pried out of, and we hadn’t even got
 close to the home islands yet. How horrific was that going to be?<br><br>“Jap
 Resistance Mounts in Fury In Luzon Fight.” Now this story drew James 
Boatwright’s full attention. James’ son Billy was a sergeant in the 37th
 “Buckeye” Division. And the Boatwrights hadn’t had a letter from Billy 
since last month.<br><br>“Tank Battles and Artillery Duels Flare Along Invasion Front” James read on down the column.<br><br>“Sisson
 was captured after a nerve-wracking night in which Japanese pressed the
 attack incessantly against American infantry and anti-tank guns pinned 
down by artillery firing from overlooking ridges. As soon as the 
Japanese armor withdrew, screaming Nipponese foot soldiers charged. They
 were beaten off with losses to both sides…. Similar tank and Banzai 
charges were reported elsewhere in the sector, where Japanese were 
burned out of 20 foot holes by flame-throwers….”<br><br>James stopped 
reading. Flame-throwers. Wasn’t there something from last week about 
flame-throwers? Some unfinished business, he half-remembered. He 
discarded the newspaper into his trashcan, and began to survey his desk 
seriously for the first time. Rifling through his pending basket, he 
found it. There was a shipping order for twelve M2-2 flamethrowers. 
Let’s see, James scanned the attached note. Ah, that was it. James rose 
and walked out his office door into the bedlam beyond. Scanning the 
frantic activity, he spied the man he was looking for corking off by the
 water cooler, trying to make time with Betsy Sillers. James grinned. 
Sillers wouldn’t give Chief Cooper McCarthy the time of day if he was 
the last man on earth. Betsy had sense.<br><br>“McCarthy! Come here for a second!” he yelled.<br><br>McCarthy,
 a hard-drinking Irishman with an uncommonly big beer belly, danced 
across the shed runway, dodging a passing forklift. When he got within 
earshot he said, “Yeah. Boss?”<br><br>“Did you get those flame-throwers re-crated for shipment?” Boatwright asked.<br><br>“Uh, what flame-throwers?” McCarthy feigned ignorance.<br><br>“You know damned well which flame-throwers, McCarthy. The ones I talked to you about twice on Saturday.”<br><br>James
 didn’t wait for a reply. “Now get your ass over to Shed 11 and get them
 ready before I send you to the paymaster to pick up your last check.”<br><br>Boatwright
 executed an about face and went back into his office, leaving the Chief
 Cooper spluttering what little he remembered of his father’s Gaelic 
curses.<br><br>One of James Boatwright’s principal duties was the 
supervision of the Freight Consolation station. Shipments from all the 
various sections of the Depot that were less than a carload were brought
 to the FC station in the south end of Building 12. There it was sorted 
and consolidated to get the economical benefit of shipping in full 
carloads. Those flame-throwers that William O’Rourke McCarthy had been 
goldbricking on were all that was needed to fill out a railcar going to 
the port of Oakland where ships were destined for various points in the 
Pacific theater. And that shipment needed to leave today, if possible.<br><br>James scanned down the consolidated bill of lading, which contained some unusual items:<br><br>2
 M55 Quad Fifty Caliber anti-aircraft machine gun trailer mounts, 
complete with 200,000 rounds of .50 caliber belted ammunition, ball, 
tracer, and armor piercing incendiary, as well as extra gun-mounted ammo
 cans and spare barrels; 4 of the new M20 75mm Recoilless Rifles, tripod
 mounted complete with direct fire sights plus 400 rounds of 75mm armor 
piercing and high explosive ammunition…<br><br>James guessed the first 
two items were “packaged” so they could go into immediate action. 
Although the destinations were different, they were probably both 
intended for the Philippine theater.<br><br>Then there was another big 
package. It consisted of 200 M3 .45 caliber submachine guns with 2,000 
magazines and 120,000 rounds of .45 caliber ball; 200 of the new M2 
Carbines with 2,000 magazines and 120,000 rounds of .30 Carbine ball 
ammunition; 100 M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifles with 1200 magazines; 
100 M1903A3 rifles with grenade launching attachments and crates of high
 explosive, white phosphorus and antitank rifle grenades with launching 
cartridges; there were even more crates of Mark II hand grenades. For 
the Springfields and BARs there were 240,000 rounds of M2 ball 
ammunition packed in bandoleers and 5 round stripper clips. In addition,
 there were boxes of web belts and ammunition pouches of the appropriate
 types for all the weapons, in matching quantities going to the same 
address.<br><br>These had to be intended for some guerrilla group in 
Asia, thought Boatwright. Almost all shipments to U.S. military units 
were not bundled like this. They would ship whole boxcar loads of arms, 
other boxcar loads of ammo, and most often these would be shipped direct
 from the manufacturers or arsenals which produced them. But there were 
plenty of places that the Japanese still held, and these items looked 
like they were packaged to enable them to be re-bundled without delay 
and dropped behind enemy lines. James had seen packages like this 
before, going to the ETO. (In fact, although Boatwright never knew it, 
those arms had been dropped to the French Maquis by the OSS. This 
package was intended for a particularly effective anti-Japanese partisan
 group in French Indochina which the OSS had been working with for some 
time. Its leader was a little Communist named Ho Chi Minh.)<br><br>Then there was another line item that, like the 75mm Recoilless Rifles, James had never seen before.<br><br>There
 were 20 M3 “grease guns” like the others in the “package” but these 
were being shipped with sound suppressors. Hmm, thought James, 
silencers. No magazines or ammo were included with this shipment so 
presumably the recipients would already have both.<br><br>And of course 
there were the twelve M2-2 flame throwers and 24 refill tanks, as well 
as organizational support maintenance kits. No fuel of course, that 
would be available wherever these were going. Sergeant Billy Boatwright 
had written his father about watching GIs of his division using these 
devil’s backpacks on Jap pillboxes on Bougainville in March of last 
year. James shuddered to think of the sights his youngest son had seen. 
His own war had been terrible enough, but he suspected, no, he knew, 
that the scientific ingenuity of man had made this war even worse.<br><br>There
 were more light items: bales of uniforms, anti-flash garments and hoods
 for naval gunners, aircraft carrier deck signal paddles, pith helmets, 
mosquito netting and MP brassards as well as ping pong balls and paddles
 headed for some USO or hospital. All of it was destined for the Port of
 Oakland. James checked the total weight of the cargo, plus the space 
calculations. Yes, it was not too much over the 100.000 pound maximum 
gross for the 50’6” long car (as measured internally) and the stuff 
would fit with some backing and filling by the POWs. (There was a time 
when James would have never considered loading a railcar more than the 
max, but this was war and there was a continual shortage of boxcars.) 
The balance would have to be right, not too much on one side of the car 
or the other. But the German POWs were usually pretty good at that, 
better than most of the Americans on the loading crew who worked the 
forklifts.<br><br>The POWs. James Boatwright grimaced. They would bear 
watching with this one. Give one unattended POW a minute to fool with a 
case of hand grenades and it could be Armageddon on his loading dock. He
 would watch this one himself.<br><br>By the time McCarthy came back 
with the re-crated flame throwers (and it was record time for him), the 
loading of the railroad car was well under way, all under the watchful 
eye of James Boatwright. There was some trouble with the balance, but 
after taking some items off and rearranging them, it finally worked. 
They were just about to fit the last items in by hand when James 
Boatwright passed out and hit the dock floor as if he’d been pole-axed.<br><br>The
 Depot medics were summoned and, with the assistance of the American 
lead man and his helper, carried James to the ambulance. Someone yelled 
at the POWs to “hurry up and finish the job goddammit!” In went the last
 boxes and the door was sealed.<br><br>In the confusion, no one noticed 
Feldwebel Helmut Grass switch the bills of lading on the outside of the 
car with the next one up the track.<br><br>Helmut, recently of the 252nd
 Panzer Grenadiers, had been waiting for such a moment for three months,
 ever since he had been posted to the Depot. According to the Geneva 
Convention, POWs weren’t supposed to be employed in war work but Helmut 
didn’t mind. He figured (quite correctly) that Germany probably had 
American POWs doing war work back home, and besides, he thought that the
 job would give him ample opportunity to help the Fuhrer and the 
Fatherland by engaging in a little sabotage.<br><br>Raised in the Hitler
 Youth, Helmut was a big believer in the Fuhrer and the Fatherland. He 
liked to think he had remained faithful to his blood oath even after he 
was captured in Normandy. Even so, by the date of his capture on June 
13, 1944, Helmut’s military ardor had cooled considerably. In fact, he 
had been hysterically happy to be captured. Flattened in a roadside 
ditch, he had pissed himself in fear while the P47 “Jabos” worked over 
his unit’s convoy with bombs and machineguns, again and again until the 
stench of roasting flesh made him puke his last three breakfasts. He was
 still hiding there two days later when an advancing American infantry 
unit scooped him up. Helmut was too demoralized to resist. Even now he 
dreamed every night of the smell of roasting flesh. He could still smell
 it. Sometimes he dreamed the flesh was his. On those nights he woke up 
screaming to find his mattress soaked with sweat and urine. His 
continual shame made him an even bigger Nazi in the POW barracks than he
 had been in the Hitler Youth.<br><br>As for sabotage, Helmut had been 
sorely disappointed. He was too closely watched during his service at 
the Depot to as much as spit in the “Amis’” coffee. His best opportunity
 had been today. “25 Grenades, Hand, TNT Frag, MK.2 with fuze” read the 
crates that Helmut had helped position in the car. “Grenade” meant 
pretty much the same thing in several languages and Helmut understood 
exactly what was in those crates, but every time he looked up there was 
that verdammt American supervisor staring back at him, looking for all 
the world like a hawk about to sink its talons into a field mouse if it 
so much as twitched.<br><br>When Boatwright had collapsed and the rest 
of the crew was distracted, Helmut seized the chance to do the only 
thing he could think of to wreck the American war effort: he switched 
bills with another railcar that the crew had earlier loaded with 
clothing. If he could not destroy the cargo, he could at least send it 
where it was not needed. He was exultant. He had struck a blow for 
Fuhrer and Fatherland. He had in some small measure begun to atone for 
puking and pissing in fear at the bottom of that French ditch.<br><br>Helmut
 watched as the American assigned to document the loading matched the 
wrong bill of lading with railcar’s number. As the crew went on to 
loading the next car, he began to hum the “Horst Wessel Song.” His 
fellow POWs looked at him like he was crazy, which of course he was.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">February 2, 1945: The Camp</span><br><br>It
 was a Friday afternoon in the warmest February Bill Hackney could 
remember, but then Bill was a native of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, not 
Aliceville, Alabama. A lumberjack by profession and a family man, Bill 
had initially been spared the draft. As a lumberjack he plied a trade 
that was ruled to be essential to the war effort, for everything that 
the “arsenal of democracy” turned out was shipped in wooden crates, 
lashed to wooden pallets, loaded onto wooden box cars, transported to 
wooden warehouses, and handled by men who slept in wooden barracks.<br><br>But
 in July, 1944, Bill’s wife told him she had fallen in love with a 
discharged soldier, a local fellow who had come home minus his right leg
 below the knee after an encounter with a Jap knee mortar on New Guinea.
 She wanted a divorce. It was crazy, but Bill figured maybe he could 
save his marriage by becoming a soldier himself. If she wanted a 
soldier, then a soldier he would become. He went down to the recruiting 
office and signed the papers. She laughed when he told her. Fortunately 
the kids were upstairs sleeping. He slapped her face so hard it spun her
 around and dumped her on her butt on the kitchen floor. She wasn’t 
laughing when he walked out the door. But then, he wasn’t either. It was
 the first time he’d ever touched her in anger, and though she’d 
deserved it, he wasn’t proud of it.<br><br>Well, at least boot camp kept
 him so busy he barely had time for the memory to rankle during the day.
 The long nights were different, though. He had plenty of lonely, ugly 
thoughts then. With all the war news of casualties, casualties and more 
casualties, Bill figured he’d end up in a mattress cover six feet deep 
somewhere in France or maybe on some Central Pacific hellhole. So he was
 surprised when God smiled on him and he drew an assignment to the 305th
 Military Police Escort Guard Company stationed at the Aliceville POW 
Internment Camp.<br><br>Located close to the railroad junction in 
Aliceville, Alabama, the camp had been built by the Blair Construction 
Company of Montgomery, Alabama and was opened for business on June 2, 
1943 when the first prisoners arrived by train at the end of a long 
journey that had begun at El Alamein. The camp consisted of more than 
400 buildings, employed more than 1200 military and civilian personnel 
and housed over 6000 German and Italian POWs.<br><br>Throughout 1943 and
 1944, the original complement grew with new arrivals from Sicily, 
Italy, France and Holland. Prisoners were employed mostly as 
agricultural laborers at local farms, and there hadn’t been an escape 
attempt since August, 1943, when a couple of Nazi fanatics had managed 
to get themselves shot trying to get through the wire. Why they didn’t 
walk away from a work detail when they were already miles away from the 
camp was a mystery to guards and prisoners alike, but then as Sergeant 
Wilkie put it, “Well, ya gotta be pretty fricking stupid to be a Nazi 
anyways.”<br><br>Most of the prisoners figured they were pretty 
fortunate to be sitting the war out in safety rather than fighting in 
some doomed last ditch ‘kessel’ on the Eastern Front. Of course even if 
they had escaped, where would they go? Mexico? That might be an option 
for somebody interned in say, Arizona. (There had been rumors of a 
successful escape from a camp in that state.) But Alabama? You would 
have to be wire happy to try. Not that there weren’t soldaten who didn’t
 go nuts behind the wire. The camp hospital had its own mental ward, and
 occasionally a suicide was found hanging by a knotted bed sheet from an
 overhead pipe or rafter.<br><br>Hackney also had heard the rumors that 
every now and then some POW would make an unflattering comment about the
 Fuhrer and end up as an “unexplained death.” The American camp 
commander wasn’t too fussy about autopsies in such cases and if the 
Nazis still held sway in some of the tar-paper barracks there wasn’t 
much the 305th MPEG Company could do about it. Gerald Stabler, the mayor
 of Aliceville and the town undertaker still got the business generated 
thereby, for which services the U.S. Army reimbursed him, if not very 
handsomely.<br><br>But if the POWs didn’t talk much politics or religion
 to the guards or each other, they were scrupulous about keeping to the 
rules when outside the wire on work details. It wasn’t uncommon for the 
MP guard to take the two shotgun shells he was issued out of his weapon,
 sit down with his back up against a tree and go to sleep with the 
twelve gauge across his legs. When the work was done, one of the Krauts 
would gently wake him, and back to the camp they would go.<br><br>For 
their part, the guards never mistreated the prisoners (unlike some 
camps) and some became fast friends with POWs, although it was against 
the rules. The townsfolk had lined the streets and gaped at the 
prisoners when they first marched from the railroad station in 1943. 
(“As if we had horns and a tail,” one prisoner had told Hackney.) But 
now, almost two years later, some of them would invite POWs into their 
kitchens on a hot day and give them lemonade. Both MPs and POWs agreed 
there were worse places than Aliceville, Alabama to serve out the war.<br><br>But
 at the moment, Private First Class William J. Hackney had a problem. In
 fact, he had a big problem. The problem was a railroad car that should 
have been loaded with the winter clothing issue for 6000 men. But when 
Hackney had broken the door seal on the car and the POWs had pulled open
 the door, instead of courdoroy pants and cotton shirts with “PW” strips
 sewn on them there were crates of ammunition. Instead of standard issue
 PW overcoats there were hand grenades. Hand grenades! Plus Lord alone 
knows what behind that! Hackney had followed orders and brought a work 
detail to the siding to unload what was supposed to be a bunch of 
clothes. Now he had twenty German soldiers hanging around looking at 
crates of munitions that they quite certainly recalled how to use.<br><br>The
 first thing Bill did was to load his shotgun with his two puny little 
shells. They hardly seemed adequate for the occasion. Two shells divided
 by twenty Krauts: nope, Mrs. Hackney’s oldest son didn’t like the math 
at all. Bill didn’t see any of the more notorious camp Nazis in this 
bunch, but then, how do you tell a Nazi just by looking at him? He 
ordered the crew boss, Gunter Muller, to shut the door and move his work
 party away from the car a good twenty yards or so. He then told Gunter 
to send a man to summon Sergeant Wilkie. Gunter’s command of English was
 excellent and he complied with the commands instantly, barking out 
Hackney’s instructions in rapid-fire German. A “kreigie” went running 
down the siding to the supply office. Hackney moved in between the car 
and the Krauts. Gunter sensed how scared the Private was and ordered his
 men to sit down facing away from the siding.<br><br>“With your 
permission, Sir, I have instructed ze men to sit down,” said Gunter, 
maintaining his distance from both the rail car and the shotgun.<br><br>“Uh, yeah….Great, Gunter….Uh, and, thanks,” stammered Hackney.<br><br>Gunter nodded, once, and stood very still.<br><br>Like
 cavalry riding to the rescue, Sergeant First Class Walter “Wendell” 
Wilkie came barrelling down the track. “Hackney, what the hell is this 
Kraut all upset about?” demanded Wilkie, hooking his thumb back over his
 shoulder at the POW runner who followed him at a respectable distance.<br><br>“Uh,
 Sarge, we got us a SNAFU with this car. It don’t have our cargo in it, 
it’s got somebody else’s,” replied the Private First Class.<br><br>“All right, well get a couple of those Krauts to open her up so I can take a look,” ordered the Sergeant.<br><br>“Sarge,
 I don’t think that’s a good idea,” replied Hackney. He leaned toward 
Wilkie and whispered, “There’s ammo and grenades in that car and God 
knows what else. It’s packed to the gills!”<br><br>Sergeant Wilkie eyed Hackney suspiciously. “No shit?”<br><br>Hackney
 nodded vigorously. “No shit, Sarge. That’s why I had ‘em move away from
 it.” He added, “I think we oughta get that damned thing outta here 
pretty damned quick.”<br><br>“Private, that sounds like a damn fine 
idea,” agreed Wilkie. Unbuttoning the flap on his holster and touching 
the butt of his .45 in reassurance, the Sergeant eyed Muller and his 
crew. “OK, here’s how we’ll do it. You escort Gunter and the rest of 
them Krauts up to the headquarters building and pick up Corporal 
Zelenski on the way. Don’t let these guys outta your sight or let ‘em 
talk to anybody. You make sure Gunter keeps these mothers quiet. Tell 
Zelenski I said to keep these Krauts under guard and away from the rest 
of the camp until we get this car outta here. Tell him to get as many 
men as he needs from the interior guard to make that happen. When he’s 
got all the help he needs, tell him to send four more MPs with you back 
here, and tell ‘em to come with full magazines. And top off your shotgun
 too. You got that?”<br><br>Private First Class William J. Hackney nodded, “Yes, Sarge.”<br><br>“Repeat it back to me,” demanded the Sergeant.<br><br>Hackney
 did. As the Sergeant expected, Pfc. Hackney got the first part right, 
and most of the second part wrong. Wilkie repeated his instructions, and
 this time when the Pfc. repeated it, Hackney got it right.<br><br>“OK, then,” Wilkie ordered, “Get Gunter with the program and move ‘em off quick march. And come back here double time.”<br><br>“Right, Sarge,” said Hackney, adding, “I’ll be back with help as soon as I can.”<br><br>“You
 damn well better,” snapped the Sergeant, ‘or I’ll have you on permanent
 tower guard for the rest of the war. You’ll have to eat, sleep and shit
 up there.”<br><br>Hackney’s head bobbed up and down in agreement. All 
the guards hated tower duty. He turned and issued his orders to Gunter, 
repeating the instruction for absolute silence. Of course Gunter had 
heard the Sergeant’s orders himself and, unlike Pfc. Hackney, he had 
understood them correctly the first time. Gunter saluted, American 
style, did an about face and strode down the embankment to his crew who 
had remained seated with their backs to the railcar. Executing another 
about face, Gunter commanded them to rise and fall in. The POWs leaped 
to their feet, quickly sorting out a line.<br><br>Keeping a straight 
face, Gunter addressed them in German in a conversational tone: “OK, 
kameraden, these ‘Ami’ arschlocks are crapping bricks about what’s in 
that ‘wagen’. They want us to follow that frightened private ‘quick 
march’ to the headquarters building and to say nothing to anyone along 
the way. Follow me.”<br><br>With their backs to the Americans, the 
Germans grinned. There were no Nazis in this work party, just German 
soldiers trying to make it home. None of them wanted to be a dead hero. 
But the nervousness of the Americans reminded them that they were still 
‘Deustche soldaten’ and feared by their enemies. So they smiled as they 
faced right and marched in perfect step to the headquarters building, 
looking every bit the German soldiers they once had been and, in truth, 
still were.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">February 5, 1945: The Boxcar &amp; the Preacher’s Son</span><br><br>By
 Friday evening the crisis was over. A switch engine had been summoned 
from the small Aliceville yard and the boxcar had been moved away from 
the camp and re-secured with an Ordnance Department padlock. After it 
left the camp area, Gunter and his men were released to go back to their
 barracks. The unrepentant Nazis who secretly controlled the inner camp 
raged that such an opportunity for “making our own Second Front” had 
been lost. The rest of the POWs, including Gunter, thought them mad as 
hatters but said nothing. Despite their disappointment at being denied 
the opportunity for posthumous Knight’s Crosses, the Nazis praised 
Gunter for the way he had maintained the German military spirit in the 
face of the cowardly, frightened Americans. They reluctantly agreed that
 there had been little else Gunter could have done in the face of 
Sergeant Wilkie’s vigilance.<br><br>As far as the American army was 
concerned, the only thing left was the paperwork. Something had to be 
done about getting the boxcar back on the way to its correct 
destination. And someone had to find out “where in the pluperfect Hades”
 (to quote Captain Arliss who was a religious man and not disposed to 
profanity) the correct rail car full of the camp’s winter clothing issue
 was. On Monday morning, both of these jobs fell to First Sergeant 
Matthew Mark Luke, the NCO in charge of the 305th’s quartermaster and 
transportation office.<br><br>Now as one might suspect from his name, 
Matthew Mark Luke was the first-born son of a preacher. And like many a 
preacher’s son, Matt Luke was a rebellious young man when he was growing
 up. In fact, that was how he had come to be in the army. It had been a 
cold night in November, 1937, when the Winston County, Alabama, probate 
judge caught young Matt deflowering his fair daughter in the carriage 
house. (Well, in fact the young lady who was not yet of legal age had 
been deflowered previously more than once by others, but that was a fact
 that was both unknown to the judge at the time and immaterial in the 
heat of his rage.)<br><br>Matt Luke’s life was saved that night by four 
happy accidents. First, the judge had snatched up his pistol instead of 
his shotgun when he had gone in search of his daughter. Second, the 
sight of his young daughter screaming and leaping about “in flagrante 
delicto” (as the legal community calls it) and “buck nekkid” (as they 
say in Winston County) disconcerted the judge greatly and spoiled his 
aim. Third, the Lord had placed a window right above the equally nekkid 
Matthew M. Luke, thus facilitating his rapid egress from the scene. And 
last, but certainly not least, the judge was drunker than Cooter Brown 
and couldn’t have hit the broadside of the carriage house if his life 
depended on it.<br><br>The only thing the judge DID manage to hit in his
 fusillade was a coal oil lamp that promptly exploded all over the 
upholstery of the judge’s Model A Ford, which began to burn like the 
Devil himself had just returned it after taking it for a spin around the
 Lake of Fire. Thus in one night did the judge lose his Model A, his 
carriage house and his illusions about his daughter’s virtue. It is hard
 to say which loss hurt him worse, but the neighbors who knew him best 
thought he mourned most over the Model A.<br><br>As for Matthew, he 
paused only long enough after his unclothed run home through the 
backwoods of Winston County to do four things. He put tincture of iodine
 on his scratches (and some places hurt more than others). He jumped 
into a shirt, britches and shoes. He kissed his Momma goodbye. And he 
told her he was off to join the Army.<br><br>Army life suited Matthew 
Mark Luke. His sergeants were easier on him than his daddy had been. 
He’d been snapping to attention and saying “yessir” and “nossir” since 
he was two, which impressed the officers. Being a Winston County boy he 
could shoot straighter than most of his fellow soldiers, who were 
primarily sickly, cross-eyed city folk who’d never handled a rifle in 
their lives. Such martial competence always endears a young recruit to 
his drill sergeants. Better than that, he got to drink when off-duty and
 nobody yelled at him. He also got to debauch himself with willing young
 women and no one tried to shoot him. And lastly, and perhaps most 
importantly, he had a winning smile and wholesome good looks that 
allowed him to locate and acquire items for his fellow soldiers that 
they otherwise could not obtain. Matthew Mark Luke found a home in Army.<br><br>An
 army, especially an army in peacetime in a country in the middle of a 
depression, is a place defined by its scarcities. Private Matthew Mark 
Luke quickly came to understand that the supply clerk gets first dibs on
 anything that comes into the unit officially. He also understood 
intuitively that unofficially a supply clerk, especially a quick-witted 
supply clerk with a preacher-son’s nose for human frailties, can corrupt
 even the most straight laced officer or NCO if he can lay his hands on 
that man’s vice of choice. In view of future events, it probably would 
have been better for the good order and discipline of the Army if 
Matthew Mark Luke’s recruiting sergeant had met the Winston County 
probate judge before he signed the young man up. Unfortunately, future 
First Sergeant Matthew M. Luke did not introduce them. As a result, 
Parson Luke’s son got the best of the bargain.<br><br>By the time of 
Pearl Harbor four years later, Matt Luke had made Staff Sergeant in the 
Regular Army, a meteoric ascent in peacetime. He had accomplished this 
by bribing his officers and blackmailing his NCOs. He also ran the post 
betting pool and provided moonshine to the enlisted men (though he was 
so slick that the Provosts could never catch him). Considering that 
Prohibition had ended years before, this was no mean feat. He did it by 
undercutting everyone else’s prices and going directly to the distiller—
 who just happened to be his Uncle Curtis who lived up near Natural 
Bridge. Curtis Stampp (his Momma’s brother) had been a moonshiner all 
his life, as had his daddy and his daddy’s daddy before him. It was said
 that the Stampps had planted more terminally surprised “revenooers” in 
North Alabama than any other family. The Stampp family product was 
quality ‘shine that never made anybody blind or killed ‘em with just a 
drink or two, and that was about the most you could expect from any 
white lightning. It also made Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke a comparatively
 rich man.<br><br>Now like any other important and influential man, 
Uncle Curtis Stampp had friends. Rich friends. Important friends. 
Crooked friends. Some of these friends controlled the Alabama Democratic
 Party, which at the time was the only real party in Alabama, except in 
Winston County on account of the Civil War, but that’s another story and
 besides the Stampps had Winston sewed up anyway. Some of those friends 
also controlled the gambling and bawdy houses that flourished outside 
army posts all over the state, heck, all over the SOUTH. One of these 
towns was Phenix City, just across the river from Fort Benning, Georgia.
 Later on, after the war, some of Curtis Stampp’s friends had the 
Attorney General-elect of the state of Alabama assassinated because it 
looked like he was serious about cleaning up Phenix City. They didn’t 
really have a name for their group back during the war, but Curtis 
Stampps and his friends later on came to be called the “Dixie Mafia.” 
Some of their criminal descendants still call many of the shots in 
Alabama to this day.<br><br>After Pearl Harbor, Sergeant Luke realized 
that he was in on the ground floor of a big opportunity. The Army, his 
Army, was fixing to be a LOT bigger. More soldiers meant more vice and 
more money in his pocket. But there was a catch. While Matthew Mark Luke
 was patriotic enough to wish the Japs and the Krauts were all blown to 
hell, he wasn’t about to risk his own hide to do it. So a considerable 
amount of his time was taken up with using his influence (and that of 
his uncle) to make sure he never left the continental United States. By 
February, 1945, he had been transferred, and transferred again, each 
time promoted to greater responsibility, always in supply. His latest 
assignment had been of his own choosing, and promised to outlast the 
war. It was convenient in that it was located in his Uncle’s “Area of 
Operations” as they say in the Army. He may have been in the Army, but 
Matthew Mark Luke was doubly home.<br><br>Being the senior supply NCO at
 Aliceville offered many opportunities for an unscrupulous entrepreneur.
 The prisoners all had nothing but time to burn, and the Germans 
especially were skilled with their hands. They could take a tin can and 
make a beautiful ashtray out of it. There were woodcarvers galore, and 
their work (intricately carved gnomes and walking canes were the most 
popular) brought good money from civilians outside the wire. In return 
for the POWs’ art works, First Sergeant Luke traded them cigarettes, 
candy, liquor and on, occasion, women. By February, 1945, he was rolling
 in dough.<br><br>But like most self-made rich men, Matt Luke never had 
enough money and he was always looking for new opportunities. And, like 
most successful thieves, he had grown a bit careless. But the boxcar 
presented a golden opportunity, if he could just figure out how to pull 
it off. It had dropped into his lap like a ripe peach, and he wasn’t 
going to let it get away if he could help it.<br><br>First, he had to 
get a look at the goods. On the pretense of making sure that “nothing 
was missing.” First Sergeant Luke took a stroll over to the railroad 
depot and unlocked the door. Luke slid open the boxcar’s door and 
climbed up to the top of the stacked freight. Yup, there were grenades 
all, right, and lots of cases marked “Ammunition, Ball, .45 Caliber.” 
Crawling over top of the crates, working his way along the space between
 the roof of the car and the freight, First Sergeant Luke played his 
flashlight on the stenciling. “Gee-zus H. Chraaast,” Luke whispered his 
daddy’s Lord’s name in vain. There were cases of .45 caliber grease guns
 here to go with the ammo. He’d seen enough. Uncle Curtis would know 
where to move this merchandise.<br><br>Turning himself around in the 
cramped space, Matthew Mark Luke banged his head on one of the smaller 
crates on top. He cursed, then shined his GI flashlight on the markings.
 “Ping pong balls?!?” Hey, he could use those! Luke made his way back to
 the door opening and shoved the case of ping pong balls over the edge 
and out the door. The crate tumbled, bouncing twice, and landed about 
ten feet away from the tracks, upside down. Scampering down the stacked 
freight, the Master Sergeant jumped out of the car, slid the door back 
shut and replaced the padlock. Slinging the small crate over his 
shoulder, First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke headed back to town, 
immensely pleased with himself.<br><br>Seventy five yards away, hidden 
in the shade of the rail yard office roof, two men watched Luke carry 
away the case, although at that distance it was impossible to tell what 
the contents of the box were.<br><br>“You were right to call me, Mr. Peevey,” said the taller of the two,<br><br>“Yes, sir,” replied Peevey, “I knowed that sumbitch was up ter no good.”<br><br>“Don’t
 mention a word of this to anyone. Go home and make some notes about 
what just happened in case you’re asked to testify about it later. Be 
sure to note the day and time.”<br><br>“Yes, sir,” said Peevey. “I sure will, Captain.”<br><br>First
 Sergeant Luke turned right after he left the rail yard, easing on down 
the alley behind Aliceville’s main street, trying to be as inconspicuous
 as possible with his burden. Finally he came to the back door of the 
“rooming house” that everyone in town over the age of 10 knew was a 
discreet bordello and that almost no one knew was owned by one First 
Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke.<br><br>Dumping the ping pong balls on the 
floor just inside the door, Matt Luke entered the “boarding house” 
kitchen and made his way to the front room where the telephone was. 
There was no one about at this time of the morning. The “boarders” were 
all still sleeping upstairs, resting from their nightly exertions.<br><br>Twenty-five
 minutes and three phone calls later, First Sergeant Luke left the 
“boarding house” by the same door he had entered and made his way back 
to the camp. With Uncle Curtis’ assistance, he was about to steal a 
boxcar of United States government property. All he had to do now was to
 arrange with the proper office at the camp to generate the documents 
and make the official phone calls necessary to send the boxcar on its 
way. And since that office was run by one First Sergeant Matthew Mark 
Luke, he didn’t think that would be a problem. Smiling like the cat that
 ate the canary, the preacher’s son began to hum “In the Mood.”<br>. . .<br><br>Exactly
 one week later, First Sergeant Luke’s empire came crashing down upon 
his head. The crate that broke the camel’s back was filled with ping 
pong balls.<br><br>Captain Harrison Fordyce, Provost of the Aliceville 
Camp, appeared suddenly one morning in the supply office, flanked by no 
less than four MPs. Fordyce had been investigating Luke’s 
extracurricular activities for six months and prior to entering the 
office it had already been a busy morning. MPs under Fordyce’s command 
had already raided Luke’s whorehouse as well as a separate gambling 
establishment. Local police had not been contacted about the impending 
raids because Fordyce knew that most of them were on Luke’s payroll. 
Indeed, one of Aliceville’s finest had been found snoring next to the 
bawdyhouse madam. A state police captain was brought in from Montgomery 
to give the raids in town legal cover, but the operation was entirely 
Fordyce’s.<br><br>Luke had known from the week of Fordyce’s arrival at 
Aliceville Camp that he might become a problem. His sources told him 
that Fordyce was a bit of religious prig, and that the Captain neither 
smoked nor drank, did not apparently chase women and had no sense of 
humor whatsoever. Luke had approached the Captain from a number of 
angles offering various temptations but Fordyce had always ignored the 
hints or turned him down flat. In fact, Fordyce had been sent to 
Aliceville by the Army’s Criminal Investigative Division specifically to
 investigate complaints against First Sergeant Luke. This day 
represented merely another victory in the Captain’s lifelong crusade to 
rid the Army of vermin like the Winston County preacher’s son.<br><br>But
 the threat of Fordyce was never enough to cause First Sergeant Luke to 
alter his operations. He was making too much money, having too much fun,
 and had grown both cocky and sloppy. Stealing the ping pong balls had 
been the ultimate stupidity. He had wanted them for a third enterprise 
he planned for Aliceville, a “recreation center” for soldiers with 
perfectly legal billiard and ping pong tables on the first floor and 
highly illegal (and profitable) slot machines on the second. He 
certainly could have purchased a million ping pong balls with just one 
day’s proceeds of his gambling and prostitution enterprises. But they 
were there, and he felt untouchable, and so he stole them because he 
could. Now that crate sat in Captain Fordyce’s office, evidence of 
Luke’s theft of government property. It was turning out to be a bad 
morning for First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke. He was unceremoniously 
slapped in the camp brig, and the official grilling of his subordinates 
in the supply office began.<br><br>By the next day, Captain Fordyce was 
ready to question the First Sergeant about his nefarious activities. He 
had left Luke stewing in the brig all the previous day to improve the 
disgraced NCO’s willingness to cooperate. Fordyce had found this 
technique brought results in previous investigations. And he had many 
questions for Luke.<br><br>For example, this business of the ping pong 
balls was complicated by the fact that all documentation about the rail 
car-- its arrival at the camp, Sergeant Wilkie’s report, even the 
incorrect bill of lading-- was missing from the files. The crate still 
bore US Army markings it was true, but unless the ping pong balls could 
be proven to have been government property by some documentary trail, 
the theft charge was in trouble. Fordyce was just about to have Luke 
brought over for interrogation when two pieces of news reached him 
almost simultaneously.<br><br>First, the boxcar was missing from the 
Aliceville rail yard, and Station Master Peevey had no idea where it had
 gone. Second, First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke would not be available 
for interrogation that morning as his body had been found swinging from a
 bed-sheet in the brig.<br><br>Captain Fordyce could not have known that
 the First Sergeant was a claustrophobe. Ever since his daddy had locked
 him in a closet for punishment when he was a boy, the preacher’s son 
had a positive horror of enclosed spaces. After reading his report, the 
Captain’s superiors did not fault him for the outcome of the 
investigation. The court martial of the First Sergeant, even given 
wartime security rules, would have been messy and embarrassing to the 
Army as well as the town of Aliceville. Far better that Luke had solved 
their problem in the way he had chosen.<br><br>With Luke’s death, the 
problem just vanished. His little empire disappeared instantly and 
without a trace. No charges were filed. The prostitutes, gamblers and 
lesser bootleggers left town, and the clientele they had serviced now 
had to go further afield for diversion.<br><br>The mortal remains of 
First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke were transported by rail to the Natural
 Bridge station on the Southern Railway in Winston County, where the 
coffin was collected by his family. Two days later, his daddy gave a 
eulogy for the prodigal son. And if there was regret and remorse for the
 way he had lived his life, the grief and the tears at his graveside 
were no less real. In time, the U.S. Army provided an official headstone
 for the career soldier.<br><br>Less than ten miles away as the crow 
flies, another monument to the life and times of the wayward preacher’s 
son sat on a deserted siding of an equally deserted old coal mine. His 
last and biggest scam had been successful.<br><br>Not that it would do Matthew Mark Luke any good where he had gone.<br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">(Next: Poor White Boys - The Boxcar and the Duty.)</span></p>

							<p>Only thing that bothers me is simple.  Almost everything 
posted condemns private enterprise types who see a market/demand for 
what others condemn, but then get upset when their own enterprises get 
shut down by government.  Isn't this, largely hypocrisy, or was I taught
 the wrong definition as a child?  The man sent to investigate the 
preacher's son is a pure automaton not worthy of the title "man" yet 
he's written of as "impervious to temptation."  How does this make him 
look any different than the Nazi idiots from past chapters... all duty 
to their masters and no separate thoughts of their own?  Not doing much 
to advance the "cause of freedom" here other than to praise men whose 
only idea of freedom was strict obedience to doctrines they were 
subjected to since youth but had no hand in crafting, but other men did.<br><br>The
 greatest irony of all this is that the men who kill for the Federal 
Government in one instance are seen as evil scum, but if they wear a 
different uniform they're "heroes" even though they're still doing 
nothing more than carrying out the will of lying, bullying, unproductive
 parasitical scumbags who will never leave their offices or do any 
actual bleeding or killing, or even any productive work...<br><br>That 
being said, interesting writing, pushes all the proper patriot buttons 
but there are several mistaken premises and I have to wonder who would 
sit on the throne at the end of this revolution (for I doubt they'd have
 enough sense to just abolish coercive government and retain just the 
Golden Rule.)<br><br>I also doubt they'd appeal to reason, especially 
since they proclaim that the founders were Christian.  Deistic Masons 
perhaps, but in no way Christians.  That oversight is a big "no no" for 
someone using historic premises to write.</p>
