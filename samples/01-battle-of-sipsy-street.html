Disciple, Act III, George Bernard Shaw</strong></em></blockquote><br><br>Phil
 Gordon felt old, sick, tired and cranky. Cancer did that to you, but he
 didn't have to like it. Still, Phil had one more thing to do before 
crossing the bar and he prayed to the God of Abraham that he would have 
the time and the strength to do it. He shifted in his recliner, taking 
in the photographs on the side wall, a life in brief, partially 
illuminated by the soft glow of the porch light angling in through the 
windowpane above the front door. <br><br><br>Sitting in the dark, with 
the pictures shadowed in whole or in part, Phil couldn't see the 
details. He didn't need to. He knew them by heart.<br><br><br>It was all
 there -- his grandparents and great grandparents, stiff and formal in 
the manner of folks born in the 19th Century, his mamma and daddy in 
their youth. There he was with his parents at the ceremony when he 
graduated from Basic, and again, standing in the A Shau Valley with his 
squad, all of them so young and full of bravado. There was his wedding 
photo with Claire, and the honeymoon picture at Natural Bridge, still 
another of that sun-dappled afternoon with her at Smith Lake. Then there
 were those of the kids, still young, ranked by age. There was the time 
when his oldest son Bobby had competed with him at Camp Perry, and 
Bobby's graduation from West Point. A pink frame held Sissy in her 
scrubs during medical school, and from a steel-gray one Johnny smiled 
out front of his technology company in Huntsville, with Sally at his 
side and little Phil, Matthew and Gabriel at their feet. Then there was 
his retirement party at U.S. Pipe, more recent pictures of the 
grandkids, and the last reunion of his Army unit. It was all there, 
where he'd come from, where he'd been and where he was going. The dusty 
frames covered the wall above the sofa, in a room that had seen so much 
loving, laughter and then, sadness.<br><br><br>Phil took all of them in,
 those he could see and those he couldn't, closed his eyes and sighed. 
Well, it was a life. God had been very, very good to him. Still, he 
resented this last business of cancer breaking him down brick by brick. 
He knew he could bear it, it wasn't that. The pain, the gradual loss of 
functions, the bone-deep weariness, all were within his ability to 
stand. <br><br>It had hurt worse when he'd been hit in Vietnam. He'd 
been more helpless back during his recovery at Walter Reed. And he'd 
been weary beyond belief humping an M-60 machine-gun up and down the 
Central Highlands. Cancer came close to leaving him that tired but he 
didn't think it would be worse given the time he had left. Besides, ever
 since he'd lost Claire to a drunk driver from Mexico City, he'd been 
ready to lay down his burdens and go home to join her. He wasn't Job, 
but he could take it. But he was afraid, he admitted, that he wouldn't 
have enough left in him to do what now had to be done. It was a duty and
 he was stuck with it. <br><br><br>"Sometimes you're just stuck with the
 duty." His daddy had told him that when he was six and he had asked why
 he, Phillip Sheats Gordon, the youngest of seven sons, had to go out 
and fetch the firewood on a cold morning in Winston County when his lazy
 brothers were still snug in bed.<br><br><br>Sometimes you're just stuck
 with the duty. The Master Sergeant had told him that, too, just before 
he died on that no-name ridge near the Cambodian border. How long had it
 been, now? His mind dulled by the pain pill, Phil couldn't do the math.
 Long time, for sure. Hard to believe. The battalion had been strung 
out, looking for NVA supply caches when the Nathaniel Victors hit back 
hard. Under a barrage of mortars, recoilless rifles and RPGs, they 
overran the leading company. The air-cover was a little bit uncovered at
 that particular moment, and somebody had to slow down the remorseless 
sons of Uncle Ho until the battalion got its excrement together.<br><br><br>So,
 the battalion top-kick, one Master Sergeant Walter McCoy, took over 
Phil's platoon from the shaky lieutenant who had only been in country 
two weeks and who still didn't know crap from breakfast. With McCoy's 
leadership they'd stopped the bastards cold. Of course, it cost them 
most of the platoon, the still-bewildered lieutenant and Master Sergeant
 McCoy.<br><br><br>While they were digging in before the fight, McCoy 
had walked the line making sure the holes were sited properly and the 
M60s had clear fields of fire. As he walked by, Phil complained to 
nobody in particular, "Why us?" McCoy, a veteran of three wars and wise 
in the ways of killing, stopped, looked down at him and replied kindly, 
"Son, sometimes you're just stuck with the duty."<br><br><br>Phil was 
thunderstruck that he should hear his own daddy's words repeated back to
 him there, then, at that place so far from home when all their lives 
seemed forfeit. It seemed to him an omen, a talisman. It was reassurance
 that somehow, some way, he would make it out alive. He did. A buck 
sergeant, Phil was the senior surviving NCO when the NVA finally 
withdrew, leaving the ridge and the valley below strewn with their dead.
 When he saw McCoy's body after the fight, Phil sat down beside it and 
wept. He had never been in a position to be close to the top-kick, but 
now it seemed as if his own father had been killed.<br><br><br>"Son, 
sometimes you're just stuck with the duty." Phil could see McCoy's 
leathered face even now, softness at the edges of its perpetual, 
hard-set scowl. He could see the wisdom, the love, in his eyes. Phil 
shook his head, shuddering like a dog throwing off the rain. Enough of 
memory lane. He was stuck with the duty and he would fight. And he had 
no doubt he would die and that would be a good thing.<br><br><br>He 
looked around the battlefield that had been his home, and carefully 
raised himself out of the recliner. It wouldn't do to fall and break a 
hip now. Company was coming, and he had to be ready to greet them. He 
hoped it would be today. He had been scared of the attacking Nathaniel 
Victors, the whistles and the bugles, the explosions and the screams. 
With his whole life ahead of him then, he wanted to live. But now, at 
the end of his life, he wasn't afraid of the thugs who had targeted him.
 He was only afraid that they wouldn't come.<br><br><br>He had known 
that that they would get around to him sooner or later. He'd run his 
mouth too much. He was too political. He'd made his disdain for the 
thugs and their gang plain enough and now they were going to settle 
accounts. Frank Grant had met him at the pharmacy last month. The thugs 
had been asking about him, Frank said. What guns did he own? Did he have
 any machine-guns? They knew that Phil had held a blaster's license 
since when he worked in construction after the war. Did he have any 
explosives? Frank had been Phil's good friend for forty years. Yet when 
he assured Phil that he had told the thugs nothing, even after they'd 
turned his shop upside down, Phil wasn't sure. The fear on Frank's face 
was evident. The fact that he had hung around the drugstore to 
"accidentally" run into him, rather than calling him or coming over, 
spoke volumes.<br><br><br>Not that Phil blamed him. The thugs WERE 
scary, made more so because they operated under color of law. They 
controlled the justice system. The local cops, the state police, all 
deferred to the thugs, scared that they too would come under scrutiny 
and attack. There was no reason to expect a fair trial these days. 
Juries convicted innocent men and women based on the word of paid 
informers or friends of the thugs and suborned prosecutors who refused 
to turn over exculpatory material to the defense, denying that it had 
ever existed. The rule of law no longer applied. Now it was the rule of 
man, which is to say, the law of the jungle. Phil smiled at the thought.
 He had lived by the law of the jungle once and survived. He doubted 
that any of these young punk thugs had. Be careful what you wish for, 
you may get it. Phil chuckled. Oh, yes indeed.<br><br>It was still dark 
outside, early morning. That was no protection from the thugs, of 
course. They liked to do their evil work at night. They thought they 
owned it. Phil smiled. His sleep patterns had long ago been disrupted by
 the pangs of the cancer that ate at his vitals, so he often did his 
sleeping in the daylight anyway.<br><br><br>Phil took three steps over 
to the sideboard, maneuvering around the coffee table with the surety of
 a blind man on his own ground. Yet he wasn't blind, not even by the 
darkness. Above the sideboard hung a framed quotation from John Locke. 
It was one of his favorites. He could read it with the help of the 
PVS-14 night vision monocular he wore over his right eye.<br><br><br><em><strong>“Whenever
 the legislators endeavor to take away and destroy the property of the 
people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put 
themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon 
absolved from any further obedience.” ~ John Locke</strong></em><br><br>"Now would be a good time," Phil whispered in prayer. <br><br>God heard him.<br><br><br>The
 PSR1-A seismic intrusion detectors planted in the front yard that he 
first learned how to use in Vietnam began to crackle loudly through the 
speaker in the hall. Out back, his black lab Barney began to bark, then 
stopped with a yelp. The bastards, Phil thought, they always had been 
big dog killers. Phil instantly pivoted to look with his left eye at the
 closed circuit TVs he had arranged in a bank in the open closet in the 
hall. There was another set in the kitchen, a third in his bedroom 
upstairs, and a fourth in the basement. <br><br><br>Armed and armored 
black-clad men tiptoed up his front porch. Another bunch stood ready by 
the back porch. Phil smiled, for two reasons. First, he wasn't going to 
have to wait to do his duty. And second, the thugs were set up in 
predictable attack formation (they called it a stack) just like the 
manual told them to. <br><br><br>He was sure they knew where he was in 
the house from his thermal signature. What they didn't see was the 
concrete block and sandbag fighting position he had built in the hall 
that covered both the front and back doors. As Phil darted into the 
miniature pillbox and kneeled, the porch lights went out as the power 
was cut. The TVs and cameras still operated on their batteries. Phil 
grasped the semi-auto M1918A3 Browning Automatic Rifle in the firing 
slit with his right hand and found the first button on the electrical 
control box with the index finger of his left hand. <br><br><br>Wait, he
 thought, wait . . . The front door burst open. He pushed the button, 
brought his left hand up to the rifle's handguard and began to fire. The
 BAR was loaded with 21 armor-piercing rounds, one up the spout and 
twenty in the magazine. He could have used an M-1 Garand (he had twelve 
in his collection before he parceled them out to his kids as birthday 
and Christmas presents), but the BAR had a greater magazine capacity and
 he knew he had to get this bunch in one sweep. The thugs were all 
wearing military body armor. It didn't help them much. By the time Phil 
had emptied the magazine, the entire first stack of the raid party, save
 one, was dead or dying. Some of the tungsten steel AP handloads had 
penetrated two thugs at once. Night vision devices splintered, kevlar 
helmets split, the trauma plates of their body armor were fractured and 
holed and their illusions of invincibility were swept away along with 
their sorry lives.<br><br>Save for the moans of the dying and the yelps 
of the wounded punk crab-scuttling away from the porch, it was silent 
when Phil reloaded, stood and ran to the rear entry window that flanked 
the back door. The rear stack was splattered all over the flower garden 
that Claire had planted with such devotion and love, some of them 
screaming, moaning, moving. <br><br>The improvised Claymore mine in the 
flower pot that he had detonated when the front door flew open had 
shredded them from the left side, leaving the rear door intact. Body 
armor and helmets had saved some from instant death. Phil fixed that by 
shooting through the shattered window, hitting each of them carefully in
 the head. A growing hail of small arms fire now peppered the front and 
rear of the house, most of the rounds expending their energies on 
sandbag and concrete block reinforcements along the walls or on 
freestanding steel doors positioned to cover the windows. Fire even 
penetrated the roof, coming from a helicopter which materialized 
overhead, only to be stopped by a two-ply thickness of military surplus 
kevlar blankets that Phil had spread out in the attic. <br><br>It had 
taken Phil a whole month to improvise his fort, telling inquisitive 
neighbors that he was strengthening his gun room in the basement against
 potential thieves. Since the neighborhood had been going to hell of 
late, this was entirely believable.  The thugs thought I was above my 
defenses, Phil mused. <br><br>Oops.<br><br><br>OK, Phil thought with 
satisfaction, their Plan A just dissolved in front of their eyes. Let's 
see how quickly they start to work on Plan B. There was one piece of 
unfinished business, however. To the left of where the pictures now hung
 crazily in splintered frames (those that hung at all) the front windows
 had been shattered by the bullets of the support detachment, whose 
ineffective fire had dwindled off to shocked silence.<br><br>That 
thermal imaging device had to be out there. Phil crept up on his hands 
and knees, staying below or behind the sandbags and doors. Edging up, he
 peeked out with his AN/PVS-14. The surveillance van was just about 
where he had envisioned it would be -- just twenty yards down the street
 on this side. He could see the glow of the thermal imager on the face 
of the operator through the special glass of the back door. There was a 
small clot of thugs couched down to the side of the van but not under 
cover, looking on in unaccustomed horror at the bodies of their dead 
comrades scattered across Phil's porch and front steps, and at the 
crawling wounded man who hadn’t yet made it to the sidewalk in front of 
the house.  They did not try to help him.<br><br>Punks.<br><br>Phil 
ducked back, and a half-second later a burst of fire from across the 
street came through the space his head had occupied. Having determined 
his next targets, Phil crawled over to the steel door that most directly
 fronted the window-hole facing the van and changed magazines. From his 
World War II-vintage BAR belt, he selected three magazines, two from one
 pocket and one from another. All were loaded with an even mix of 
armor-piercing and armor-piercing tracer surplus rounds, originally 
produced to defeat the Germans and the Japanese. <br><br>Remember, he 
told himself, you're after body count as much as the van. When he opened
 the large, reinforced mail slot in the steel door, his thermal 
signature was in full view of the thermal operator. It didn't save him, 
for he died about halfway through the first magazine, just shortly after
 Phil cut the standing bunch of thugs in half. With the rest of that 
magazine and the following two, Phil sieved the van, its occupants and 
equipment, starting high and working low, finally exploding the gas tank
 with .30-06 rounds intended for Mitsubishis and Focke Wulfes. Phil 
noted with satisfaction that even though almost seventy years old, they 
still worked perfectly.<br><br><br>Almost as an afterthought, Phil 
finished off the crawling thug with the last of his third mag.  Rounds 
from the house across the street impacted the door, and one ricocheted 
off the mail slot door, causing Phil to flinch.  I’ll deal with you 
later, promised Phil.<br><br>As the riddled hulk of the van blazed and 
rocked with smaller secondary explosions, there were shouts of fear and 
panic at both ends of Phil's street. The thugs were pulling back to 
consider Plan B. And as much as he wanted to kill the shooter in Mrs. 
O’bannion’s house, now Phil had to buy time in back. <br><br><br>When he
 got to the rear of his house, he saw that some of the reserve thugs 
were cautiously working their way toward the back door, still thinking 
he was preoccupied in front. Had they been soldiers, they would have 
charged when they heard the BAR open up on the van. But they weren't 
soldiers, they were thugs. And they were surprised. No one had ever 
stood up to them like this. They were frightened. They were more worried
 about reaching retirement age than what was happening in front of their
 faces. So they were slow, they were tentative, and even with the raid 
commander shouting in their ears through their radio buds, they moved 
like molasses. <br><br><br>Phil had counted on that. What was it Sun Tsu
 had said? "Know your enemy and you will fight a hundred battles and 
have hundred victories." Something like that. Well, Phil had no 
illusions. He knew this was going to be a pyrrhic victory -- his own 
personal Alamo -- but so far his study of the enemy had paid off. <br><br>He
 proved it when he grabbed the Claymore clacker by the back window and 
blew up Claire's garden shed at the back of the property with a 
thunderous blast (it was just six sticks of dynamite packed in a barrel 
of ball bearings) that atomized the shed, turned the attackers inside 
out with the concussion and shrapnel and broke every window facing the 
alley (and some that weren't) for about a half a block around. <br><br><br>The
 first blast at the back of the house hadn't registered in Phil's brain,
 so concentrated had he been on the thugs coming in front door. But he 
heard this one all right -- heard it and felt it -- the concussion 
driving some of the air out of his chest and ball bearings and pieces of
 shed flying through every crack and crevice they could find or create, 
ricocheting off walls and steel doors.<br><br>One ball bearing tore a 
short groove sideways across his forearm and a long wood splinter stuck 
in his ass. Knocked back, scrambling, he broke it off, the point still 
in him. Crazily he thought, oh, well, it won't have time to fester. Ears
 ringing, gasping, struggling for breath and fighting disorientation, 
Phil sheltered behind sandbags along the back wall. After a minute, he 
pulled out a battle dressing from his pants pocket and put it on his 
bloody arm. <br><br><br>Well, they got me. But then he laughed, 
realizing that it was really just a self-inflicted, John Kerry kind of 
wound. But how many have I killed? More than a dozen anyway, maybe two 
dozen.<br>Not enough.  Not enough by half.<br><br>Gotta be more if I'm gonna to make the point so everybody gets it. <br><br>OK,
 time to cloud their vision. Phil low-crawled around the house on the 
first floor, pulling strings that he had run through eyelets screwed 
into the hardwood floorboards. The strings pulled loose from rolled-up 
space blankets installed at the top of every wall in the house. The 
space blankets, weighting with steel washers sewn at their bottom edges,
 unrolled to provide full-length protection against being seen by 
thermal imaging devices (he'd already installed them under the roof the 
length of the house). Finishing the first floor, and ignoring the 
ineffectual, random shots from across the street, he ascended the stairs
 and repeated the move in the equally hardened second floor rooms.<br><br><br>The
 thugs were hampered, Phil knew, by the narrow spaces between the houses
 in his neighborhood, which stood in an older part of town. Sooner or 
later, somebody in the gang's headquarters would suggest burning him out
 like the FBI did at Waco. But would they burn down a half block of 
innocent folks' homes just to get to him? Questions would be asked by 
authorities they did not control. News coverage would broadcast it to 
the nation. Were they ready for that?<br><br><br>Well, this wasn't going
 to be a drawn out siege and Phil wasn't going to hurt his neighbors if 
he could help it. Then he grinned. I've already blown the neighborhood 
to hell and gone and left dead bodies all over their nice lawns --maybe 
it's a little late to be worried about that, you think, Phil? <br><br>Still,
 this wasn't going to be a long drawn-out siege. Phil would see to that.
 He was, in military parlance, inside his enemy's decision-making cycle,
 and he intended to stay there. He could hear sirens nearby now, and see
 the reflected emergency lights of vehicles all over the place when he 
peeked around the barriers in front of the upper windows. The thugs 
would be gathering at their command vehicle by now, trying to figure out
 what went so terribly wrong and how they could retrieve their 
reputations with their fellow gang members by killing Phil Gordon.<br><br><br>OK,
 so get inside their heads. Everything went to crap, their first teams 
are dead, they've had to call in help, other gangs maybe. But they want 
to get this done. They will not pull back. The very top-ranking members 
of their gang will be huddled together at the command vehicle, trying to
 fight through their horror and panic and figure out what to do. I can 
help them decide.<br><br><br>Phil pulled the rope on the folding stairs 
that led to the attic. Confident that he couldn't be imaged through the 
space blankets, he made his way over to a fighting position he had built
 not far back from the eave. Weeks before, working at night, Phil had 
cut a section out of his roof, pulled it inside and mounted it on a 
hinged framework, thereby making a hatch in his roof. He did this front 
and back. The next day, went up on his roof and nailed shingles over the
 gaps created, telling his neighbors that he had leaks that needed 
fixing. Now he eased that hatch up part way, propped it up with a stick 
and took a look up and down his front street. Down at the brightly lit 
intersection, just where he expected it to be, was the command vehicle, 
surrounded by armed thugs. Other gang members came and went. While he 
watched, a second van pulled up, then a tractor trailer. Perfect.<br><br><br>OK,
 thought Phil, it's a math problem. First let's get a base number. He 
took the ITT range finder he had prepositioned there and lazed the 
center of intersection. The readout said 215 meters. Perfect. Just 
perfect. He brought out a plotting device he had made with a thin sheet 
of plywood and a magic marker. Setting it up to his right, he picked up a
 Chinese-clone M14S rifle with a loaded magazine. On the end of it, Phil
 had mounted an M76 grenade launching attachment. Twenty improvised 
fragmentation rifle grenades lay in a rack made from a large surplus 
metal 20mm ammo can built high into the position's sandbags. He had 
crafted them right after he heard he was on the gang's list.  If they 
were going to treat him as no better than a terrorist, he might as well 
act like one -- within limits.  Holding a rope that he had installed to 
the hatch's leading edge, Phil used the stick to push up the roof 
section until it began to swing down from the gravity. Using the rope he
 eased the hatch down until it was fully open resting on the roof.<br><br><br>Slowly
 rising, he peeked again from the perspective of where he would hold the
 rifle's muzzle. Estimating the angle from one side of the large target 
to the other, he took two white cloth tapes with a thumbtack on one end 
and a washer weight on the other and stuck the thumbtacks into the pine 
of the roof. These would be his aiming stakes. Dropping back into his 
sandbag cocoon, Phil rested the butt of the M14 on the attic flooring, 
and fitted a rifle grenade on the launcher. The chamber was loaded with a
 grenade blank, and the magazine held nineteen more. Twenty grenades. 
Twenty cartridges. Phil knew he would only be able to get away with this
 once, so there was no point in worrying about a second fire mission. He
 would be lucky to get all twenty off before he was killed.<br><br>Holding
 the rifle at the angle prescribed by the plywood plotting device, he 
flicked off the safety with his index finger. Aiming with the left hand 
tape as his guide, he took a breath, let it out, and pulled the trigger.
 With a "whoommpf" the rifle grenade was gone. Phil fell into the rhythm
 of killing: his right hand cycled the operating rod, and ejected the 
spent grenade cartridge. He let the slide go and the next cartridge was 
loaded. Shifting the right hand to the rifle's rear grip, he grabbed a 
grenade with his left and brought the projectile down onto the launcher,
 seating it firmly. His left hand went back to the forearm of the M14. 
He shifted the rifle, using the right tape as a guide for aim and the 
plywood for range. He had three rounds gone before the first one landed.
 Using the tapes and the plywood, moving the muzzle randomly down and 
up, side to side, Phil hammered the intersection. <br><br><br>Looking 
from across the street, the gang snipers could not at first figure out 
what was happening. Had he somehow gotten out of the house to directly 
engage the bosses? Then one spotted the faint blip of the last grains of
 burning powder that could be seen above the roof line. They began to 
fire, plastering the roof with small arms fire that became a general 
engagement. <br><br>Behind his sandbags and steel, Phil continued to 
launch the grenades. By the time he got to ten, all three vehicles were 
afire and the intersection was littered with bodies while sparks fell on
 them from a mortally wounded transformer high up a power pole. Eleven, 
twelve, thirteen. The roof was being eroded above him, around him, swept
 away by a leaden storm. Fourteen. Fifteen.<br><br>From down the street,
 a thug fired the heaviest weapon that the gang owned, an M203 grenade 
launcher. He had not been trained to use it, so the first round passed 
over the house and detonated far down on the next street, killing a cop 
directing traffic. Because the house was not hit, Phil didn't notice it.<br><br>Sixteen. Seventeen.<br><br>He noticed the second 40mm round though. In fact, it killed him. <br><br>But Phil Gordon didn't mind. <br><br>He'd done his duty. <br><br>He was home with Claire and he got to meet his Maker, his Savior. Absolving, he was absolved.<br><br><br>The
 gang never did get his guns though. When they tried to force the gun 
safe open in the light of day, it blew up, killing every agent within 
fifty yards of the place. In future, the gang resolved, they would 
never, ever, pick on somebody who had nothing to lose. In this 
resolution, they were to prove less than successful.<br><br><br>In Phil 
Gordon's pocket, they found a folded up piece of paper that, in part, 
said this: "But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing 
invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under 
absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off 
such Government, and provide new Guards for their future security." 
Across the bottom of the paper, Phil Gordon had scrawled a phrase in 
Greek: "Molon Labe."<br><br>Carl Elliott turned off the television.  
He'd seen more than enough.  His client, his life-long friend, Phil 
Gordon was dead and he had taken at least 52 agents of the federal 
government with him.  My God, what a slaughter.  If old Phil's intention
 had been to make a statement he'd certainly done that.  Of course the 
feds and their talking heads were already spinning the facts of their 
raid.  The ATF statements in particular described Phil in terms that 
were nothing less than bald-faced lies.  Carl looked at the envelope on 
his desk one more time.  It had been stuffed in the mail slot in his 
office door when he arrived on Monday.  It was Phil Gordon's 
valediction, he knew.  He did not want to open it.<br><br>At the same 
time, Kraut Mueller was opening a similar envelope in a safe house 
outside Oneonta, Alabama.  He cursed his rotten luck.  The federal 
operational security about the move against Phil Gordon had been just 
about perfect.  Kraut smiled grimly.  From the federal body count, it 
looked like that was about the only thing that had from their point of 
view.  Still, there was no chance to go to Phil's aid or to get Kraut's 
militia unit on the Fed's backs before the whole thing was over.  <br><br>Now,
 he held Phil's instructions to him in his hands and after reading them a
 second time he shook his head in grief and frustration.  In the note 
that accompanied the DVD, Phil commanded him to do nothing in 
retribution.  Nothing.  "This is on me and me alone," Phil had written. 
 "Exploit this politically.  If this works the way I think it will, I'll
 shock them down to their short and curlies.  I've made an affidavit of 
the facts that led up to this and given it along with supporting 
documents to my lawyer, Carl Elliott.  I've also made a statement on 
video and made a hundred copies.  You've got one, Elliott has one and 
the other 98 are in a small duffel bag in a storage locker in Jasper.  
The key and the address are in the small brown envelope.  Elliott also 
has a copy.  Whichever of you gets there first, take the DVDs and mail 
them from at least ten different post offices.  They are addressed to my
 family, my gunnie friends and the news media.  Don't go to guns just 
yet.  It's like you always said, 'No Fort Sumters.'  Watch and wait and 
let this develop.  Good Luck, Phil."<br><br>So, what do I do?  My guys 
are raging to strike back NOW.  Hell, I want to strike back now.  He was
 still thinking that when he popped the DVD in the player.<br><br>"My 
name is Phil Gordon, and if you are watching this I am dead at the hands
 of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  They will tell you 
that I am, that I was, a crazy gun felon, and that they began 
investigating me because I possessed illegal weapons and was a threat to
 the community.  None of this is true.  I have served my country, and 
lived all my life according to its laws, including those I didn't agree 
with because I felt they were unconstitutional.  Despite this, the ATF 
has apparently decided to target me for my opinions.  I have made no 
secret of my disdain for this agency, the unlawful way they conduct 
their business, the way they ruin the lives of citizens, framing and 
railroading them in corrupt federal courts.  I am especially disgusted 
by the way they reward illegal behavior on the part of their agents, 
including the perjury before Congress of the present regional director 
of the ATF who sits in Nashville, Tennessee.<br><br>I have written many 
letters to the editor and to my congressman and senators over the years 
on these topics, and I believe that this is why they have decided to 
shut me up.  I guess the First Amendment means as little to them as the 
Second.  But the reason you're watching this is that shortly after they 
opened their investigation of me, a friend told me that I had been 
targeted.  This gave me a choice.  I am old, I have terminal cancer and 
my beloved wife Claire passed away last year.  Although I would like to 
live longer to spend time with my wonderful sons and daughter and my 
precious grandchildren, I do not want their last memories of me to be 
from behind bars and armored glass at a federal prison.  And if you 
wonder now why I did what I did, it's because no one, not me and not 
you, can count on a fair trial in the federal courts today.  Numerous 
recent cases have proven that.  So if I can't get a fair trial and I 
don't want to go to federal prison, I might as well fight it out on my 
doorstep when they come to get me.<br><br>They will call me a terrorist 
and a threat to the community.  But THEY came to MY door.  I did not 
threaten them, I did not target them for their unlawful behavior, nor 
have I ever threatened any of neighbors or fellow citizens.  If I am 
dead it is because I merely defended myself.  Despite their federal 
badges, the ATF is a gang operating under the color of law.  If I am 
lucky and God grants my prayers, I will take a goodly number of these 
federal gangbangers with me when I go.  Some of them will die in 
explosions and from improvised munitions.  They will point to this as 
evidence of my law breaking.  But the fact of the matter is that I hold a
 blaster's license and may lawfully use explosives. Most of this 
material was purchased by me the day after I was informed I was an ATF 
target, and I have turned over the receipts and other supporting 
documentation to my attorney as proof of my statement. If I have used 
these explosives in unconventional ways to defend my life and my 
property, it was only because I knew that they would come for me in 
overwhelming force, totally unconcerned if they took me alive or not.  I
 merely returned the favor."<br><br>Phil shifted in his chair, and Kraut
 noticed for the first time that he had set up the camera in the 
basement of his Sipsey Street home.  You could just barely see the 
corner of his gun safe in the image's right background.<br><br>"There's 
something that happens to you when you realize that a portion of the 
federal government wants you dead, and part of it is that you cease to 
care about the laws that they use to oppress you.  I'm sure my neighbors
 are looking at their broken windows right now and blaming me.  I guess 
that's fair.  I am sorry for any damages they have suffered, but please 
understand that I didn't invite these thugs to our neighborhood."<br><br>Phil's face took on a harder look and he stared straight into the camera.   <br><br>"To
 the American people I would like to say this.  We do not have the 
government we deserve, but we do have the government we tolerate.  We 
have tolerated the tyranny of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives for far too long.  They only came to my house to kill me 
because YOU let them think they could get away with it.  And if you 
don't arouse yourselves from your long sleep with this wake-up call that
 I provide you with my death, they will one day be at your doors too.  
What will you do then?<br><br>To my gun-owning friends I would ask this:
 Don't let your emotions get the better of you.  Let my death and the 
deaths of the ATF agents I take with me be enough for now.  Let the 
administration explain why they felt it necessary to attack me.  Let the
 government explain that to the widows and orphans of the agents who are
 dead by my hand in legitimate self defense.  This did not have to 
happen.  Let them explain that to the country and the world.  And if I 
am wrong and they don't take this opportunity to reconsider their 
actions, there will always be another time.  But if those of you who 
know me, and who know that I am telling the truth, wish to honor my 
memory, honor my wishes too.  Don't take another life for mine.  
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.  Watch, and wait.  Perhaps 
the administration will come to its senses.  If not, as Locke says, you 
will be absolved by their further law-breaking of any duty to obey them.
  Then you can start shooting back.  But not now.  Not now."<br><br>Phil sighed.<br><br>"To
 my children, Bobby, Johnny and Sissy, I can only say that I love you 
and your children, my grandbabies, with all my heart.  I am sorry that I
 have had to do this, and I know that you will suffer from the notoriety
 and the press madness that defending myself will generate.  If the ATF 
gave me any other choice, I would have taken it.  But they didn't.  I 
hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me.  Your mother and I 
will be waiting for you in Heaven.  Goodbye for now."<br><br>Phil Gordon gave a slow, sad smile.  His eyes glistened with tears.<br><br>The screen went black.<br><br>Kraut
 Mueller was crying too.  OK, Phil, we'll wait.  You've given me the 
tool to stop the boys for now.  "But for how long?" he asked aloud.  
"For how long?"  The question echoed in the room.  And no one, not God 
nor Phil Gordon, answered.

Thank you, Patriot. And thank you for telling the truth daily.<br><br>As
 your writing shows, ours is a defensive position. I say this often to 
my friends. This is the way it must be for a change to be effected. Even
 at the loss of life.  <br><br>Aggressive attacks against The 
Constitution and our rights will continue. The Federal snowball that 
will eventually melt in a hell of it's own creation is not slowing down.<br><br>Thus we continue to prepare and train.<br><br>There is a way forward through defensive example. Should that example not be enough, other examples will follow.<br><br>There is much to do. I pray the God allows the time necessary.<br><br>Mike III

Mike,<br>This is one book I am going to read, if what you have written 
is 10% real, and 90% fiction, it is a clarion call to those of us who 
really cherish our God Given Rights to life! I too cried at the end, 
powerful stuff, my wife doesn't mind the tear or two, it shows her I am 
passinoate and care what happens to us all!

Great work.  Can't wait for the complete book.  I don't have an empty 
spot in my book shelves, so I'm buying a new one where Absolved will 
have a place of prominence.

My Dear Mike,<br><br>Namesake of my father, I have read many works of a 
similar nature, those on the side of government and those against.  
Those who choose government to exhalt always do so under the best of 
terms and examples, and then castigate and demonizing those who view 
government as the problem.  Americans who disagree with our government 
are not always demonized, it is true; however, this process of 
diminishing one's opponents with equivocations, outright lies, and 
subterfuge has increased in the last three decades to the point where a 
government established of, by, and for the people has apparently 
declared war on "we the people." <br><br>I understand, indeed, that what
 you've written is a fictional account; however, it is far from fantasy.
  The likelihood a scenario like you've presented would come to pass is 
extremely high.  The hero here, Phil Gordon, has nothing left to lose, 
his life is forfeit to cancer, his spouse deceased and his family 
dispersed as is normal.  Nothing left to lose except his dignity and his
 life, and he will not take another step backward.  There are more 
agencies that are thuggish in our government now than ever before, not 
just the ATF.  How about the IRS?  Are they not just as destructive of 
Americans and our prosperity as is the ATF destructive of our God given 
rights to life itself?<br><br>The First Law of Nature is "self 
preservation."  The Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights to U.S. 
Constitution is the guarantor of all the other rights espoused to in the
 bill.  Shall we permit our government to nullify the First Law of 
Nature and eliminate our rights to self defense?  I think not.  How will
 we resist further the government's attempts to disarm America?  Shall 
we wait for the thugs to come for us one at a time, imprison us at the 
least, kill us at the most, as with your Phil Gordon; or, shall we rise 
up as one and revolt against their tyranny?  What shall trigger this 
uprising?  Will it be a "Phil Gordon" like incident, a series of such 
incidents that finally pushes us over the edge?<br><br>Another 
consideration is our Armed Forces.  Will this administration hesitate to
 turn the might of our military against Americans?  I don't think so!  A
 poster on Red State.org, a retired combat LTC, insists the OathKeepers 
are looney tunes.  Whether he is right, or wrong, is of no consequence; 
however, he insists the U.S. Army will follow their orders, they will 
fire, and I concur.  Not enough of our servicemen and women even know 
what the Constitution says, let alone will stop to think about whether 
an order is lawful.  You know what the outcome will be, in that case.  
Our sons and daughters, nieces and nephews, and neighbors will fire when
 ordered. If it begins and the military is called, there will be 
casualties uncounted on both sides before it is over?<br><br>What will 
other nations do while Americans are in the throes of another civil war?
  Will they, seeing critical weakness, attack our nation's interests and
 holdings with impunity?  Who will stand for America during a bloody 
revolution within?  Our Armed Forces?  Will there be anyone watching 
outward from the porch while a bloody conflict rages inside?<br><br>There
 is no question that this Congress and this administration need 
replaced, en masse!  If we rebell against them outside the ballot box, 
and we are successful, they will be hung from lamp posts up and down 
Constitution Avenue, which is proper for the wrongs they've committed 
against the people; but, who will guarantee we can roll back all the 
damage they've done, restore America to the Constitutional Republic that
 was founded with the signing in 1787?  Will there be an America left 
when the blood stops running?

Oddly enough I reread it last night. I came here today and spotted it so
 I reread it again. I enjoy it every time. So I count it as a good use

Ahab, not all our servicemen and women will follow orders if they are to
 wage war against civilian America.  As odd as this sounds, I believe 
those most likely to refuse illegal orders are the "lifers".  Those who 
have been in for much time are more mature than recent recruits and most
 it seems have decided to learn what the constitution says and what 
their oath means.  This is in marked contrast to the young enlistees 
straight out of public education who have no grounding in the principles
 of the republic, and are thus more likely to be in awe of their 
superiors and prone to follow orders they do not even know are illegal.<br><br>But
 here again, many of these latter will be under the command of officers 
who do know what illegal orders are. So it ain't all bad.  Not to say 
there aren't a lot who will follow orders, but not nearly all.<br><br>From
 my own experience, my son just retired as a Major, he was a mustang, he
 was enlisted until the point where he would have had too much age in 
grade to become a second Lt. if he turned down that last request that he
 attend OCS.<br><br>Early on, we had this discussion and he said he 
would have to follow the orders of his superior officers, assuming they 
had more knowledge of the situation than he.<br><br>I told him it would 
be a shame if I had to shoot him if he attacked civilians on illegal 
orders. I also assured him that I loved him, but I would be on the other
 side and would grant no quarter.<br><br>Anyway, his attitude has 
changed completely. I asked why in light of our earlier opposing views. 
He said I convinced him that he needed to know what his oath meant and 
so he studied the constitution and the oath he took to it.  He is now 
one of the constitution's most ardent adherents. So, I must assume that 
maturation is likely to have been more the cause of his enlightenment 
than I was, and further, I believe we will find that to be the case many
 times over should the SHTF.

I was recently talking to a former Ranger and he strongly avowed that 
through training on how to treat civilians and the very strong beliefs, 
that the 70-80% of the true oath keepers would turn and fire on the 
non-believers if they dared to raise a rifle to armed civilians.<br> One
 thing bothers me though. I haven't read Chairman Mao's Little Red Book,
 but I've been told some of it from someone who had in 1965 at War 
College. The collectivists/Marxists/Commies will never give up. That was
 Mao's way, "keep the end goal in sight, never admit defeat". If you'll 
notice the gun-grabbers, for an example, they just keep coming. They may
 lose that battle or had "to make a strategic retreat" or comprise to 
very little, but they always keep coming back. The only way to win and 
stay won is to totally whip them into nothing, then destroy any sign of 
resurgence or complaciency will set in amongst us again and it will be 
to do all over again sometime in the future. Think of the Brady bunch 
and the ACLU, they always keep coming and are always on the attack.<br>AgPilot60

Straight Arrow, I fervently pray you are right.  I'd feel really badly 
about having to shoot American servicemen/women in self defense; but, 
make no mistake, I WILL shoot.  I'm a 30 year veteran of the U.S. Navy, 
have sworn the oath many times, consider the U.S. Constitution to be a 
holy document, and I will not take another step backward.  Take note, 
you statists: a lifetime of service to the nation has honed this 
fighting man into a weapon that yes, you really should fear.<br><br>Whoever
 said that attempts by Marxist and leftist liberals in our government 
and those behind them to subjugate the American people do so at their 
own peril knew whereof he spoke.  Always, I cautioned restraint, but no 
longer.  It's past the time for restraint.  It's now the time to start 
manufacturing home made claymores.  The gun grabbers never stop, nor 
will I and many, many, others like me.<br><br>Yup, I'm a "threeper," and
 what's even better is that we outnumber them by an order of magnitude. 
 We are veterans, trained in the use of tactics and weapons.  Even 
simple arithmetic should make them aware that 9,000,000 armed and angry 
citizens aren't to be trifled with lightly.  Those of us that have seen 
the carnage up close have a deep and abiding respect for human life, yet
 we went in harms way willingly.  Not a lot of libs in the bunch of men I
 served with.  They libs were well hidden, protected by us.<br><br>Do 
they think we will simply roll over and idly watch as they destroy this 
finest example of excellence in history?  When push comes to shove, they
 have no idea what's in store for them; because, if they did, they 
wouldn't be so cavalier in their disdain of "oathkeepers" and "three 
percenters."

This is great writing. Made me seek out chapter two, and when I found it, I realized why I'd stopped reading before. <br><br>In
 "Interposition" you muddy the ideological waters pretty significantly, 
by seemingly defining your side as fundamentalist christians and the 
other side as, essentially,  NAMBLA members.  You talk about liberty (in
 the privacy of your own home) but it really comes off like republican 
propaganda-- and I don't for a second believe that republicans support 
freedom.<br><br>Becoming a libertarian is a process, and I don't know 
when that chapter was written or where you were in the process at the 
time-- or now for that matter.<br><br>IF I were the one writing it, this
 chapter would probably be the hardest .  Action is much easier, while 
philosophy and ideology are a difficult to be clear on. <br><br>I see 
the ideological division in this country as being between americans and 
statists.  Americans believe in capitalism, individual liberty and 
choice, and while americans come in all shapes and sizes and stripes, 
what makes them american is recognizing that it is nobodies business 
what another american is doing.  Americans believe the initiation of 
force is immoral.   Thus they have a clear understanding of what is a 
crime (rape, murder, theft, etc.) and what is not (doing drugs having 
guns, being gay, reading pornography, etc.). <br><br>But the dominant 
political ideology in this country is not american.  It is tyrannical.  
And this goes for "both" parties.  They believe in central planning, and
 accept as a fundamental principle that all "citizens" are subjects of 
the state.  They believe the state has a role in every aspect of 
business and personal life-- from giving out marriage licenses (and 
denying them based on arbitrary criteria) to regulating medicine and 
fighting a war on people who choose politically incorrect drugs-- to 
total regulation of the economy.<br><br>Central planning for both our 
lives and the economy is not a coincidence-- its an ideology.  It is 
contrary to the principle upon which the American experiment was founded
 and thus is un-American. <br><br>Americans believe in freedom, and 
freedom is the power to make a million choices that aren't dictated by 
the state, any particular religion etc.  Freedom is the power to choose 
what's best for you based on your own values. <br><br>That's the 
ideological distinction I see. If you see it as well, then I 
respectfully suggest that "Interposition" would greatly benefit from 
some reworking. <br><br>Hopefully this doesn't offend, it's meant constructively. <br><br>Best wishes-<br><br>- a fan

Many soldiers have told me that for every Oathkeeper/3 percenter, there 
are 20 right behind them but for opsec and career motives, they remain 
silent. For everyone who fires on the people, there are those in their 
units who will rain hell down on them. Why, because the killers are 
killing somebody's family.  <br><br>It will be those 260,000 NATO troops
 and vehicles I believe that will beginj it under cover of stopping all 
the rioting--an inevitable result from the Government's policies 
designed to starve most os to death.<br><br>The top brass don't count. 
How many of you watched them fly over a firefight while getting their 
CIB and other tickets punched on the climb up the ladder. Do yourselves a
 favor; research how many of our generals/politicians/nsa directors have
 accepted Knighthood from the queen of England. You will be stunned. 
Then read the Oath they swore to royalty.

<h2 class="title">"Progress made under the shadow of the policeman's club is false progress."</h2>
<div class="widget-content">
I believe that liberty is the only genuinely valuable thing that men 
have invented, at least in the field of government, in a thousand years.
 I believe that it is better to be free than to be not free, even when 
the former is dangerous and the latter safe. I believe that the finest 
qualities of man can flourish only in free air – that progress made 
under the shadow of the policeman's club is false progress, and of no 
permanent value. I believe that any man who takes the liberty of another
 into his keeping is bound to become a tyrant, and that any man who 
yields up his liberty, in however slight the measure, is bound to become
 a slave. -- H.L. Mencken<br>

<div class="widget-content">
This is no small thing, to restore a republic after it has fallen into 
corruption. I have studied history for years and I cannot recall it ever
 happening. It may be that our task is impossible. Yet, if we do not try
 then how will we know it can't be done? And if we do not try, it most 
certainly won't be done. The Founders' Republic, and the larger war for 
western civilization, will be lost.<br><br>But I tell you this: We will 
not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will 
make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward
 will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.<br><br>And
 when we are gone, the scattered, free survivors hiding in the ruins of 
our once-great republic will sing of our deeds in forbidden songs, 
tending the flickering flame of individual liberty until it bursts forth
 again, as it must, generations later. We will live forever, like the 
Spartans at Thermopylae, in sacred memory.<br><br>-- Mike Vanderboegh, The Lessons of Mumbai:Death Cults, the "Socialism of Imbeciles" and Refusing to Submit, 1 December 2008<br>

<h2 class="title">"A common language of resistance . . ."</h2>
<div class="widget-content">
<strong><em>"Colonial rebellions throughout the modern world have been 
acts of shared political imagination.  Unless unhappy people develop the
 capacity to trust other unhappy people, protest remains a local affair 
easily silenced by traditional authority.  Usually, however, a moment 
arrives when large numbers of men and women realize for the first time 
that they enjoy the support of strangers, ordinary people much like 
themselves who happen to live in distant places and whom under normal 
circumstances they would never meet.  It is an intoxicating discovery.  A
 common language of resistance suddenly opens to those who are most 
vulnerable to painful retribution the possibility of creating a new 
community.  As the conviction of solidarity grows, parochial issues and 
aspirations merge imperceptibly with a compelling national agenda which 
only a short time before may have been the dream of only a few.  For 
many Americans colonists this moment occurred late in the spring of 
1774."  --  T.H. Breen, The Marketplace of Revolution: How Consumer 
Politics Shaped American Independence, Oxford University Press, 2004,
