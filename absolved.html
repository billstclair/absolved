<h4>Tyrants beware.  4th Generation Warfare: How the next civil war will be fought.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>"Direct military operations" are precisely
what the 4GW insurgent seeks to avoid.  His target is the mind and the 
will of the political leadership of his enemy -- to be specific, the few
inches between their ears which are filled with brains to be influenced
or, if not, popped like a grape with an unanswerable rifle shot from 
distance as an example to the others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excerpted from the non-fiction introduction to <i>Absolved: A
cautionary novel of the Three Percent and Fourth Generation Warfare</i> by Mike Vanderboegh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Whenever the legislators endeavor to take away and
destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under
arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who
are thereupon absolved from any <span style="color: red;">further</span>
obedience and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for all
men, against force and violence." -- <i>John Locke, 2nd Treatise on Government.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So reads the plaque on Phil Gordon's wall in his Sipsey Street home the moment before all
hell breaks loose. In <i>Absolved</i>, I try to explore the depths of Locke's belief
to discover where it might lead <span style="color: red;">the United States</span> in a civil war
set in the near future...</p>

<p>Another civil war in this
country is the last thing I want.</p>

<h4>"The Useful Dire Warning"</h4>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/RedDawnColTanner.jpg" width="236" height="320"/></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Darryl Bates:</b> What started it?<br/>
<b>Col. Andy Tanner:</b> I don't know. Two toughest kids on the block, I guess.
Sooner or later, they're gonna fight.<br/>
<b>Jed Eckert:</b> That simple, is it?<br/>
<b>Col. Andy Tanner:</b> Or maybe somebody just <span style="color: red;">forgot</span>
what it was like.</p>

<p>-- <i>Red Dawn, 1984.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why write about one? Perhaps, as David Brin, author of the magnificent book
The Postman (which bears no resemblance to the Costner cinematic flop), wrote
in a forward to a reprint of Pat Frank's classic Alas, Babylon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two books that emerged at roughly the same time as
Alas, Babylon were Eugene Burdick's Fail Safe and Peter George's Red Alert,
which later inspired Stanley Kubrick to make the magnificently humorous and
thoughtful Dr. Strangelove. As archetypes of the useful dire warning, each
dissected a specific possible failure mode, bringing it to the awareness of so
many that, ironically, their particular type of debacle became much less
likely. Indeed, the "self-preventing prophecy" may be the highest and
most useful species in all of the vast, imaginative genus of speculative
fiction. In much the same way that Orwell's 1984 girded millions against "Big
Brother," these tales may have helped to keep their own nightmares from
coming true. In other words, our most vivid nightmares may have been utterly
practical, helping to save our lives. -- <i>David Brin, Forward to the First
Harper Perennial Modern Classics Edition of Pat Frank's 'Alas, Babylon', 2005, p. X.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One wonders what might have
happened prior to September 11, 2001 if someone in authority had taken Tom
Clancy's "useful dire warnings" about a pilot deliberately flying a fuel-laden jet into the Capitol
building and killing the President and top leadership (Debt of Honor,
1994; Executive Orders, 1996) about
enemies of this country crashing airliners into public buildings in Washington,
D.C. Clancy himself reacted to the
11 September 1001 attacks by Al Qaeda:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Four planes? That many
people willing to die for the same cause at the same time? If any writer had
turned in a story like this, the publisher would have just handed it back and
said, 'No way. Not believable.'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can only hope that readers will take my own "useful dire warning"
more seriously. If one does ultimately break out, I will be as guilty of
fomenting it as Tom Clancy was guilty of 9/11 -- which is to say not at all. It is precisely what I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>But the vignettes that will hopefully coalesce into a narrative that flows from
the terrible opening to a logical conclusion (and I hope a good read in
between) are also presented with such detail for a purpose. If this book is to
operate as a "useful dire warning," then both real sides in my
imaginary civil war must be able to recognize the real threat to avoid the
conflict.</p>

<p>You may ask, which sides and what kind of conflict? </p>

<p>On one side, just as in 1775, will be the Three Percent, on the other, Locke's
"Arbitrary Power" -- and it will be a Fourth Generation War. All three
concepts require explanation.</p>

<h4>The "Arbitrary Power"</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>"If
I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright
ban (on so-called semi-automatic 'assault rifles'), picking up every one of
them... Mr. and Mrs. America, turn 'em all in, I would have done it." --
<i>Senator Dianne Feinstein, CBS-TV's 60 Minutes, 5 February 1995.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the Founders declared
independence, they prefaced that declaration with a detailed indictment of the
offenses of the King and his ministers. I
will not waste time or space here by comparing the present federal government's
excesses of arbitrary power with those of King George III. Go and read the Declaration and you will
marvel at how today's advocates of central power not only track quite closely
but make Lord North and Company look like kindergarten bullies in comparison.</p>

<p>The important thing to
understand about today's arbitrary power is that it, like its predecessor, is a
corruption of -- indeed, a subversion of -- a constitution that should have
restrained it. It was the failure of the
English Constitution which led to our first Revolution. It will be the failure of our own Constitution
which will lead to our next civil war. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A key reason the revolution
succeeded was its strictly limited scope. The Founders sought only liberty, not
equality or fraternity. They aimed to make a political revolution, not a social
or an economic one. Their Lockean social-contract political philosophy taught
them that the preservation of individual liberty was the goal of politics. Its
basis was the surrender of a portion of man's original, natural freedom to a
government that would protect the large remainder of it better than any
individual could do on his own -- the freedom to make your own fate and think
your own thoughts without fear of bodily harm, unjust imprisonment, or robbery.
The Founders' study of history taught them that the British constitution under
which they had lived -- "originally and essentially free," as Boston preacher Jonathan Mayhew described it -- was the ideal embodiment of such a contract. It was "the most perfect
combination of human powers in society," John Adams wrote in 1766, "for the
preservation of liberty and the production of happiness"--until George III began
to violate it. So Americans didn't take up arms to create a new world order
according to some abstract theory. They sought only to restore the political
liberty they had actually experienced for 150 years, and they constructed their
new government to preserve it...</p>

<p>So when, after 150 years of
letting Americans run their own affairs, the British government began to meddle
malignly with their liberty once 22-year-old George III became king in 1760,
following the death of his grandfather, George II, the colonists unsurprisingly
responded to the interference with outrage. After decreeing new colonial
customs duties and stricter enforcement in 1764, London imposed its first
direct levy on the colonies in 1765 in the Stamp Act, taxing every colonial
newspaper, journal, legal document, almanac, playing card, and other paper
product, in flagrant contravention of the "standing Maxim of English Liberty,"
as Livingston had quoted it more than a decade earlier, " 'that no Man shall be
taxed, but with his own Consent.' " As Washington wrote to a friend, "I think
the Parliament of Great Britain hath no more Right to put their hands into my
Pocket, without my consent, than I have to put my hands into your's, for
money." Property doesn't belong to the government, and the social contract
gives government no right to tell you what to do with your own.</p>

<p>The American Revolution, then,
was doubly limited in its aims: limited to making only a political change without
altering social or economic arrangements, and determined to set strict limits
to its new government, fearful that any governmental power beyond the barest
minimum necessary to protect liberty too easily could become a threat to
liberty itself...</p>

<p>-- <i>The Americanism of the American Revolution, Myron Magnet, City Journal, Autumn 2012.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, as we now know, the
Founders' system of limited government has been crushed by a century of
encroaching Federal power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All laws which are
repugnant to the Constitution, are null and void." -- <i>Chief Justice Marshall,
Marbury v. Madison</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The advocates of the "arbitrary power," of
course, say that they have the right to tell you what to do because they were
"democratically elected," ignoring the fact that the Founders themselves feared
pure democracy as much or more as they feared any other kind of tyranny. Without the limits of a constitutional
republic, "democracy" is three wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for
dinner. The fact that the "arbitrarians"
win elections claiming "mandates" and have rigged the court systems to prevent
their diktats from being overturned means nothing to people who, like the
Founders, believe that their rights to liberty and property are God-given and
inalienable. The most uncompromising of
these are the Three Percent.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/john-parker-n4-lexington-united-states.jpg" width="213" height="320"/></p>

<h4>The Three Percent -- the so-called "bitter clingers."</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The Revolutionary War in the
southern states has received little attention in comparison to the detailed
study given the campaigns in the North. This is unfortunate since much decisive
action took place there, but perhaps the nature of the struggle accounts for
the historians' neglect. The heroes of the southern fighting were not the
officers of the Continental army but rather the natural leaders of the people,
who had learned their skills in the continuing effort to seize the land of the
Indians.</p>

<p>By achieving better perspective of the past, something
may be accomplished in the present. For the hero of this book has fallen on
evil times. He is called various unflattering names today and is the butt of
comic-strip buffoonery and the 'villain' of serious novels. Because he remains
an individualist, he is a safe target.</p>

<p>There's nothing new in this attitude, of course. In
the Revolutionary War period, he was sneered at by the rich merchants of the
lowlands, he was held in contempt by the Continental army's high command, and
he was considered less than human by the British. Major Patrick Ferguson called
him a bandit, a barbarian, a mongrel. He had little respect for law and order.
He could be quite ruthless. He was also superstitious and at times naïve. Yet
Theodore Roosevelt could write of him:</p>

<p>'The fathers followed Boone or fought at King's
Mountain; the sons marched south with Jackson
to overcome the Creeks; the grandsons died at the Alamo.</p>

<p>And, it should be added, the great-grandsons provided
Lee and Johnson with the best fighting infantry the world had yet seen. Poorly
clothed, half-starved, they responded magnificently to magnificent leadership
and almost won America's
second civil war as their forefathers had won the first.</p>

<p>Moreover, in wars since, they have always been the
cutting edge. As F.N. Boney, the Georgia historian, puts it: 'There
is no shortage of rednecks in the neat, quiet American military cemeteries
which now dot the globe. However rejected in normal times, the redneck has
always been welcomed when the nation went to war.'</p>

<p>Peace is the dream today, and the redneck shares that
dream. For him it was often a "rich man's war and a poor man's fight." He never
started a war, but he was always ready when his home and personal liberty were
threatened. And because of the readiness to do his duty, this nation was
founded and kept alive...</p>

<p>Given proper leadership, the mountain man can still be
motivated. But in recent years such leadership has been largely lacking. The
potential remains untapped, but it is there. As my father used to say in Happy Valley,
"You may turn the damper up, you may turn the damper down, but the smoke goes up
the chimney just the same."</p>

<p> -- <i>Hank Messick, King's Mountain, 1976.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>History, for good or ill, is made by determined minorities.&nbsp; It is
estimated that during the American Revolution, the active forces in the field
against the King's tyranny never amounted to more than 3% of the colonists.
They were in turn actively supported by perhaps 10% of the population. Cheering
on these dedicated revolutionaries were perhaps another 20% who favored their
cause but did little or nothing to support it. Another one-third of the
population sided with the King (by the end of the war there were actually more
Americans fighting FOR the King than there were in the field against him) and
the final third took no side, blew with the wind and took what came.</p>

<p>The Three Percent still exists today, described by Barack Obama a few years ago
as "bitter clingers." Put simply, these are firearm owners who will not
disarm, will not compromise and will no longer back up at the passage of the
next gun control act. </p>

<p>Today's Three Percenters say quite explicitly that they will not obey any
further circumscription of their traditional liberties and will defend
themselves if attacked. </p>

<p>They intend, like John Locke and the Founders who studied him, to maintain
their God-given natural rights to liberty and property, and that means
most especially the right to keep and bear arms. Thus, they are committed to
the restoration of the Founders' Republic, and are willing to fight, die and,
if forced by any would-be oppressor, to kill in the defense of themselves and
the Constitution that they all took an oath to uphold against enemies foreign
and domestic.</p>

<p>It is the sons of Three
Percenters who make up the bulk of the tip-of-the-spear units in today's
military simply because they were raised by families to whom service to the
Republic is as automatic as breathing. Socio-economically, today's Three Percenters are not exclusively the
descendants of the Scotch-Irish that Hank Messick describes above, but they are
surely represented heavily. So, too, are
descendants of the Texans, of whom S.C. Gwynne wrote in <Empire of the Summer
Moon:</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were said to fear God so
much that there was no fear left over for anyone or anything else... -- <i>Page 20</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the Texans discovered the
tactical utility of the Colt's revolver gave them parity with the fearsome
Comanche lance on horseback, it spelled the end of that tribe's ceturies long
dominance of the plains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Texans were not the
Spanish or the Mexicans. They were
tougher, meaner, almost impossible to discourage, willing to take absurd risks
to secure themselves a plot of dirt, and tempermentally well-suited to the
remorseless destruction of native tribes. They did not rely on a cumbersome, heavily-mounted, overly
bureaucratized, state-sponsored soldiery; they tended to handle things
themselves, with volunteers who not only were not scared of Indians but
actually LIKED hunting them down. -- <i>Page 82</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Texans certainly ranked among
the Three Percenters of their day.</p>

<p>Three Percenters today do not claim that they represent 3% of the American
people, although they might. That theory has not yet been tested. They DO claim
that they represent at least 3% of American gun owners, which is still a
healthy number somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 million people. Remember,
history, for good or ill, is made by determined minorities. They are one
such minority. So too are the current domestic enemies of the Founders'
Republic who seek to disarm them. What remains, then, is the test of will
and skill to determine who shall shape the future of our nation.</p>

<p>That test of will and skill will be fought by warfare in the Fourth Generation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Cherish your enemies - they teach you the best lessons" -- <i>Ho Chi Minh.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/HoChiMinh.jpg" width="259" height="320"></a></p>

<h4>Fourth Generation Warfare</h4>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the term, here's one succinct definition from the
best single book on the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Fourth Generation Warfare) uses all available
networks -- political, economic, social, and military -- to convince the enemy's
political decision makers that their strategic goals are either unachievable or
too costly for the perceived benefit. It is an evolved form of insurgency.
Still rooted in the fundamental precept that superior political will, when
properly employed, can defeat greater economic and military power, 4GW makes
use of society's networks to carry on its fight. Unlike previous generations,
it does not attempt to win by defeating the enemy's military forces. Instead,
via the networks, it directly attacks the minds of enemy decision makers to
destroy the enemy's political will. Fourth-generation wars <i>are</i> lengthy
-- measured in decades rather than months or years... Strategically, 4GW
attempts to directly change the minds of enemy policy makers. This change
is not to be achieved through the traditional method of superiority on the
battlefield. The first- through third-generation of destroying the
enemy's armed forces and his capacity to regenerate them is not how 4GW enemies
will attack... Both the epic, decisive Napoleonic battle and the
wide-ranging, high-speed maneuver campaign is irrelevant to them. Their
victories are accomplished through the superior use of all available networks
to directly defeat the will of the enemy leadership, to convince them their war
aims are either unachievable or too costly. These networks will be
employed to carry specific messages to our policy makers and to those who can
influence the policy makers. -- <i>COL Thomas X. Hammes, USMC, The Sling and the Stone, p. 208</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what were the previous three generations?&nbsp; William S. Lind offers this
in his essay, "The Four Generations of Modern Warfare" at the Lew Rockwell blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The First Generation of modern war began with the
Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the
Thirty Years War. It also marked the state's assumption of a monopoly on war;
thereafter, war became something waged by states, for raison d'etat, with state
armies and navies doing the fighting. The First Generation ran from 1648 to
about the time of the American Civil War, and it was characterized, on the
whole, by a battlefield of order. The battlefield of order created a military
culture of order, which endures to this day.</p>

<p>And there's the rub. For around the middle of the 19th century, the
battlefield of order began to break down. Ever since, state militaries have had
to grapple with a growing contradiction between their internal culture of order
and the external reality of an increasingly disordered battlefield.</p>

<p>The Second and Third Generations represent two different approaches to
that problem. Second Generation war was developed by the French Army during and
after World War I, and is best summed up with the French saying, "The
artillery conquers, the infantry occupies." Also known as
firepower/attrition warfare, Second Generation war maintained the First
Generation culture of order. Decision-making was centralized and hierarchical;
orders were detailed and controlling, to permit synchronization of all arms;
time was not particularly important; and success was measured by comparative
body counts. Second Generation armed forces focus inward on methods, processes
and procedures, prize obedience over initiative (initiative and synchronization
are not compatible) and depend on imposed discipline. The American Army and Marine
Corps learned Second Generation war from the French during the First World War
and still practice it today, with exceptions based on individual commanders.</p>

<p>Third Generation war, also known as maneuver warfare, was developed by
the German Army in World War I; by 1918, Blitzkrieg was conceptually complete,
lacking only the tanks necessary for operational mobility. The Prussian/German
roots of Third Generation war go back earlier, to the Scharnhorst reforms that
followed Prussia's
defeat by Napoleon. One of those reforms changed what was required of a
Prussian officer; instead of being responsible for obeying orders, he became
responsible for getting the result the situation required regardless of orders
(in 19th century war games, it was common for junior Prussian officers to be
given problems that could only be solved by disobeying orders). This in turn
created a military culture that was focused outward, on the enemy, the
situation and the result the situation demanded instead of inward on rules,
orders and processes. In effect, Prussia had broken with the First
Generation culture of order.</p>

<p>The new Third Generation tactics developed by the Germans in World War I
were the first non-linear tactics. On the defense, the objective became sucking
the enemy in, then cutting him off, rather than holding a line. On the
offensive, the attack flowed like water through the enemy's defenses, always
seeking the weakest point to penetrate, then rolling him up from his own rear
forward. Operationally as well as tactically the goal was usually encirclement.
Speed replaced firepower as the most important tool, and dislocation, mental as
well as physical, was more important than attrition. Culturally, not only was
the German Army outward-focused, it prized initiative over obedience and it
depended on self-discipline rather than imposed discipline.</p>

<p>Much of the American military reform movement of the 1970s, 80s and early
90s was an attempt to move the American armed forces from the Second to the
Third Generation. While the Marine Corps formally adopted maneuver warfare as
doctrine in the 1990s, most of what the Marine Corps does remains Second
Generation. The other American services remain almost wholly Second Generation,
to the frustration of many junior officers.</p>

<p>Fourth Generation war is the greatest change since the Peace of Westphalia, because it marks the end of the state's
monopoly on war. Once again, as before 1648, many different entities, not
states, are fighting war. They use many different means, including
"terrorism" and immigration, not just formal armies. Differences
between cultures, not just states, become paramount, and other cultures will
not fight the way we fight. All over the world, state militaries are fighting
non-state opponents, and almost always, the state is losing. State militaries
were designed to fight other state militaries like themselves, and against
non-state enemies most of their equipment, tactics and training are useless or
counterproductive.</p>

Daniel Morgan</p>

<h4>"Sure won't his Majesty's Government train them for me?"</h4>

<p>Of course there have been Fourth Generation insurgencies for thousands of
years, as well as the use of 4GW tactics and strategies by state militaries
against other state militaries. <i>(See Sun Tzu's The Art of War.)</i> The
American Revolution began as an insurgency of largely non-state actors and used
militia guerrilla tactics throughout the war even after the development of the
Continental Line <i>(See Paul Revere's Ride and Washington's Crossing by
David Hackett Fischer.)</i></p>

<p>The most remarkable and effective field commander of the Revolutionary forces
was Daniel Morgan, whose ability to integrate militia and regulars at the
battle of Cowpens set up Cornwallis' ultimate defeat at Yorktown.
<i>(See A Devil of a Whipping by Lawrence F. Babits, also Daniel Morgan:
Revolutionary Rifleman by Don Higginbotham.)</i></p>

<p>A veteran of the French and Indian War, Morgan commanded one of Virginia's two rifle
companies sent to support the Siege of Boston in late June 1775.&nbsp; Morgan
had served as an officer in the Virginia Colonial Militia since the French and
Indian War. He recruited 96 men in 10 days and assembled them at Winchester on 14 July. He
then marched them 600 miles to Boston
in only 21 days, arriving on Aug. 6, 1775. Known as Morgan's Riflemen,
they soon discouraged British raids out of Boston with the accuracy of their long-range
fire, something the British could not match. He also initiated tactics
which first targeted the British formation's Indian guides, then their
officers, then their NCOs. The British found this to be "barbaric."</p>

<p>Morgan was an impressive field commander, big in size yet poorly educated, he
enjoyed drinking and gambling but the troops never forgot who was in
command. Morgan had served as a civilian teamster during the French and
Indian War. After returning from the advance on Fort Duquesne
by General Braddock's command, he was punished with 499 lashes (a usually fatal
sentence) for punching his superior officer. Morgan, not surprisingly, hated
the British army. He later served as a rifleman in the Provincial forces
assigned to protect the western border settlements from French-backed Indian
raids, and in 1774 he served in Dunmore's War, taking part in raids on Shawnee villages in the Ohio Country.</p>

<p>During the Saratoga campaign, Morgan's riflemen
played a key role at the preliminary battles of Freeman's Farm and later at Bemis Heights,
where at his order the British General Fraser was mortally wounded at his order
by rifleman Tim Murphy. This was the single most important rifle shot of
the war, since the loss of Fraser caused the British attack to collapse and the
subsequent surrender of the entire British force persuaded the French to <span style="color: red;">enter the</span> war.</p>

<p>After Cowpens, Morgan went home on sick leave, but he had certainly paid the
British back for those 499 lashes. There were many Revolutionary officers
and men who had acquired their military experience in the French and
Indian War. And like Morgan, many of them had also acquired an acute
understanding of what the British army could and could not do in the terrain of
North America.</p>

<p>This formation of young soldiers in the crucible of war is a constant found
throughout history. The primary lessons were moral ones, not
military. And morale is critical in 4GW.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/The_Sling_and_the_Stone.jpg" width="218" height="320"/></p>

<p>As Hammes describes in the beginning of The Sling and the Stone:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1987 to 1990, I got a small taste of the
practical aspects of insurgency. I spent those years training insurgents in
various locations of the world. This was the tail end of the Cold War and the United States
still had vested interests in the outcome of a number of insurgencies. The most
intriguing part of the tour was the opportunity to talk to these men. I was
particularly impressed with two aspects of the men I met. First was their utter
determination to continue the struggle despite the odds. They were not deterred
by fear of death. In each case, they were engaged in a struggle with a
government force that possessed many times their military power. In each case,
they knew the odds and were not deterred. They believed in their cause and were
sure that belief was powerful enough to defeat the government. The idea they
fought for was central to their resistance. In fact, they were counting on
political power generated by that idea to neutralize the overwhelming military
power of the government. As I worked with these men, I realized this fact
should be obvious to Americans. An idea kept our American revolution alive
during seven long years of war. (Emphasis supplied, MBV. It should also be
noted that for most of the key leaders of our Revolution, the struggle began a
decade earlier with the Stamp Act crisis.)</p>

<p>The second outstanding trait was the remarkable ingenuity they displayed
for overcoming problems. Whether the problems were tactical, logistical,
doctrinal, or political, they often attacked them from a direction that simply
would not occur to a Western-trained soldier. I found insurgents are not
impressed with conventional power. They respect it but seek ways around it --
and have consistently succeeded in finding those ways. They often used tactics
and techniques that were outside the training and experience of the government
forces. Despite years of war, they consistently surprised government forces
with their ingenuity and determination. Insurgents are living proof of why man
is at the top of the food chain. We are the most creative, treacherous, loyal,
aggressive, and determined life form to yet evolve. Any nation that assumes it
is inherently superior to another is setting itself up for disaster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would add to that last sentence that the same goes for political elites, only
more so. This is perfectly understood by 4GW fighters.</p>

<p>Michael Collins, perhaps the 20th Century's most accomplished virtuoso in 4GW,
fought in the disastrous 1916 Easter Rising, and afterward was being paraded
with other prisoners through the streets of Dublin on their way to prison.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/michael-collins.jpg" alt="Michael Collins" width='170' height='250'/><br/>
Michael Collins</p>

<p>As the column passed the ruins of Liberty Hall, a young woman caught up with
her cousin (Collins) and called out to him. "What will you do now?"
"Do?" asked Collins, "Do? Sure I'll get ready for the next round of
course. I've got some of the names taken down already... The best of
men." His cousin was flabbergasted. "But... What?... How are you
going to train them?" she called out. Collins replied, "Sure won't His
Majesty's Government train them for me?" <i>(See Michael Collins by Tim Pat
Coogan. Also, Collins' best field commander in West Cork, Tom Barry, was
a British Army veteran of the Iraq
theatre during World War One. See Barry's Guerilla Days in Ireland.)</i></p>

<p>This is something that the governments who seek to fight 4GW don't
understand. The 4GW warrior thinks in terms of decades, not months or
years. He or she will fight until victory or death. The long wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan,
then, can also be seen as universities for American armed citizens in 4GW
tactics and techniques.</p>

<p>So, who invented 4th Generation Warfare?</p>

<p>Says Hammes in The Sling and the Stone:</div>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<p>This new form of war did not arrive on the scene as a
fully developed instrument but has evolved over decades and continues to evolve
at widely scattered locations. We are not in the middle of a revolution
in military affairs but rather an evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different authors assign different origins to 4GW. Hammes traces it to
Mao Tse-Tung, yet we know that much of Mao's theory was based upon the ancient
Sun Tsu. Hammes then discusses the "Vietnamese modification" and the
"Sandanista refinement." In each of the latter cases the insurgents were
fighting for control of the mindset of the United States Congress through
popular opinion within our country. But of course this is precisely how the
Founders of our own country defeated the British -- the defeat at Yorktown
caused Lord North's government to collapse and the new government that replaced
it came in with a promise to end the North American war, which it promptly did.</p>

<p><i>(For more on the Vietnamese example, see Street Without Joy by Bernard B. Fall,
who suggests that the principal theorist of 4GW on the communist side was
neither Ho Chi Minh nor Vo Nguyen Giap but Truong-Chinh.)</i></p>

<p>The American example also inspired Michael Collins, who added his own
improvisation which proved decisive:</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Collins evolved a new concept of guerrilla warfare
that in time would be copied by guerrilla leaders all over the globe from Mao
to Shamir. The Collins philosophy was based not on the capture of enemy
bricks and mortar, but of its information. Traditionally Dublin Castle,
the seat of British administration in Ireland, had used a network of
spies and informers to infiltrate and then snuff out movements directed at
securing Irish independence. Collins perfected a system of spying on the
spies. Every important branch of the Castle system, whether it was
banking, policing, the railways, shipping, the postal service -- whatever --
was infiltrated by his agents. These were not highly trained, CIA-style
operatives, but ordinary men and women, little people whom nobody had ever
taken notice of before. Collins gave them a belief in themselves, a
courage they did not know they possessed, and they in return gave him a
complete picture of how their masters operated... For the first time in their
history the Irish had a team of assassins trained to eliminate informers...</p>

<p>Held back from making a full-scale use of their Army by the force of
world opinion -- largely Irish-American opinion -- the British tried to fight a
"police war" carried on by hastily-formed forces of ex-servicemen and officers
troubled by little discipline and less conscience. The Black and Tans and
the Auxiliaries wrote new chapters of horror in the bloodstained story of the
Anglo-Irish relationship. Reprisals for the activities Collins and his
colleagues included the burning of homes and creameries, random murder and the
widespread use of torture...</p>

<p>In addition to his campaign of warfare, he ran a national loan, which was
banned by the British so that either its advertisement or sale became
illegal. Yet the loan was fully subscribed, and every subscriber got a
receipt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>(Again, see Michael Collins by Tim Pat Coogan, as well as G2 In Defence
of Ireland: Irish Military Intelligence 1918-1945 by Maurice Walsh.)</i></p>

<p>As brilliant as he was, Collins would later claim that he drew much of his own
inspiration from the lessons learned by the Boer commando Christiaan Rudolph de
Wet.</p>

<p>British General Rupert Smith, in his very useful book The Utility of Force,
passes over the American Revolution with a few words and then identifies the
"war amongst the people" (his term for 4GW) as being invented by the Spanish
and Portuguese guerrillas in their "little war" against Napoleon's forces.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that 4GW has been evolving over at least the past couple of
centuries, not the decades Hammes suggests, and certainly in terms of timeline,
the American revolutionaries of 1775 can lay as good a claim as any to being
its inventors. This is an opinion that the current American Three Percent
have no problem adopting.</p>

<p><u><i>However, a 4GW civil war waged
by men and women who are loyal to the Founders' concepts would not fight an unrestrained
Al Qaeda campaign but one specifically targeted to spare civilians and to
target the war decision makers. The next
American civil war will either successfully break new ground in 4GW tactics and
techniques or it will descend into a welter of blood and massacre. Governments have a tendency to do that when
they're losing. The 4GW warriors who
claim to represent the Founders' Republic will have to require of themselves far more
discipline and intelligence  -- no Fort Sumters and no Oklahoma City bombings. </i></u></p>

<h4>The Utility of Force by a Regime to Impose its Will, or Lack Thereof.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>War amongst the people is both a graphic description
of modern warlike situations, and also a conceptual framework: it reflects the
hard fact that there is no secluded battlefield upon which armies engage, nor
are there necessarily armies, definitely not on all sides. To be clear:
this is not asymmetric warfare, a phrase I dislike invented to explain a
situation in which conventional states were threatened by unconventional powers
but in which conventional military power in some formulation would be capable
of both deterring the threat and responding to it. War amongst the people
is different: it is the reality in which the people in the streets and houses
and fields -- all the people, anywhere -- are the battlefield. Military
engagements can take place anywhere : in the presence of civilians, against
civilians, in defense of civilians. Civilians are the targets, objectives
to be won, as much as an opposing force... Labeling wars as asymmetric is to
me something of a euphemism to avoid acknowledging that my opponent is not
playing to my strengths and I am not winning. -- <i>General Rupert Smith,
The Utility of Force: The Art of War in the Modern World, pp. 5-6</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The advocates of the disarmament of the American populace such as the
aforementioned CSGV always begin by saying that no group of citizenry can
oppose the might of the federal government because of the vast array of
weaponry including aircraft, artillery and even nuclear weapons that the
federals could bring to bear if they are opposed trumps any number of armed
"insurrectionists" with rifles. This ludicrous argument is not only
contradicted by many examples throughout history but begs the moral question of
resistance to a predatory government itself. If a government is so
depraved as to use nuclear weapons against its own people on its own soil, it
will not long survive the condemnation of even the people who otherwise support
it. The same goes for artillery and air strikes, even so called
"surgical, decapitation operations." (More about that in a minute.)
Such weapons are, in 4GW, merely expensive but useless, appendages, especially
in an uncontrolled media environment.</p>

<p>The fact that CSGV and its collectivist familiars even suggest the nuclear
boogeyman as a real threat by the federal government merely marks them as moral
pariahs -- inciters of holocaust -- and tells you everything you need to know
about such people. THEY are apparently the ones who are willing to see
millions of their own citizens dead in pursuit of gun control and a government
monopoly on violence. They are bloodthirsty people indeed.</p>

<p>The utility -- practical or moral -- of using even precision-guided munitions
from artillery or aircraft in a civil war upon your own people, in your own
territory and athwart your own logistics tail is also militarily problematic,
especially in a media environment that includes the Internet, even more
especially in a country such as the U.S. which depends upon it for so much of
its own economic activity that it cannot be totally shut down.</p>

<p>First, such strikes are not entirely "precision-guided" as we have seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to "collateral
damage" (a sanitary military euphemism for dead civilians) and moral
discredit. Remember such a civil war would be "amongst the people" in
General Smith's term and for their loyalty. Thus any smart 4GW operator
is going to eliminate the possibility of his side creating "collateral
damage." Notice I said "eliminate the possibility." Only a fool or
a government agent would try to advance his or her cause by committing an Oklahoma City bombing
with a day-care full of innocent kids in it. Remember, too, that 4GW
warfare is designed to change the minds of the war making elite in their
opponent's capitol. OKC bombings merely strengthen their hand, not
discredit it. (Recall that after he was re-elected in 1996, Bill Clinton
told reporters on Air Force One while traveling back to DC from Arkansas that
"Oklahoma City broke the spell.")</p>

<p>Indeed, if you are looking for a weapon that is in fact "precision-guided" you
need look no further than a bolt-action rifle aimed at an identified target and
wielded by someone who knows what to do with it. This, in fact, defines
the Three Percenters, who, being limited to rifles, know them very well and
compete with each other to win competition matches somewhere in this country
every weekend. Can this be why Senator Dianne Feinstein -- a long-time
advocate of "turn 'em in, Mr. and Mrs. America" -- is so obsessed with
"sniper" rifles that can "puncture a limousine" or "take down an
aircraft"? <i>(See "A Short History of Long Range Shooting in the United States"
by Hap Rocketto in The Rifleman's Journal, September 2009.)</i></p>

<p>Second, such bad publicity might be endured if the civil war was quickly put to
an end by such tactics, but in 4GW this is not only uncertain, it is fantasy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The final critical characteristic of 4GW is that its
timelines, organizations, and objectives are different from those of earlier
generations. Of particular importance is understanding that the timelines
are much longer...</p>

<p>The United States
wants to fight short, well-defined wars. We went into Vietnam, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Afghanistan,
and Iraq
convinced we could "clean it up" quickly. In each conflict, our leaders
told the people we would be out in a year or so... For the United States,
a long war is five years... </p>

<p>Unfortunately, 4GW wars are long. The Chinese Communists fought for
twenty-eight years (1921-1949). The Vietnamese Communists fought for
thirty years (1945-1975). The <span style="color: red;">Sandinistas</span>
fought for eighteen years (1961-1979). The Palestinians have been
resisting Israeli occupation for twenty-nine years so far (1975-2004).
The Chechens have been fighting for more than ten years -- this time.
Al-Qaeda has been fighting for their vision of the world for twenty years,
since the founding of MAK in 1984. Numerous other insurgencies have
lasted decades. Accordingly, when getting involved in a 4GW fight, we
should be planning for a decades-long commitment. From an American point
of view, this may well be the single most important characteristic of
4GW.</p>

<p>Next, we need to understand that 4GW organizations are different.
Since Mao, 4GW organizations have focused on the movement's long-term political
viability rather than its short-term tactical effectiveness. They do see
themselves as military organizations but as webs that generate the political
power central to 4GW. Thus, these organizations are unified by
ideas. The leadership and the organizations are networked to provide for
survivability and continuity when attacked. And the leadership recognizes
that their most important function is to sustain the idea and the organizations
-- not simply to win on the battlefield.</p>

<p>-- <i>COL Thomas X. Hammes, USMC, The Sling and the Stone, p. 221-2.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much is made in Third-Generation Warfare of "getting inside the enemy's OODA
Loop" (for observe, orient, decide, and act) in order to disrupt their
operations. Hammes points out that 4GW warriors don't even
try.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, because of the long timelines, even the
objectives are different. Fourth-generation-warfare opponents do not seek
to service more targets faster to disrupt an enemy's OODA loop. They do
not seek to destroy an opponent's industrial base using the U.S. Air Force's concept of
targeting key segments of an opponent's society. Nor do they seek to
dislocate the enemy's armed forces so that their decision cycle fails and the
enemy collapses. In fact, it is essential to 4GW strategists that the
opponent complete his strategic OODA loop -- with the resulting decision that
the war is too costly to continue. -- <i>Hammes, Ibid.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the government monopoly of force advocates of CSGV, I would like to point
out that it is impossible to nuke an idea to extinction, especially on your own
soil.</p>

<p>Hammes concludes the chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fourth-generation-warfare opponents focus on the
political aspects of the conflict. Because the ultimate objective is
changing minds of of the enemy's political leadership, the intermediate objectives
are all milestones in shifting the opinion of the various target audience
audiences. They know that time is on their side, Westerners in
general, and Americans in particular, are not known for their patience.
We are not a people who think in terms of struggles lasting decades.
Fourth-generation-warfare enemies will not seek immediate objectives but a <span style="color: red;">long</span> term shift in the political will of their
enemies. They will accept numerous tactical and operational setbacks in
pursuit of the goal.</p>

<p>Colonel Harry Summers noted in his book On Strategy: A Critical Analysis
of the Vietnam War that after the war he told a North Vietnamese colonel that
the United States
had never been beaten on the battlefield. The North Vietnamese replied,
"That is true. It is also irrelevant." It is essential to
understand that 4GW opponents do not focus on swift battlefield
victories. They focus on long term strategic approach. They focus
on winning wars, not battles.</p>

<p>-- <i>Hammes, Ibid.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an American civil war between an ideas-based Three Percent and a
disarmament-bent federal government, who then would lose interest first?
You cannot destroy an idea, not even an obviously bad and evil one -- witness
collectivism in all its forms. And Hammes further points out <i><u>"At the operational
level, all an opponent has to move is ideas.</u> (Emphasis supplied,
MBV.) He can do so through a wide variety of methods, from email to snail
mail to personal courier to messages embedded in classified
advertisements. He will try to submerge his communications in the noise
of the everyday activity that is an essential part of modern society. It
will be extraordinarily difficult to detect the operational level activities of
a 4GW opponent." (Page 218.)</i></p>

<p>Yes, it will. Especially in a civil war set in your own highly-developed
country.</p>

<h4>Potential 4GW Civil War Targeting: The Federal Government's and the Three Percent's</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Military Target (ordnance)</p>

<p>Any industrial plant, city, or other object, or any person, group of
persons, or force marked as a target for destruction, damage, injury, or
capture because of its direct or indirect use in the conduct or support of an
enemy's military endeavor.</p>

<p>In restricted usage, a military person, force, installation, or area
marked as a target because of its use, or potential use, in direct military
operations.</p>

<p><i>McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms, 6E, Copyright
© 2003</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition is made obsolete by 4GW because "direct military 
operations"
are precisely what the 4GW insurgent seeks to avoid. His target is
the
mind and the will of the political leadership of his enemy -- to be 
specific, the few inches between their ears which are filled with brains
to be influenced or, if not, popped like a grape with an unanswerable 
rifle shot from distance as an example to the others.</p>

<p>Let us make an example of the difference by briefly war-gaming the American
Revolution using present-day 4GW tactics.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/bushnellsturtle.jpg" alt="David Bushnell's Turtle" width="320" height="297"/></br>
David Bushnell's Turtle</p>

<p>Early in the war, the following incidents occur:</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin arranges a coordinated attack by David Bushnell in his
submersible and John Paul Jones in the Ranger on English commercial
shipping in the Thames estuary -- right at the King's doorstep in full view of
horrified Englishmen who never thought the war would come there. Bushnell
has greater success against the commercial shipping because their wooden hulls
are not copper-sheathed as are British military hulls. This "infernal
device" which strikes without warning or even apparent effective countermeasure
frightens British shippers. Bushnell, John Paul Jones and his surviving
crew are taken prisoner, but the very destructive raid, which also sets a large
portion of the London docks ablaze, is just as stunning, if not more so, than
the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in 1942.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/johnpauljonesRanger.jpg" alt='The Ranger' width="320" height="213"><br/>
The Ranger</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Franklin dispatches a trio of
riflemen by way of a neutral port into London.
One fine day, when Lord North emerges from his country estate, he is killed by
an aimed shot from 300 yards away. His wife, standing next to him, is
unharmed. <i>(NOTE: Lord North is targeted, but not the King. Under 4GW
rules the King would be sacrosanct, just as an American President in the 21st
Century would be. Anyone around them, however, would be fair 4GW targets
if involved in the decisions or operations which oppress their own
people. Remember, the point of 4GW is to destroy the will of the enemy
elite to proceed with the war, not give them motivation to win, or provide them
a propaganda coup to use with the people.)</i> After North is replaced, the
replacement King's minister is shot as well in identical circumstances.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Franklin activates a third group
already living quietly in England
to attack by arson the buildings of the British East India Company, Lloyds of
London and the Company of the Bank of England. They do this at night so
there are no civilian casualties, although several adjoining structures are
inevitably destroyed as well.</p>

<p>The attacks by John Paul Jones &amp; Bushnell are (barely) within the rules of
war and Franklin
takes credit for them. The others are plausibly deniable. British
merchants and politicians get the point, however. This war against the
American revolutionaries is going to cost them far more than they ever
dreamed. How long would they have supported the King's North American
obsession when they were cumulatively losing hundreds of thousands of English
pounds daily?</p>

<p>In addition, any federal government of the United States which wishes to make
war on its own people must overcome a few statistics unrelated to the Three
Percent or 4GW. The United
States is made up of 3.79 MILLION square
miles with somewhere around 315 million people living there. This makes
it the third largest nation in the world by both land area and
population. There are, not unimportantly, something on the order of 100
million firearm owners scattered across our vast country and about 200 to 300
million firearms.</p>

<p>By comparison, Iraq is only
168,754 square miles in area (about the size of the state of California) with only 31 million in
population. Afghanistan
is a bit bigger with 250,000 square miles in area and a population also of
around 30 million. What kind of bloody-minded fool would deliberately
ignite an insurgency in a country -- especially his own -- 9 times larger than
both of those combined and containing 5 times the population, many of them
armed and skilled at the use of those arms?</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/predator-firing-missile4.jpg" alt='Predator Firing Missile' width="320" height="240"/></p>

<h4>"Decapitation"</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>"Don't you ever stand for that sort of thing. Someone ever tries to kill
you, you try to kill 'em right back." -- <i>Captain Malcolm Reynolds, Firefly,
2002.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After more than a decade in Afghanistan
and Iraq,
the American policy elite believes it has a pretty good bead on
counterinsurgency in 4th Generation Warfare which rests principally on one
tactic: decapitation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leadership decapitation is a high-profile tactic that
involves the capture or killing of top insurgent leaders. It is frequently used
against guerrilla insurgencies: in the past two centuries, top insurgent
leaders have been killed or captured in just under 50 percent of
counterinsurgency campaigns. Yet we know little about the nature of the
relationship between leadership decapitation and counterinsurgency
effectiveness. Is capturing or killing insurgencies' leader(s) an effective
tactic? Or is it counterproductive, radicalizing insurgent movements,
strengthening their resolve, and making them more difficult to defeat? Or does
it have no effect at all? The general consensus is that leadership
decapitation of guerrilla groups is ineffective. These conclusions should
give scholars pause: they are based on unsystematic research designs, minimal
empirical data, and incomparable units--usually terrorist organizations or
foreign leaders. Patrick Johnston, "The Effectiveness of Leadership
Decapitation in Counterinsurgency"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Johnston himself believes decapitation is effective and though he criticizes
the critics of decapitation, his work shows an almost entire ignorance of 4GW
which presumably decapitation is supposed to defeat. How does a drone
strike, for example, kill an idea? A broader consideration with a little
history is found at Michael Zenko's Politics, Power, and Preventative action
blog at the Council on Foreign Relations:</div>

<blockquote>
<p>The United
States did not always carry out targeted
killings (or assassinations) of perceived national security threats. To the
contrary, the norm against targeted killings outside of battlefield settings
was established by President Gerald Ford in 1976, when he issued Executive
Order 11905: "No employee of the United States Government shall
engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination." Until the late
1990s, U.S.
targeted killings were officially proscribed and rarely seriously considered or
authorized by senior officials.</p>

<p>When President Ronald Reagan was asked about the failed assassination
attempt of Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah in Beirut in March 1985, for instance, he
replied: "Never would I sign anything that would authorize an assassination. I
never have, and I never will, and I didn't." Actually, Reagan signed a
directive on November 13, 1984, that was interpreted as "truly a 'license to
kill' provision." Sixteen years later, U.S.
ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyk stated: "The United
 States government is very clearly on the
record as against targeted assassinations. They are extrajudicial killings, and
we do not support that." However, after the U.S.
embassy bombings in Africa in August 1998,
President Clinton issued three top-secret Memoranda of Understanding
authorizing the CIA to kill Osama bin Laden and several key lieutenants--if they
resisted capture.</p>

<p>Despite these exceptions, U.S.
targeted killings were extremely rare. Since 9/11, however, targeted killings
in nonbattlefield settings steadily grew under President George W. Bush--roughly
50 between November 2002 and the end of his second term--and exploded under
President Barack Obama--almost 350 and counting.</p>

<p>As some operations are covert--when the lead executive authority is the
CIA--while others are obliquely acknowledged with few specifics--when it is the
Department of Defense--there are ethical, moral, and legal questions that have
gone unaddressed, due partly to lack of public debate and congressional
hearings. Just as there remains intense disagreement among former officials
about whether enhanced interrogation techniques (i.e., torture) against
suspected terrorists "worked" to produce useful and/or actionable intelligence,
it is difficult to know whether U.S. targeted killings are a successful and
sustainable means of achieving U.S. short- or long-term strategic objectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zenko's column consulted several experts, including Johnston. Among them, Daniel
Byman, a professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University and
the research director of the Saban Center at Brookings, the author of A High
Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Targeted killings work--just not in all places and at
all times. They can steadily attrite a terrorist group's leadership and, over
time, leaving it with fewer impressive leaders and fewer skilled personnel.
Their biggest impact, however, is often in what the terrorist organization does
not do. Leaders must spend their time hiding and changing locations in order to
survive. They must curtail phone communications and avoid interacting with
large groups of followers, all of which make them far less able to guide the
organization, inspire followers, and enforce their will. Leaders often
instigate witch-hunts in order to go after supposed traitors who provided the
lethal intelligence, further reducing the group's effectiveness.</p>

<p>Targeted killings, however, are a tactic, not a strategy. The inevitable
civilian deaths that occur can at times, but do not always, create significant
numbers of additional enemies as well as carrying a moral burden. And
politically it is tempting to ignore the broader dimensions of counterterrorism
and counterinsurgency as long as bad guys are dying on a regular basis. These
faults and limits, while serious, should not lead to the rejection of targeted
killings but rather a recognition of its costs and why alone they will not
suffice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this shows an imperfect understanding, even by Al Qaeda and the Taliban,
of 4GW. 4GW does not require organizations to be successful, merely the
transmission of ideas to independent actors of like beliefs who organize
locally and attack locally, even if the targets are of national or even
international, significance.</p>

<p>Sarah Holewinski, executive director of Center for Civilians in Conflict, a
human rights advocate and critic of U.S. drone policy, comes closest to
understanding the limited use of decapitation in a 4GW world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They may kill some of the people they're intended to
kill some of the time. But as a stand-in for long-term counterterrorism policy,
covert drone strikes in particular may be doing more harm than good to national
security. They're supposed to rid the United States of enemies without
the cost of troop lives or the muck of a traditional invasion.</p>

<p>But on the other side of the balance sheet, drone strikes are creating
anger--not only among locals in Pakistan and Yemen, but among people elsewhere
who want an excuse to hate America. Even for America's
fans, strikes call into question U.S. commitment to responsible use
of force, thanks to the information vacuum around who can be targeted, why,
under what legal framework, and how CIA and Special Forces protocols protect
civilians.</p>

<p>A fight worth fighting comes with sacrifice. Drones have relieved much of
the sacrifice born by the soldier but not the civilian, who lives in constant
fear of sudden death. Regardless of civilian casualties, which are highly
disputed, the psychological trauma, displacement, and suspicion among neighbors
of colluding with one side or the other has turned communities into war zones,
even with no visible boots on the ground. No wonder ordinary people are
chanting "Death to America"
after strikes.</p>

<p>There are no numbers on how many formerly agnostic civilians are now
skeptical about U.S.
power nor how many terrorists may arise as a result of the current drone
policy. That X factor is reason enough to pause before claiming a
counterterrorism panacea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The American people are largely supportive of decapitation as applied in Afghanistan and elsewhere, but what happens when
the targets are in Marion, Ohio
or Salt Lake City, Utah? What happens when the killings of
their friends and neighbors go on and on because the federal government can
think of no better way to compel obedience to unjust, unconstitutional diktats
contrary to the Founders' Republic?</p>

<p>Back on 17 September 2009, in a column on my blog Sipsey Street Irregulars, I
noted Patrick Johnston's embrace of decapitation strategies -- "Dark Thoughts
-- Misadventure, Spasm &amp; Decapitation. How I spent Constitution Day" -- and
commented on how, hypothetically, that might play out. </div>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, once started, the regime will find it
almost impossible to stop on any terms besides their own unconditional
surrender as they would be fighting an enraged but dispersed network
insurgency. It is likely that after a few weeks of such blood-letting, the
administration will be unable to find anybody left alive with sufficient
influence among the insurgents with whom they can negotiate an end to the
horror. The fact of the matter is that they would have done their best to kill
the folks they would need to stop what they started.</p>

<p>And they will want to stop it, oh, yes, out of concern for their own
miserable hides if nothing else.</p>

<p>For they will have provoked a conflict that will not be directed at the
war-fighters, the grunts, even those in the outnumbered federal police, but
rather at the war-makers, i.e. themselves.</p>

<p>In this they have only Bill Clinton to blame. When the Philanderer in
Chief, frustrated with Serbian intransigence in 1999, changed the rules of
engagement to include the political leadership, news media and the intellectual
underpinning of his enemy's war effort, he accidentally filed suit under the
Law of Unintended Consequences. The Serbians knuckled under, yes. But the rest
of the world took note, including (the Three Percent). I assure you, the appeal
to the higher court of history in that case has yet to be decided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Decapitation, I have tried to explain to people, works both ways in 4GW.
I continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Johnston is as wrong as he can be when comparing past
history to 4th Generation warfare, distributed networks and leaderless
resistance, especially as will be practiced in the United States if it ever
goes to war with itself.</p>

<p>He is wrong, but the powerful men and women he is writing for think he's
right.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, in the situation the administration would find
itself after Waco
Two, the "decapitation" strategy would for them more resemble Russian
Roulette played with an automatic pistol.</p>

<p>Hypothetical: They kill some of (the Three Percent), at first
accidentally perhaps, but almost immediately thereafter intentionally. The
spasm of defensive killing begins, targeted at their leadership. They spasm in
return. They would not be able to scuttle into their "green zones"
fast enough. For each clumsy attack on (the Three Percent), they receive a
lesson in the 500 meter war, one bullet (or many bullets) at a time. They
commit "collateral damage" of our innocents, (the Three Percent)
stay(s) within the rules of engagement and kill only war-planners and
war-wagers.</p>

<p>I have asked this question before. <u>They will fight to the last ATF agent
or to the last oath-breaking soldier. Will they fight to the first senior
bureaucrat, the second Congressman, the third newspaper editor, the fourth
Senator, the fifth White House aide? Can they stand Bill Clinton's rules of
engagement?</u></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what 4GW means in an American civil war in the 21st Century. Can
you understand now why I am trying to get that "useful dire warning" out to as
many people as possible? Only if both sides understand the
possibility of bloody civil war can it be avoided.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Which brings us to today.</p>

<p>Once again we hear demands for bans on semi-automatic rifles and for federal
control of all private transfers of all firearms (the so-called "gun show
loophole"). This time, it is said, there will be no "grandfather clause"
of existing weapons and that confiscation of all military-pattern semi-auto
rifles is intended.</p>

<p>Yet the Three Percent will not obey such laws and they will defy the federal
government to do anything about it.</p>

<p>I was once told by a "gun safety" advocate back in the Nineties that he favored
total civilian firearms confiscation. Only the military and police should
have weapons he averred and what did I think about that? I began to give
him a reasoned answer and he cut me off with an abrupt, "Give me the short
answer." </p>

<p>I thought for a moment and said, "If you try to take our firearms we will kill
you."</p>

<p>It was true then, it is true now.</p>

<p>The "arbitrarians" believe that
they can continue to encroach upon the liberty and property of their fellow
Americans without consequence to them. They cannot.</p>

<p>When democracy turns to tyranny, the armed citizen still gets to vote -- with
his rifle. Any grasping would-be tyrant who ignores that truth does so at
his or her own peril. </p>

<p>I pray, then, that <i>Absolved</i> is
viewed as a useful dire warning in time to prevent the Fourth Generation Civil
War it describes.</div>

</blockquote>

<p>So reads the plaque on Phil Gordon's wall in his Sipsey Street home the 
moment before all hell breaks loose. In <i>Absolved</i>, I try to explore 
the depths of Locke's belief to discover where it might lead us in the 
near future.</p>

<p>Since I began posting chapters of <i>Absolved</i> on the 
'net, I have been the recipient of many emails - some laudatory, some 
critical. I have been taken to task by some for killing off all my 
characters, for example. I can tell you that while my novel, like war, 
has its casualties, I "kill off" no one in my tale who either doesn't 
deserve it or who isn't willing to make the trade for what they perceive
 to be the greater good. Like all wars, there are "collateral" 
casualties. It would not be believable if there weren't. I can only 
tell you that I am not bloodthirsty. Writing about this subject 
actually depresses me. I have a son and two teenage daughters, all of 
whom I am immensely proud. My son in turn has two sons of his own. I 
want to live long enough to sing all my grandchildren to sleep to the 
tunes of <i>Hobo's Lullabye</i>, <i>Bold Fenian Men</i>, <i>Rising of the Moon</i> and <i>the Minstrel Boy</i>, just as I did with my own children.</p>

<p>Another civil war in this country is the last thing I want.</p>

<h4>"The Useful Dire Warning"</h4>

<p>So why write about one? Perhaps, as David Brin, author of the magnificent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postman-Bantam-Classics-David-Brin/dp/0553278746/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216785069&amp;sr=8-2">The Postman</a> (which bears no resemblance to the Costner cinematic flop), wrote in a forward to a reprint of Pat Frank's classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alas-Babylon-Pat-Frank/dp/0060741872/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216785108&amp;sr=1-1">Alas, Babylon</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Two books that emerged at roughly the same time as <i>Alas, Babylon</i> were Eugene Burdick's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fail-Safe-Eugene-Burdick/dp/088001654X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216785223&amp;sr=1-1"><i>Fail Safe</i></a> and Peter George's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fail-Safe-Eugene-Burdick/dp/088001654X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216785223&amp;sr=1-1"><i>Red Alert</i></a>, which later inspired Stanley Kubrick to make the magnificently humorous and thoughtful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strangelove-Learned-Stop-Worrying-Special/dp/B000055Y0X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1216785328&amp;sr=8-2"><i>Dr. Strangelove</i></a>.
 As archetypes of the useful dire warning, each dissected a specific 
possible failure mode, bringing it to the awareness of so many that, 
ironically, their particular type of debacle became much less likely. 
Indeed, the "self-preventing prophecy" may be the highest and most 
useful species in all of the vast, imaginative genus of speculative 
fiction. In much the same way that Orwell's <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=2469109905542911409"><i>1984</i></a>
girded millions against "Big Brother," these tales may have helped to 
keep their own nightmares from coming true. In other words, our most 
vivid nightmares may have been utterly practical, helping to save our 
lives. -- <i>David Brin, Foreward to the First Harper Perennial Modern Classics Edition of Pat Frank's 'Alas, Babylon', 2005, p. X.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the things about <i>Absolved</i> that has come in for both praise and 
criticism is the deadly details. When Phil Gordon or Kraut Mueller 
craft improvised rifle grenades, you can tell from the sometimes 
mind-numbing detail that it is certainly possible to do so. When 
thousands of Brightfire mercenaries-in-training are crushed under a 
fuel-air-explosive delivered by crop duster, you believe it is possible 
because, frankly, it IS. They say to write about what you know, and 
although in most cases I have not personally done the things that my 
characters in the book do, I have done enough research to know that it 
can be done.</p>

<p>There are characters in the book (most of them in 
fact) who resemble real people, or composites of two or three real 
people, who I have actually known. For example, "The Flying Dutchman," 
introduced in a future chapter is a sure-'nuff real smuggler pilot, a 
larger-than-life character I met a long time ago in a galaxy far, far 
away, as they say. He represents the archetype of the smuggler as 
freedom fighter just as much as John Hancock, Dr. Syn, Han Solo, Malcolm
 Reynolds or the grocery stock-boy Dale in the canceled CBS television 
series, Jericho. Like Hancock, however, the Flying Dutchman has the 
advantage of being a real American. If I place him in fictional 
circumstances, he reacts the way he would in life, I think. If he 
dislikes my representation of him, I'm sure he'll let me know. After 
I'm done, you may play the game of 
pin-the-caricature-on-the-real-jackass to your heart's content and those
 who know me best will no doubt be able to pick out characters who I 
have patterned on them.</p>

<p>Take Kraut Mueller, for example. Like 
the fictional Kraut, I have played a cat-and-mouse game with the ATF 
since the 90s. There is, I confess, more than a slight resemblance 
between us. Even so, Kraut is a better man than me, smarter, more 
aggressive in his actions, and more competent. The real me is not half 
as interesting as Kraut. If I were to try to cook up shaped charges in a
 basement, I'd be dead already. Frankly, I'm a klutz.</p>

<p>But the 
vignettes that will hopefully coalesce into a narrative that flows from 
the terrible opening to a logical conclusion (and a good read in 
between) are also presented with such detail for a purpose. If this 
book is to operate as a "useful dire warning," then both real sides in 
my imaginary civil war (and they are VERY real, just ask David Olofson 
and his victimized family -- for them this war has already started and 
is NOT imaginary) must be able to recognize the real threat to avoid 
it.</p>

<p>In this, I am frankly writing as much a cautionary tale for 
the out-of-control gun cops of the ATF as anyone. For that warning to 
be credible, I must also present what amounts to a combination field 
manual, technical manual and call to arms for my beloved gunnies of the 
armed citizenry. They need to know how powerful they could truly be if 
they were pushed into a corner.</p>

<p>Both sides must get the point in order to avoid conflict.</p>

<p>I
 hope that when I'm done, <i>Absolved</i> can perhaps take its place 
alongside these other "useful dire warnings." Being a practical man, 
however, I recognize that this is but a glimmering hope. Events rush 
by, pushing us like rudder-less boats in a strong current to where we 
know not.</p>

<p>A peaceful pool?</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p>The thunderous cataclysm of a deadly falls?</p>

<p>Perhaps, in the wicked light of the Olofson case, the latter is more likely.</p>

<h4>The Unintended Inspiration</h4>

<p>When completed my book will be dedicated, as most books are, to the one 
person, or persons, who made it all possible. Oh, I will have a Forward
 thanking all the folks who have assisted me in my project, of course. 
Chief among these will be my long-suffering wife Rosey, my kids, other 
gunnies and fellow workers in the thankless task of trying to restore 
our tottering constitutional republic.</p>

<p>But I think I will be 
dedicating <i>Absolved</i> to "Waco Jim" Cavanaugh and Special Agent Jody 
Keeku of the ATF, the blundering, deadly yet unintended inspiration for 
all my work. For most of you, neither needs an introduction. For the 
rest of you, the very moniker of "Waco Jim" should tell you the larger 
portion of his sins. Keeku was the principal agent of David Olofson's 
frame-up and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Whether my novel is a prescient 
glimpse into a bloody future or a "useful dire warning" that is heeded, 
is entirely up to the likes of them and the corrupt politicians who hold
their leashes.</p>

<p>It is they who by their conduct will absolve us 
of any further obedience to an oppressive regime. And as I point out in
<i>Absolved</i>, if the law no longer protects us, then they will find to 
their sorrow it does not protect them either.</p>

<p>The choice is theirs.</p>

<p>So I dedicate <i>Absolved</i> to them and their thuggish fellow gang members of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>

<p>As Ho Chi Minh once observed, "Cherish your enemies - they teach you the best lessons."</p>

<p>I hope they understand that before it is too late.</p>

<p>Phil Gordon felt old, sick, tired and cranky. Cancer did that to you, but he
didn't have to like it. Still, Phil had one more thing to do before 
crossing the bar and he prayed to the God of Abraham that he would have 
the time and the strength to do it. He shifted in his recliner, taking 
in the photographs on the side wall, a life in brief, partially 
illuminated by the soft glow of the porch light angling in through the 
windowpane above the front door. </p>

<p>Sitting in the dark, with 
the pictures shadowed in whole or in part, Phil couldn't see the 
details. He didn't need to. He knew them by heart.</p>

<p>It was all
there -- his grandparents and great grandparents, stiff and formal in 
the manner of folks born in the 19th Century, his mamma and daddy in 
their youth. There he was with his parents at the ceremony when he 
graduated from Basic, and again, standing in the A Shau Valley with his 
squad, all of them so young and full of bravado. There was his wedding 
photo with Claire, and the honeymoon picture at Natural Bridge, still 
another of that sun-dappled afternoon with her at Smith Lake. Then there
 were those of the kids, still young, ranked by age. There was the time 
when his oldest son Bobby had competed with him at Camp Perry, and 
Bobby's graduation from West Point. A pink frame held Sissy in her 
scrubs during medical school, and from a steel-gray one Johnny smiled 
out front of his technology company in Huntsville, with Sally at his 
side and little Phil, Matthew and Gabriel at their feet. Then there was 
his retirement party at U.S. Pipe, more recent pictures of the 
grandkids, and the last reunion of his Army unit. It was all there, 
where he'd come from, where he'd been and where he was going. The dusty 
frames covered the wall above the sofa, in a room that had seen so much 
loving, laughter and then, sadness.</p>

<p>Phil took all of them in,
those he could see and those he couldn't, closed his eyes and sighed. 
Well, it was a life. God had been very, very good to him. Still, he 
resented this last business of cancer breaking him down brick by brick. 
He knew he could bear it, it wasn't that. The pain, the gradual loss of 
functions, the bone-deep weariness, all were within his ability to 
stand. </p>

<p>It had hurt worse when he'd been hit in Vietnam. He'd 
been more helpless back during his recovery at Walter Reed. And he'd 
been weary beyond belief humping an M-60 machine-gun up and down the 
Central Highlands. Cancer came close to leaving him that tired but he 
didn't think it would be worse given the time he had left. Besides, ever
since he'd lost Claire to a drunk driver from Mexico City, he'd been 
ready to lay down his burdens and go home to join her. He wasn't Job, 
but he could take it. But he was afraid, he admitted, that he wouldn't 
have enough left in him to do what now had to be done. It was a duty and
he was stuck with it. </p>

<p>"Sometimes you're just stuck with the
duty." His daddy had told him that when he was six and he had asked why
he, Phillip Sheats Gordon, the youngest of seven sons, had to go out 
and fetch the firewood on a cold morning in Winston County when his lazy
brothers were still snug in bed.</p>

<p>Sometimes you're just stuck
with the duty. The Master Sergeant had told him that, too, just before 
he died on that no-name ridge near the Cambodian border. How long had it
been, now? His mind dulled by the pain pill, Phil couldn't do the math.
Long time, for sure. Hard to believe. The battalion had been strung 
out, looking for NVA supply caches when the Nathaniel Victors hit back 
hard. Under a barrage of mortars, recoilless rifles and RPGs, they 
overran the leading company. The air-cover was a little bit uncovered at
that particular moment, and somebody had to slow down the remorseless 
sons of Uncle Ho until the battalion got its excrement together.</p>

<p>So, the battalion top-kick, one Master Sergeant Walter McCoy, took over 
Phil's platoon from the shaky lieutenant who had only been in country 
two weeks and who still didn't know crap from breakfast. With McCoy's 
leadership they'd stopped the bastards cold. Of course, it cost them 
most of the platoon, the still-bewildered lieutenant and Master Sergeant
McCoy.</p>

<p>While they were digging in before the fight, McCoy 
had walked the line making sure the holes were sited properly and the 
M60s had clear fields of fire. As he walked by, Phil complained to 
nobody in particular, "Why us?" McCoy, a veteran of three wars and wise 
in the ways of killing, stopped, looked down at him and replied kindly, 
"Son, sometimes you're just stuck with the duty."</p>

<p>Phil was 
thunderstruck that he should hear his own daddy's words repeated back to
him there, then, at that place so far from home when all their lives 
seemed forfeit. It seemed to him an omen, a talisman. It was reassurance
that somehow, some way, he would make it out alive. He did. A buck 
sergeant, Phil was the senior surviving NCO when the NVA finally 
withdrew, leaving the ridge and the valley below strewn with their dead.
When he saw McCoy's body after the fight, Phil sat down beside it and 
wept. He had never been in a position to be close to the top-kick, but 
now it seemed as if his own father had been killed.</p>

<p>"Son, sometimes you're just stuck with the duty." Phil could see McCoy's 
leathered face even now, softness at the edges of its perpetual, 
hard-set scowl. He could see the wisdom, the love, in his eyes. Phil 
shook his head, shuddering like a dog throwing off the rain. Enough of 
memory lane. He was stuck with the duty and he would fight. And he had 
no doubt he would die and that would be a good thing.</p>

<p>He looked around the battlefield that had been his home, and carefully 
raised himself out of the recliner. It wouldn't do to fall and break a 
hip now. Company was coming, and he had to be ready to greet them. He 
hoped it would be today. He had been scared of the attacking Nathaniel 
Victors, the whistles and the bugles, the explosions and the screams. 
With his whole life ahead of him then, he wanted to live. But now, at 
the end of his life, he wasn't afraid of the thugs who had targeted him.
He was only afraid that they wouldn't come.</p>

<p>He had known that that they would get around to him sooner or later. He'd run his 
mouth too much. He was too political. He'd made his disdain for the 
thugs and their gang plain enough and now they were going to settle 
accounts. Frank Grant had met him at the pharmacy last month. The thugs 
had been asking about him, Frank said. What guns did he own? Did he have
any machine-guns? They knew that Phil had held a blaster's license 
since when he worked in construction after the war. Did he have any 
explosives? Frank had been Phil's good friend for forty years. Yet when 
he assured Phil that he had told the thugs nothing, even after they'd 
turned his shop upside down, Phil wasn't sure. The fear on Frank's face 
was evident. The fact that he had hung around the drugstore to 
"accidentally" run into him, rather than calling him or coming over, 
spoke volumes.</p>

<p>Not that Phil blamed him. The thugs WERE 
scary, made more so because they operated under color of law. They 
controlled the justice system. The local cops, the state police, all 
deferred to the thugs, scared that they too would come under scrutiny 
and attack. There was no reason to expect a fair trial these days. 
Juries convicted innocent men and women based on the word of paid 
informers or friends of the thugs and suborned prosecutors who refused 
to turn over exculpatory material to the defense, denying that it had 
ever existed. The rule of law no longer applied. Now it was the rule of 
man, which is to say, the law of the jungle. Phil smiled at the thought.
He had lived by the law of the jungle once and survived. He doubted 
that any of these young punk thugs had. Be careful what you wish for, 
you may get it. Phil chuckled. Oh, yes indeed.</p>

<p>It was still dark 
outside, early morning. That was no protection from the thugs, of 
course. They liked to do their evil work at night. They thought they 
owned it. Phil smiled. His sleep patterns had long ago been disrupted by
the pangs of the cancer that ate at his vitals, so he often did his 
sleeping in the daylight anyway.</p>

<p>Phil took three steps over 
to the sideboard, maneuvering around the coffee table with the surety of
a blind man on his own ground. Yet he wasn't blind, not even by the 
darkness. Above the sideboard hung a framed quotation from John Locke. 
It was one of his favorites. He could read it with the help of the 
PVS-14 night vision monocular he wore over his right eye.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Whenever the legislators endeavor to take away and destroy the property of the 
people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put 
themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon 
absolved from any further obedience." -- <i>John Locke</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Now would be a good time," Phil whispered in prayer. </p>

<p>God heard him.</p>

<p>The PSR1-A seismic intrusion detectors planted in the front yard that he 
first learned how to use in Vietnam began to crackle loudly through the 
speaker in the hall. Out back, his black lab Barney began to bark, then 
stopped with a yelp. The bastards, Phil thought, they always had been 
big dog killers. Phil instantly pivoted to look with his left eye at the
closed circuit TVs he had arranged in a bank in the open closet in the 
hall. There was another set in the kitchen, a third in his bedroom 
upstairs, and a fourth in the basement. </p>

<p>Armed and armored 
black-clad men tiptoed up his front porch. Another bunch stood ready by 
the back porch. Phil smiled, for two reasons. First, he wasn't going to 
have to wait to do his duty. And second, the thugs were set up in 
predictable attack formation (they called it a stack) just like the 
manual told them to. </p>

<p>He was sure they knew where he was in 
the house from his thermal signature. What they didn't see was the 
concrete block and sandbag fighting position he had built in the hall 
that covered both the front and back doors. As Phil darted into the 
miniature pillbox and kneeled, the porch lights went out as the power 
was cut. The TVs and cameras still operated on their batteries. Phil 
grasped the semi-auto M1918A3 Browning Automatic Rifle in the firing 
slit with his right hand and found the first button on the electrical 
control box with the index finger of his left hand. </p>

<p>Wait, he
thought, wait... The front door burst open. He pushed the button, 
brought his left hand up to the rifle's handguard and began to fire. The
BAR was loaded with 21 armor-piercing rounds, one up the spout and 
twenty in the magazine. He could have used an M-1 Garand (he had twelve 
in his collection before he parceled them out to his kids as birthday 
and Christmas presents), but the BAR had a greater magazine capacity and
he knew he had to get this bunch in one sweep. The thugs were all 
wearing military body armor. It didn't help them much. By the time Phil 
had emptied the magazine, the entire first stack of the raid party, save
one, was dead or dying. Some of the tungsten steel AP handloads had 
penetrated two thugs at once. Night vision devices splintered, kevlar 
helmets split, the trauma plates of their body armor were fractured and 
holed and their illusions of invincibility were swept away along with 
their sorry lives.</p>

<p>Save for the moans of the dying and the yelps 
of the wounded punk crab-scuttling away from the porch, it was silent 
when Phil reloaded, stood and ran to the rear entry window that flanked 
the back door. The rear stack was splattered all over the flower garden 
that Claire had planted with such devotion and love, some of them 
screaming, moaning, moving. </p>

<p>The improvised Claymore mine in the 
flower pot that he had detonated when the front door flew open had 
shredded them from the left side, leaving the rear door intact. Body 
armor and helmets had saved some from instant death. Phil fixed that by 
shooting through the shattered window, hitting each of them carefully in
 the head. A growing hail of small arms fire now peppered the front and 
rear of the house, most of the rounds expending their energies on 
sandbag and concrete block reinforcements along the walls or on 
freestanding steel doors positioned to cover the windows. Fire even 
penetrated the roof, coming from a helicopter which materialized 
overhead, only to be stopped by a two-ply thickness of military surplus 
kevlar blankets that Phil had spread out in the attic. </p>

<p>It had 
taken Phil a whole month to improvise his fort, telling inquisitive 
neighbors that he was strengthening his gun room in the basement against
potential thieves. Since the neighborhood had been going to hell of 
late, this was entirely believable. The thugs thought I was above my 
defenses, Phil mused. </p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>OK, Phil thought with 
satisfaction, their Plan A just dissolved in front of their eyes. Let's 
see how quickly they start to work on Plan B. There was one piece of 
unfinished business, however. To the left of where the pictures now hung
crazily in splintered frames (those that hung at all) the front windows
had been shattered by the bullets of the support detachment, whose 
ineffective fire had dwindled off to shocked silence.</p>

<p>That 
thermal imaging device had to be out there. Phil crept up on his hands 
and knees, staying below or behind the sandbags and doors. Edging up, he
 peeked out with his AN/PVS-14. The surveillance van was just about 
where he had envisioned it would be -- just twenty yards down the street
on this side. He could see the glow of the thermal imager on the face 
of the operator through the special glass of the back door. There was a 
small clot of thugs couched down to the side of the van but not under 
cover, looking on in unaccustomed horror at the bodies of their dead 
comrades scattered across Phil's porch and front steps, and at the 
crawling wounded man who hadn't yet made it to the sidewalk in front of 
the house. They did not try to help him.</p>

<p>Punks.</p>

<p>Phil 
ducked back, and a half-second later a burst of fire from across the 
street came through the space his head had occupied. Having determined 
his next targets, Phil crawled over to the steel door that most directly
fronted the window-hole facing the van and changed magazines. From his 
World War II-vintage BAR belt, he selected three magazines, two from one
pocket and one from another. All were loaded with an even mix of 
armor-piercing and armor-piercing tracer surplus rounds, originally 
produced to defeat the Germans and the Japanese. </p>

<p>Remember, he 
told himself, you're after body count as much as the van. When he opened
the large, reinforced mail slot in the steel door, his thermal 
signature was in full view of the thermal operator. It didn't save him, 
for he died about halfway through the first magazine, just shortly after
Phil cut the standing bunch of thugs in half. With the rest of that 
magazine and the following two, Phil sieved the van, its occupants and 
equipment, starting high and working low, finally exploding the gas tank
with .30-06 rounds intended for Mitsubishis and Focke Wulfes. Phil 
noted with satisfaction that even though almost seventy years old, they 
still worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Almost as an afterthought, Phil 
finished off the crawling thug with the last of his third mag. Rounds 
from the house across the street impacted the door, and one ricocheted 
off the mail slot door, causing Phil to flinch. I'll deal with you 
later, promised Phil.</p>

<p>As the riddled hulk of the van blazed and 
rocked with smaller secondary explosions, there were shouts of fear and 
panic at both ends of Phil's street. The thugs were pulling back to 
consider Plan B. And as much as he wanted to kill the shooter in Mrs. 
O'bannion's house, now Phil had to buy time in back. </p>

<p>When he
got to the rear of his house, he saw that some of the reserve thugs 
were cautiously working their way toward the back door, still thinking 
he was preoccupied in front. Had they been soldiers, they would have 
charged when they heard the BAR open up on the van. But they weren't 
soldiers, they were thugs. And they were surprised. No one had ever 
stood up to them like this. They were frightened. They were more worried
about reaching retirement age than what was happening in front of their
faces. So they were slow, they were tentative, and even with the raid 
commander shouting in their ears through their radio buds, they moved 
like molasses. </p>

<p>Phil had counted on that. What was it Sun Tsu
had said? "Know your enemy and you will fight a hundred battles and 
have hundred victories." Something like that. Well, Phil had no 
illusions. He knew this was going to be a pyrrhic victory -- his own 
personal Alamo -- but so far his study of the enemy had paid off. </p>

<p>He
proved it when he grabbed the Claymore clacker by the back window and 
blew up Claire's garden shed at the back of the property with a 
thunderous blast (it was just six sticks of dynamite packed in a barrel 
of ball bearings) that atomized the shed, turned the attackers inside 
out with the concussion and shrapnel and broke every window facing the 
alley (and some that weren't) for about a half a block around. </p>

<p>The
first blast at the back of the house hadn't registered in Phil's brain,
so concentrated had he been on the thugs coming in front door. But he 
heard this one all right -- heard it and felt it -- the concussion 
driving some of the air out of his chest and ball bearings and pieces of
 shed flying through every crack and crevice they could find or create, 
ricocheting off walls and steel doors.</p>

<p>One ball bearing tore a 
short groove sideways across his forearm and a long wood splinter stuck 
in his ass. Knocked back, scrambling, he broke it off, the point still 
in him. Crazily he thought, oh, well, it won't have time to fester. Ears
ringing, gasping, struggling for breath and fighting disorientation, 
Phil sheltered behind sandbags along the back wall. After a minute, he 
pulled out a battle dressing from his pants pocket and put it on his 
bloody arm. </p>

<p>Well, they got me. But then he laughed, 
realizing that it was really just a self-inflicted, John Kerry kind of 
wound. But how many have I killed? More than a dozen anyway, maybe two 
dozen. Not enough. Not enough by half.</p>

<p>Gotta be more if I'm gonna to make the point so everybody gets it. </p>

<p>OK,
time to cloud their vision. Phil low-crawled around the house on the 
first floor, pulling strings that he had run through eyelets screwed 
into the hardwood floorboards. The strings pulled loose from rolled-up 
space blankets installed at the top of every wall in the house. The 
space blankets, weighting with steel washers sewn at their bottom edges,
unrolled to provide full-length protection against being seen by 
thermal imaging devices (he'd already installed them under the roof the 
length of the house). Finishing the first floor, and ignoring the 
ineffectual, random shots from across the street, he ascended the stairs
and repeated the move in the equally hardened second floor rooms.</p>

<p>The
thugs were hampered, Phil knew, by the narrow spaces between the houses
in his neighborhood, which stood in an older part of town. Sooner or 
later, somebody in the gang's headquarters would suggest burning him out
like the FBI did at Waco. But would they burn down a half block of 
innocent folks' homes just to get to him? Questions would be asked by 
authorities they did not control. News coverage would broadcast it to 
the nation. Were they ready for that?</p>

<p>Well, this wasn't going
to be a drawn out siege and Phil wasn't going to hurt his neighbors if 
he could help it. Then he grinned. I've already blown the neighborhood 
to hell and gone and left dead bodies all over their nice lawns --maybe 
it's a little late to be worried about that, you think, Phil? </p>

<p>Still,
this wasn't going to be a long drawn-out siege. Phil would see to that.
He was, in military parlance, inside his enemy's decision-making cycle,
and he intended to stay there. He could hear sirens nearby now, and see
the reflected emergency lights of vehicles all over the place when he 
peeked around the barriers in front of the upper windows. The thugs 
would be gathering at their command vehicle by now, trying to figure out
what went so terribly wrong and how they could retrieve their 
reputations with their fellow gang members by killing Phil Gordon.</p>

<p>OK,
so get inside their heads. Everything went to crap, their first teams 
are dead, they've had to call in help, other gangs maybe. But they want 
to get this done. They will not pull back. The very top-ranking members 
of their gang will be huddled together at the command vehicle, trying to
fight through their horror and panic and figure out what to do. I can 
help them decide.</p>

<p>Phil pulled the rope on the folding stairs 
that led to the attic. Confident that he couldn't be imaged through the 
space blankets, he made his way over to a fighting position he had built
not far back from the eave. Weeks before, working at night, Phil had 
cut a section out of his roof, pulled it inside and mounted it on a 
hinged framework, thereby making a hatch in his roof. He did this front 
and back. The next day, went up on his roof and nailed shingles over the
gaps created, telling his neighbors that he had leaks that needed 
fixing. Now he eased that hatch up part way, propped it up with a stick 
and took a look up and down his front street. Down at the brightly lit 
intersection, just where he expected it to be, was the command vehicle, 
surrounded by armed thugs. Other gang members came and went. While he 
watched, a second van pulled up, then a tractor trailer. Perfect.</p>

<p>OK,
thought Phil, it's a math problem. First let's get a base number. He 
took the ITT range finder he had prepositioned there and lazed the 
center of intersection. The readout said 215 meters. Perfect. Just 
perfect. He brought out a plotting device he had made with a thin sheet 
of plywood and a magic marker. Setting it up to his right, he picked up a
Chinese-clone M14S rifle with a loaded magazine. On the end of it, Phil
had mounted an M76 grenade launching attachment. Twenty improvised 
fragmentation rifle grenades lay in a rack made from a large surplus 
metal 20mm ammo can built high into the position's sandbags. He had 
crafted them right after he heard he was on the gang's list. If they 
were going to treat him as no better than a terrorist, he might as well 
act like one -- within limits. Holding a rope that he had installed to 
the hatch's leading edge, Phil used the stick to push up the roof 
section until it began to swing down from the gravity. Using the rope he
eased the hatch down until it was fully open resting on the roof.</p>

<p>Slowly
rising, he peeked again from the perspective of where he would hold the
rifle's muzzle. Estimating the angle from one side of the large target 
to the other, he took two white cloth tapes with a thumbtack on one end 
and a washer weight on the other and stuck the thumbtacks into the pine 
of the roof. These would be his aiming stakes. Dropping back into his 
sandbag cocoon, Phil rested the butt of the M14 on the attic flooring, 
and fitted a rifle grenade on the launcher. The chamber was loaded with a
grenade blank, and the magazine held nineteen more. Twenty grenades. 
Twenty cartridges. Phil knew he would only be able to get away with this
once, so there was no point in worrying about a second fire mission. He
would be lucky to get all twenty off before he was killed.</p>

<p>Holding
the rifle at the angle prescribed by the plywood plotting device, he 
flicked off the safety with his index finger. Aiming with the left hand 
tape as his guide, he took a breath, let it out, and pulled the trigger.
With a "whoommpf" the rifle grenade was gone. Phil fell into the rhythm
of killing: his right hand cycled the operating rod, and ejected the 
spent grenade cartridge. He let the slide go and the next cartridge was 
loaded. Shifting the right hand to the rifle's rear grip, he grabbed a 
grenade with his left and brought the projectile down onto the launcher,
seating it firmly. His left hand went back to the forearm of the M14. 
He shifted the rifle, using the right tape as a guide for aim and the 
plywood for range. He had three rounds gone before the first one landed.
Using the tapes and the plywood, moving the muzzle randomly down and 
up, side to side, Phil hammered the intersection. </p>

<p>Looking 
from across the street, the gang snipers could not at first figure out 
what was happening. Had he somehow gotten out of the house to directly 
engage the bosses? Then one spotted the faint blip of the last grains of
burning powder that could be seen above the roof line. They began to 
fire, plastering the roof with small arms fire that became a general 
engagement. </p>

<p>Behind his sandbags and steel, Phil continued to 
launch the grenades. By the time he got to ten, all three vehicles were 
afire and the intersection was littered with bodies while sparks fell on
them from a mortally wounded transformer high up a power pole. Eleven, 
twelve, thirteen. The roof was being eroded above him, around him, swept
away by a leaden storm. Fourteen. Fifteen.</p>

<p>From down the street,
a thug fired the heaviest weapon that the gang owned, an M203 grenade 
launcher. He had not been trained to use it, so the first round passed 
over the house and detonated far down on the next street, killing a cop 
directing traffic. Because the house was not hit, Phil didn't notice it.</p>

<p>Sixteen. Seventeen.</p>

<p>He noticed the second 40mm round though. In fact, it killed him. </p>

<p>But Phil Gordon didn't mind. </p>

<p>He'd done his duty. </p>

<p>He was home with Claire and he got to meet his Maker, his Savior. Absolving, he was absolved.</p>

<p>The
gang never did get his guns though. When they tried to force the gun 
safe open in the light of day, it blew up, killing every agent within 
fifty yards of the place. In future, the gang resolved, they would 
never, ever, pick on somebody who had nothing to lose. In this 
resolution, they were to prove less than successful.</p>

<p>In Phil 
Gordon's pocket, they found a folded up piece of paper that, in part, 
said this: "But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing 
invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under 
absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off 
such Government, and provide new Guards for their future security." 
Across the bottom of the paper, Phil Gordon had scrawled a phrase in 
Greek: "Molon Labe."</p>

<p>Carl Elliott turned off the television. 
He'd seen more than enough. His client, his life-long friend, Phil 
Gordon was dead and he had taken at least 52 agents of the federal 
government with him. My God, what a slaughter. If old Phil's intention
had been to make a statement he'd certainly done that. Of course the 
feds and their talking heads were already spinning the facts of their 
raid. The ATF statements in particular described Phil in terms that 
were nothing less than bald-faced lies. Carl looked at the envelope on 
his desk one more time. It had been stuffed in the mail slot in his 
office door when he arrived on Monday. It was Phil Gordon's 
valediction, he knew. He did not want to open it.</p>

<p>At the same 
time, Kraut Mueller was opening a similar envelope in a safe house 
outside Oneonta, Alabama. He cursed his rotten luck. The federal 
operational security about the move against Phil Gordon had been just 
about perfect. Kraut smiled grimly. From the federal body count, it 
looked like that was about the only thing that had from their point of 
view. Still, there was no chance to go to Phil's aid or to get Kraut's 
militia unit on the Fed's backs before the whole thing was over. </p>

<p>Now,
he held Phil's instructions to him in his hands and after reading them a
second time he shook his head in grief and frustration. In the note 
that accompanied the DVD, Phil commanded him to do nothing in 
retribution. Nothing. "This is on me and me alone," Phil had written. 
"Exploit this politically. If this works the way I think it will, I'll
shock them down to their short and curlies. I've made an affidavit of 
the facts that led up to this and given it along with supporting 
documents to my lawyer, Carl Elliott. I've also made a statement on 
video and made a hundred copies. You've got one, Elliott has one and 
the other 98 are in a small duffel bag in a storage locker in Jasper. 
The key and the address are in the small brown envelope. Elliott also 
has a copy. Whichever of you gets there first, take the DVDs and mail 
them from at least ten different post offices. They are addressed to my
family, my gunnie friends and the news media. Don't go to guns just 
yet. It's like you always said, 'No Fort Sumters.' Watch and wait and 
let this develop. Good Luck, Phil."</p>

<p>So, what do I do? My guys 
are raging to strike back NOW. Hell, I want to strike back now. He was
still thinking that when he popped the DVD in the player.</p>

<p>"My 
name is Phil Gordon, and if you are watching this I am dead at the hands
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. They will tell you 
that I am, that I was, a crazy gun felon, and that they began 
investigating me because I possessed illegal weapons and was a threat to
the community. None of this is true. I have served my country, and 
lived all my life according to its laws, including those I didn't agree 
with because I felt they were unconstitutional. Despite this, the ATF 
has apparently decided to target me for my opinions. I have made no 
secret of my disdain for this agency, the unlawful way they conduct 
their business, the way they ruin the lives of citizens, framing and 
railroading them in corrupt federal courts. I am especially disgusted 
by the way they reward illegal behavior on the part of their agents, 
including the perjury before Congress of the present regional director 
of the ATF who sits in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>

<p>I have written many 
letters to the editor and to my congressman and senators over the years 
on these topics, and I believe that this is why they have decided to 
shut me up. I guess the First Amendment means as little to them as the 
Second. But the reason you're watching this is that shortly after they 
opened their investigation of me, a friend told me that I had been 
targeted. This gave me a choice. I am old, I have terminal cancer and 
my beloved wife Claire passed away last year. Although I would like to 
live longer to spend time with my wonderful sons and daughter and my 
precious grandchildren, I do not want their last memories of me to be 
from behind bars and armored glass at a federal prison. And if you 
wonder now why I did what I did, it's because no one, not me and not 
you, can count on a fair trial in the federal courts today. Numerous 
recent cases have proven that. So if I can't get a fair trial and I 
don't want to go to federal prison, I might as well fight it out on my 
doorstep when they come to get me.</p>

<p>They will call me a terrorist 
and a threat to the community. But THEY came to MY door. I did not 
threaten them, I did not target them for their unlawful behavior, nor 
have I ever threatened any of neighbors or fellow citizens. If I am 
dead it is because I merely defended myself. Despite their federal 
badges, the ATF is a gang operating under the color of law. If I am 
lucky and God grants my prayers, I will take a goodly number of these 
federal gangbangers with me when I go. Some of them will die in 
explosions and from improvised munitions. They will point to this as 
evidence of my law breaking. But the fact of the matter is that I hold a
blaster's license and may lawfully use explosives. Most of this 
material was purchased by me the day after I was informed I was an ATF 
target, and I have turned over the receipts and other supporting 
documentation to my attorney as proof of my statement. If I have used 
these explosives in unconventional ways to defend my life and my 
property, it was only because I knew that they would come for me in 
overwhelming force, totally unconcerned if they took me alive or not. I
merely returned the favor."</p>

<p>Phil shifted in his chair, and Kraut
noticed for the first time that he had set up the camera in the 
basement of his Sipsey Street home. You could just barely see the 
corner of his gun safe in the image's right background.</p>

<p>"There's 
something that happens to you when you realize that a portion of the 
federal government wants you dead, and part of it is that you cease to 
care about the laws that they use to oppress you. I'm sure my neighbors
are looking at their broken windows right now and blaming me. I guess 
that's fair. I am sorry for any damages they have suffered, but please 
understand that I didn't invite these thugs to our neighborhood."</p>

<p>Phil's face took on a harder look and he stared straight into the camera.  </p>

<p>"To
the American people I would like to say this. We do not have the 
government we deserve, but we do have the government we tolerate. We 
have tolerated the tyranny of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives for far too long. They only came to my house to kill me 
because YOU let them think they could get away with it. And if you 
don't arouse yourselves from your long sleep with this wake-up call that
I provide you with my death, they will one day be at your doors too. 
What will you do then?</p>

<p>To my gun-owning friends I would ask this:
Don't let your emotions get the better of you. Let my death and the 
deaths of the ATF agents I take with me be enough for now. Let the 
administration explain why they felt it necessary to attack me. Let the
government explain that to the widows and orphans of the agents who are
dead by my hand in legitimate self defense. This did not have to 
happen. Let them explain that to the country and the world. And if I 
am wrong and they don't take this opportunity to reconsider their 
actions, there will always be another time. But if those of you who 
know me, and who know that I am telling the truth, wish to honor my 
memory, honor my wishes too. Don't take another life for mine. 
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. Watch, and wait. Perhaps 
the administration will come to its senses. If not, as Locke says, you 
will be absolved by their further law-breaking of any duty to obey them.
 Then you can start shooting back. But not now. Not now."</p>

<p>Phil sighed.</p>

<p>"To
my children, Bobby, Johnny and Sissy, I can only say that I love you 
and your children, my grandbabies, with all my heart. I am sorry that I
have had to do this, and I know that you will suffer from the notoriety
and the press madness that defending myself will generate. If the ATF 
gave me any other choice, I would have taken it. But they didn't. I 
hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. Your mother and I 
will be waiting for you in Heaven. Goodbye for now."</p>

<p>Phil Gordon gave a slow, sad smile. His eyes glistened with tears.</p>

<p>The screen went black.</p>

<p>Kraut
Mueller was crying too. OK, Phil, we'll wait. You've given me the 
tool to stop the boys for now. "But for how long?" he asked aloud. 
"For how long?" The question echoed in the room. And no one, not God 
nor Phil Gordon, answered.</p>

<h4>January 22, 1945: The Depot</h4>

<p>It
was Monday and James Boatwright was late. He was late and he was cold. 
It was 19 degrees and he was chilled to the bone, and not just from the 
winter weather. As he hurried across Broad Street dodging traffic he 
slipped on the ice and almost ended up under a passing Ford cargo truck.
The military policeman at the Broad Street Gate was laughing as James 
recovered and slipped-slid through the crusty brown slush at the curb. 
Boatwright ignored the MP and rushed through the gate, running as fast 
as the snow and his worn-out shoes would allow until he launched himself
into the Intra-Depot Bus just as it was pulling out of "D" stop in 
front of the Depot headquarters building.</p>

<p>Had the MP not 
recognized him and allowed him to pass without checking his ID, 
Boatwright would have never made it to his desk on time. But the MP had 
been working his post for about three months now, and he knew Boatwright
to be one of the many department managers of the busy Columbus Army 
Service Forces Depot. In fact, though the MP did not know it, James 
Boatwright was one of a few of the Depot's 14,000 man (and woman) 
workforce whose seniority predated the war.</p>

<p>Built in 1918 on 281 
acres of swamp &amp; farm land well east of downtown Columbus, Ohio, the
Columbus Quartermaster Reserve Depot was well-sited to take advantage 
of three major railroad lines. By the end of "The War to End All Wars", 
the Depot had expanded to 25 warehouses. Most of these were dismantled 
after the war ended, and during the Twenties the Depot's mission became 
reconditioning war materiel for resale.</p>

<p>Renamed in 1930 as the 
Columbus General Depot, it was used during the Thirties as the District 
Headquarters for the "Triple Cs"--the Civilian Conservation Corps--for 
Ohio and West Virginia. Thus it was to the Columbus General Depot that 
in 1933, James Boatwright, hat in hand, applied for a floor sweeper's 
job. The fact that James was a veteran of the "Great War" helped him 
secure his position, as did the fact that his uncle had worked at the 
Depot since the groundbreaking in May, 1918.</p>

<p>If he ever felt 
guilty about using his family connection to get a job, James didn't 
remember it. It was the "Great Depression" and his family was just short
of eviction. Being hired by the Depot was the best thing that could 
have happened at the time, and certainly James had repaid his employers,
the taxpayers of the United States of America, with years of diligent 
hard work. When he had time to think about it (which wasn't often), 
James wondered if the current "Great War" would be followed by another 
depression. "I suppose we'll have to start numbering the depressions 
like we number the world wars now," James had grumbled to his wife just 
last week.</p>

<p>Then came Pearl Harbor, and the Depot workers knew 
they would be called upon to support the war effort just like 1918. They
had no idea, however, how large a task they would be asked to perform. 
It was a bigger war, with many fronts, and the demands of the services 
for arms and materiel were huge and insatiable. The Depot grew, and grew
again, buildings multiplying at a ferocious pace. In August, 1942, the 
Quartermaster General took over the Depot and it was renamed the 
Columbus Quartermaster Depot. In this war, the Depot would support all 
the services, not just the Army. Later that year, another 295 acres were
purchased and the building went on and on: more vast sheds, more rail 
sidings, more offices to handle the workload: Salvage Office, Lumber 
Office, Motor Maintenance, even Chemical Warfare. In 1943, its named had
been changed yet again to the Columbus Army Service Forces Depot, but 
to everyone who worked there it had always been, and would always be, 
simply called "The Depot."</p>

<p>Over 14,000 war workers now bustled 
across the Depot's nearly 600 acres at all hours every day, and some of 
them were prisoners of war. James never felt comfortable having POWs 
doing critical war work. It was all very well to use them on the farms 
growing grain and such. How much sabotage could they do there? But here,
at the Depot, with vast quantities of munitions passing through there 
were unlimited opportunities for criminal mischief. Oh, the Italians 
were trustworthy enough, James reflected. Once beaten, they stayed 
beaten and were more docile and agreeable than the native Americans who 
worked at the Depot. But the Germans... well, James Boatwright hadn't 
trusted a German since 1918 and he wasn't about to start. He kept a 
vigilant eye on the Germans in his immediate area and he constantly 
urged his supervisors and lead men to do the same. There hadn't been a 
case of sabotage in his area that he knew of, and there wouldn't be if 
he could make sure that the Germans were carefully watched. Not that the
Germans, or anyone else, had spare time to think up mischief. They were
too busy.</p>

<p>Five thousand rail cars entered and left the Depot 
every month. John Carmody, a friend of James' who kept track of such 
statistics from his office up front in the headquarters building, said 
that if all the cars were put end to end, by the end of the year they 
would form a train well over a thousand miles long. In February 1943 
alone the Depot had shipped over 53,000 tons of guns, ammunition and 
other ordnance supplies to the far-flung battlefronts. Carmody also told
Boatwright that the Quartermaster Section was shipping about ONE 
HUNDRED MILLION field ration meals a month. From fresh meat to 
antiaircraft guns, from clothing to bridge sections, from jeeps and 
trucks to medical supplies, the Depot took it in, inspected it, 
repackaged it, selected it, and shipped it on to its ultimate 
destination: the biggest war the world had ever seen.</p>

<p>On the wall
next to his desk was a clipping from the Depot newsletter, "The Log of 
Columbus." Almost two years old now, it read: "The gigantic task in 
which all of us are engaged to bring freedom again to the nations of the
world has been aptly called a war of supply. Never before has so much 
depended on keeping the tools of war moving to the fighting fronts. This
Depot is one of the most important links in the chain of supply." James
kept the small clipping as his own little war poster, for he believed 
every word of it.</p>

<p>Even before the war, the President had called 
the United States "the arsenal of democracy." Looking out the bus window
as he passed by the long sheds full to bursting, crated antiaircraft 
guns and searchlights sitting in the open storage areas and forklifts 
rushing to and fro, James Boatwright knew he was looking at just a small
portion of that arsenal. He was proud of the job he did, even if at the
moment he had no business doing it.</p>

<p>James Boatwright was sick. 
The flu had been going around, and James had caught a piece of it. His 
temperature at the moment was about a hundred and two. He had 
alternately chilled and burned for two days now. His wife had not wanted
him to go to work today, but he felt he had to. Not that today was any 
more important than any other day but merely because he knew that his 
sons, and a lot of other fathers' sons, were counting on the supplies 
that would move through the Depot this day. James wanted to make sure 
that his part was done right. And there wasn't one of his subordinates 
he could trust to keep an eye on all the many facets of his job.</p>

<p>So
when he made it to his desk, he hung up his hat and overcoat, put his 
lunchbox on the shelf and began to organize his day. First he had to 
clean up the mess. Over the weekend someone, probably that 4F kid Jimmy 
McKnight, had been using his desk as a combination dinner table and 
library reading room kiosk. There were crumbs everywhere. (Was that 
mayonnaise on his telephone handset?) Spread out across his desk was 
Saturday's edition of the Columbus Evening Dispatch. James didn't mind 
someone using his desk, but he darned sure wished they had the manners 
to clean up after themselves. Well, there was a war on, right? Standards
slipped in wartime, that was a given, so James merely sighed and began 
to sweep the crumbs into his wastebasket.</p>

<p>The newspaper drew 
Boatright's attention. He'd been too sick to read the paper the last 
couple of days and this was still news to him.</p>

<p>"REDS 204 MILES 
FROM BERLIN" screamed the headline in the Dispatch. "Five Red Armies 
Strike Nazis; Reich Invaded at Three Points," read the next line. 
"Simple Ceremony Marks 4th Term Inauguration," said a lesser headline in
the upper left corner, below which was a picture of the President being
sworn in by Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone. James sighed. Well, I didn't
vote for him, he thought.</p>

<p>Mr. Boatwright had drummed a practical
knowledge of the history of American constitutional jurisprudence into 
his son's head to supplement James' Catholic school education. And Mr. 
Roosevelt (his father had referred to him as "THAT man," until the day 
he died in 1937) had bent the Constitution into a pretzel to accomplish 
his "New Deal", even going so far as to threaten to pack the Supreme 
Court to coerce the justices into getting what he wanted. Many Americans
thought Roosevelt to be a deity only slightly lesser than Jesus Christ.
James had a different opinion. It was, however, a minority opinion. 
Well, that's democracy for you, James thought.</p>

<p>"Torpedoed Ship's 
Crew Strafed by Japanese," read the headline just above the fold. Just 
to the right of that tragedy was a story that caught James attention:</p>

<p>"Canadian Draftees Revealed AWOL"<br/>
Ottawa, January 20 (AP)<br/>
"Half
of a group of Canadian home defense soldiers drafted for overseas 
service went absent without leave before embarkation, and 6300 are still
at large, Defense Minister A.G.L. McNaughton disclosed today. Some 1500
of these 7800 returned voluntarily or were apprehended, he added, and 
about 500 of them sailed for Britain along with the others who did not 
take authorized leaves... the 6300 will be classed as deserters if they do
not return within 21 days."</p>

<p>Boatwright snorted in derision. 
Canucks. That figured. Such behavior squared with his own experiences 
with Canadians in the First World War. Shaking his head, his eyes 
scanned on down to "Casualties in Central Ohio". "Ah, blessed Heavenly 
Father, there's little Vic," James whispered.</p>

<p>"KILLED IN ACTION"<br/>
"Columbus -- Sea. 1c Enio John Centurini, 23, E. 3rd Ave, in the Pacific; Cpl. Victor R. Lake, 25, 2481 James Road, in Germany."</p>

<p>It
wasn't news to James, of course. The Lakes lived two doors down from 
the Boatwrights and Mrs. Lake had received the telegram over a week ago.
The government always delayed the press release of casualties so the 
families wouldn't suffer the shock of reading about it in the papers the
same time as their neighbors. Still, occasionally the telegram didn't 
get delivered to the right person and there was more than one father or 
mother or wife who read about the death of their little Jimmy or beloved
Johnny over morning coffee.</p>

<p>What a waste, James thought. Another
marvelous boy cut down in the spring of life, one of millions of such 
boys all over the world. Ah, God in Heaven, what a waste. All because of
the murderous greedy bastards who start the dirty stinking wars. The 
fires of Hell weren't hot enough for Hitler, Tojo and Mussolini. 
Stinking bastards. May they meet their Maker swiftly.</p>

<p>The war was
close to being over. That much was clear from the headlines. We were 
going to win the war, the only question uppermost in James' mind was how
many American boys lives would be required to end it, and would one or 
more of his three sons be among the fallen?</p>

<p>Hitler's last gasp 
had been that Battle of the Bulge thing. Surely that WAS his last gasp. 
He couldn't have another surprise like that up his sleeve, could he? But
then there were the Japs. One look at the map told you that they still 
were in a lot of places they had to pried out of, and we hadn't even got
close to the home islands yet. How horrific was that going to be?</p>

<p>"Jap
Resistance Mounts in Fury In Luzon Fight." Now this story drew James 
Boatwright's full attention. James' son Billy was a sergeant in the 37th
"Buckeye" Division. And the Boatwrights hadn't had a letter from Billy 
since last month.</p>

<p>"Tank Battles and Artillery Duels Flare Along Invasion Front" James read on down the column.</p>

<p>"Sisson
was captured after a nerve-wracking night in which Japanese pressed the
attack incessantly against American infantry and anti-tank guns pinned 
down by artillery firing from overlooking ridges. As soon as the 
Japanese armor withdrew, screaming Nipponese foot soldiers charged. They
were beaten off with losses to both sides... Similar tank and Banzai 
charges were reported elsewhere in the sector, where Japanese were 
burned out of 20 foot holes by flame-throwers..."</p>

<p>James stopped 
reading. Flame-throwers. Wasn't there something from last week about 
flame-throwers? Some unfinished business, he half-remembered. He 
discarded the newspaper into his trashcan, and began to survey his desk 
seriously for the first time. Rifling through his pending basket, he 
found it. There was a shipping order for twelve M2-2 flamethrowers. 
Let's see, James scanned the attached note. Ah, that was it. James rose 
and walked out his office door into the bedlam beyond. Scanning the 
frantic activity, he spied the man he was looking for corking off by the
water cooler, trying to make time with Betsy Sillers. James grinned. 
Sillers wouldn't give Chief Cooper McCarthy the time of day if he was 
the last man on earth. Betsy had sense.</p>

<p>"McCarthy! Come here for a second!" he yelled.</p>

<p>McCarthy,
a hard-drinking Irishman with an uncommonly big beer belly, danced 
across the shed runway, dodging a passing forklift. When he got within 
earshot he said, "Yeah. Boss?"</p>

<p>"Did you get those flame-throwers re-crated for shipment?" Boatwright asked.</p>

<p>"Uh, what flame-throwers?" McCarthy feigned ignorance.</p>

<p>"You know damned well which flame-throwers, McCarthy. The ones I talked to you about twice on Saturday."</p>

<p>James
didn't wait for a reply. "Now get your ass over to Shed 11 and get them
ready before I send you to the paymaster to pick up your last check."</p>

<p>Boatwright
executed an about face and went back into his office, leaving the Chief
Cooper spluttering what little he remembered of his father's Gaelic 
curses.</p>

<p>One of James Boatwright's principal duties was the 
supervision of the Freight Consolation station. Shipments from all the 
various sections of the Depot that were less than a carload were brought
to the FC station in the south end of Building 12. There it was sorted 
and consolidated to get the economical benefit of shipping in full 
carloads. Those flame-throwers that William O'Rourke McCarthy had been 
goldbricking on were all that was needed to fill out a railcar going to 
the port of Oakland where ships were destined for various points in the 
Pacific theater. And that shipment needed to leave today, if possible.</p>

<p>James scanned down the consolidated bill of lading, which contained some unusual items:</p>

<p>2 M55 Quad Fifty Caliber anti-aircraft machine gun trailer mounts, 
complete with 200,000 rounds of .50 caliber belted ammunition, ball, 
tracer, and armor piercing incendiary, as well as extra gun-mounted ammo
cans and spare barrels; 4 of the new M20 75mm Recoilless Rifles, tripod
mounted complete with direct fire sights plus 400 rounds of 75mm armor 
piercing and high explosive ammunition...</p>

<p>James guessed the first 
two items were "packaged" so they could go into immediate action. 
Although the destinations were different, they were probably both 
intended for the Philippine theater.</p>

<p>Then there was another big 
package. It consisted of 200 M3 .45 caliber submachine guns with 2,000 
magazines and 120,000 rounds of .45 caliber ball; 200 of the new M2 
Carbines with 2,000 magazines and 120,000 rounds of .30 Carbine ball 
ammunition; 100 M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifles with 1200 magazines; 
100 M1903A3 rifles with grenade launching attachments and crates of high
explosive, white phosphorus and antitank rifle grenades with launching 
cartridges; there were even more crates of Mark II hand grenades. For 
the Springfields and BARs there were 240,000 rounds of M2 ball 
ammunition packed in bandoleers and 5 round stripper clips. In addition,
there were boxes of web belts and ammunition pouches of the appropriate
types for all the weapons, in matching quantities going to the same 
address.</p>

<p>These had to be intended for some guerrilla group in 
Asia, thought Boatwright. Almost all shipments to U.S. military units 
were not bundled like this. They would ship whole boxcar loads of arms, 
other boxcar loads of ammo, and most often these would be shipped direct
from the manufacturers or arsenals which produced them. But there were 
plenty of places that the Japanese still held, and these items looked 
like they were packaged to enable them to be re-bundled without delay 
and dropped behind enemy lines. James had seen packages like this 
before, going to the ETO. (In fact, although Boatwright never knew it, 
those arms had been dropped to the French Maquis by the OSS. This 
package was intended for a particularly effective anti-Japanese partisan
group in French Indochina which the OSS had been working with for some 
time. Its leader was a little Communist named Ho Chi Minh.)</p>

<p>Then there was another line item that, like the 75mm Recoilless Rifles, James had never seen before.</p>

<p>There
were 20 M3 "grease guns" like the others in the "package" but these 
were being shipped with sound suppressors. Hmm, thought James, 
silencers. No magazines or ammo were included with this shipment so 
presumably the recipients would already have both.</p>

<p>And of course 
there were the twelve M2-2 flame throwers and 24 refill tanks, as well 
as organizational support maintenance kits. No fuel of course, that 
would be available wherever these were going. Sergeant Billy Boatwright 
had written his father about watching GIs of his division using these 
devil's backpacks on Jap pillboxes on Bougainville in March of last 
year. James shuddered to think of the sights his youngest son had seen. 
His own war had been terrible enough, but he suspected, no, he knew, 
that the scientific ingenuity of man had made this war even worse.</p>

<p>There
were more light items: bales of uniforms, anti-flash garments and hoods
for naval gunners, aircraft carrier deck signal paddles, pith helmets, 
mosquito netting and MP brassards as well as ping pong balls and paddles
headed for some USO or hospital. All of it was destined for the Port of
Oakland. James checked the total weight of the cargo, plus the space 
calculations. Yes, it was not too much over the 100.000 pound maximum 
gross for the 50'6&quot; long car (as measured internally) and the stuff 
would fit with some backing and filling by the POWs. (There was a time 
when James would have never considered loading a railcar more than the 
max, but this was war and there was a continual shortage of boxcars.) 
The balance would have to be right, not too much on one side of the car 
or the other. But the German POWs were usually pretty good at that, 
better than most of the Americans on the loading crew who worked the 
forklifts.</p>

<p>The POWs. James Boatwright grimaced. They would bear 
watching with this one. Give one unattended POW a minute to fool with a 
case of hand grenades and it could be Armageddon on his loading dock. He
would watch this one himself.</p>

<p>By the time McCarthy came back 
with the re-crated flame throwers (and it was record time for him), the 
loading of the railroad car was well under way, all under the watchful 
eye of James Boatwright. There was some trouble with the balance, but 
after taking some items off and rearranging them, it finally worked. 
They were just about to fit the last items in by hand when James 
Boatwright passed out and hit the dock floor as if he'd been pole-axed.</p>

<p>The
Depot medics were summoned and, with the assistance of the American 
lead man and his helper, carried James to the ambulance. Someone yelled 
at the POWs to "hurry up and finish the job goddammit!" In went the last
boxes and the door was sealed.</p>

<p>In the confusion, no one noticed 
Feldwebel Helmut Grass switch the bills of lading on the outside of the 
car with the next one up the track.</p>

<p>Helmut, recently of the 252nd
Panzer Grenadiers, had been waiting for such a moment for three months,
ever since he had been posted to the Depot. According to the Geneva 
Convention, POWs weren't supposed to be employed in war work but Helmut 
didn't mind. He figured (quite correctly) that Germany probably had 
American POWs doing war work back home, and besides, he thought that the
job would give him ample opportunity to help the Fuhrer and the 
Fatherland by engaging in a little sabotage.</p>

<p>Raised in the Hitler
Youth, Helmut was a big believer in the Fuhrer and the Fatherland. He 
liked to think he had remained faithful to his blood oath even after he 
was captured in Normandy. Even so, by the date of his capture on June 
13, 1944, Helmut's military ardor had cooled considerably. In fact, he 
had been hysterically happy to be captured. Flattened in a roadside 
ditch, he had pissed himself in fear while the P47 "Jabos" worked over 
his unit's convoy with bombs and machineguns, again and again until the 
stench of roasting flesh made him puke his last three breakfasts. He was
still hiding there two days later when an advancing American infantry 
unit scooped him up. Helmut was too demoralized to resist. Even now he 
dreamed every night of the smell of roasting flesh. He could still smell
it. Sometimes he dreamed the flesh was his. On those nights he woke up 
screaming to find his mattress soaked with sweat and urine. His 
continual shame made him an even bigger Nazi in the POW barracks than he
had been in the Hitler Youth.</p>

<p>As for sabotage, Helmut had been 
sorely disappointed. He was too closely watched during his service at 
the Depot to as much as spit in the "Amis'" coffee. His best opportunity
had been today. "25 Grenades, Hand, TNT Frag, MK.2 with fuze" read the 
crates that Helmut had helped position in the car. "Grenade" meant 
pretty much the same thing in several languages and Helmut understood 
exactly what was in those crates, but every time he looked up there was 
that verdammt American supervisor staring back at him, looking for all 
the world like a hawk about to sink its talons into a field mouse if it 
so much as twitched.</p>

<p>When Boatwright had collapsed and the rest 
of the crew was distracted, Helmut seized the chance to do the only 
thing he could think of to wreck the American war effort: he switched 
bills with another railcar that the crew had earlier loaded with 
clothing. If he could not destroy the cargo, he could at least send it 
where it was not needed. He was exultant. He had struck a blow for 
Fuhrer and Fatherland. He had in some small measure begun to atone for 
puking and pissing in fear at the bottom of that French ditch.</p>

<p>Helmut
watched as the American assigned to document the loading matched the 
wrong bill of lading with railcar's number. As the crew went on to 
loading the next car, he began to hum the "Horst Wessel Song." His 
fellow POWs looked at him like he was crazy, which of course he was.</p>

<h4>February 2, 1945: The Camp</h4>

<p>It
was a Friday afternoon in the warmest February Bill Hackney could 
remember, but then Bill was a native of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, not 
Aliceville, Alabama. A lumberjack by profession and a family man, Bill 
had initially been spared the draft. As a lumberjack he plied a trade 
that was ruled to be essential to the war effort, for everything that 
the "arsenal of democracy" turned out was shipped in wooden crates, 
lashed to wooden pallets, loaded onto wooden box cars, transported to 
wooden warehouses, and handled by men who slept in wooden barracks.</p>

<p>But
in July, 1944, Bill's wife told him she had fallen in love with a 
discharged soldier, a local fellow who had come home minus his right leg
below the knee after an encounter with a Jap knee mortar on New Guinea.
She wanted a divorce. It was crazy, but Bill figured maybe he could 
save his marriage by becoming a soldier himself. If she wanted a 
soldier, then a soldier he would become. He went down to the recruiting 
office and signed the papers. She laughed when he told her. Fortunately 
the kids were upstairs sleeping. He slapped her face so hard it spun her
around and dumped her on her butt on the kitchen floor. She wasn't 
laughing when he walked out the door. But then, he wasn't either. It was
the first time he'd ever touched her in anger, and though she'd 
deserved it, he wasn't proud of it.</p>

<p>Well, at least boot camp kept
him so busy he barely had time for the memory to rankle during the day.
The long nights were different, though. He had plenty of lonely, ugly 
thoughts then. With all the war news of casualties, casualties and more 
casualties, Bill figured he'd end up in a mattress cover six feet deep 
somewhere in France or maybe on some Central Pacific hellhole. So he was
surprised when God smiled on him and he drew an assignment to the 305th
Military Police Escort Guard Company stationed at the Aliceville POW 
Internment Camp.</p>

<p>Located close to the railroad junction in 
Aliceville, Alabama, the camp had been built by the Blair Construction 
Company of Montgomery, Alabama and was opened for business on June 2, 
1943 when the first prisoners arrived by train at the end of a long 
journey that had begun at El Alamein. The camp consisted of more than 
400 buildings, employed more than 1200 military and civilian personnel 
and housed over 6000 German and Italian POWs.</p>

<p>Throughout 1943 and
1944, the original complement grew with new arrivals from Sicily, 
Italy, France and Holland. Prisoners were employed mostly as 
agricultural laborers at local farms, and there hadn't been an escape 
attempt since August, 1943, when a couple of Nazi fanatics had managed 
to get themselves shot trying to get through the wire. Why they didn't 
walk away from a work detail when they were already miles away from the 
camp was a mystery to guards and prisoners alike, but then as Sergeant 
Wilkie put it, "Well, ya gotta be pretty fricking stupid to be a Nazi 
anyways."</p>

<p>Most of the prisoners figured they were pretty 
fortunate to be sitting the war out in safety rather than fighting in 
some doomed last ditch 'kessel' on the Eastern Front. Of course even if 
they had escaped, where would they go? Mexico? That might be an option 
for somebody interned in say, Arizona. (There had been rumors of a 
successful escape from a camp in that state.) But Alabama? You would 
have to be wire happy to try. Not that there weren't soldaten who didn't
go nuts behind the wire. The camp hospital had its own mental ward, and
occasionally a suicide was found hanging by a knotted bed sheet from an
overhead pipe or rafter.</p>

<p>Hackney also had heard the rumors that 
every now and then some POW would make an unflattering comment about the
Fuhrer and end up as an "unexplained death." The American camp 
commander wasn't too fussy about autopsies in such cases and if the 
Nazis still held sway in some of the tar-paper barracks there wasn't 
much the 305th MPEG Company could do about it. Gerald Stabler, the mayor
of Aliceville and the town undertaker still got the business generated 
thereby, for which services the U.S. Army reimbursed him, if not very 
handsomely.</p>

<p>But if the POWs didn't talk much politics or religion
to the guards or each other, they were scrupulous about keeping to the 
rules when outside the wire on work details. It wasn't uncommon for the 
MP guard to take the two shotgun shells he was issued out of his weapon,
sit down with his back up against a tree and go to sleep with the 
twelve gauge across his legs. When the work was done, one of the Krauts 
would gently wake him, and back to the camp they would go.</p>

<p>For 
their part, the guards never mistreated the prisoners (unlike some 
camps) and some became fast friends with POWs, although it was against 
the rules. The townsfolk had lined the streets and gaped at the 
prisoners when they first marched from the railroad station in 1943. 
("As if we had horns and a tail," one prisoner had told Hackney.) But 
now, almost two years later, some of them would invite POWs into their 
kitchens on a hot day and give them lemonade. Both MPs and POWs agreed 
there were worse places than Aliceville, Alabama to serve out the war.</p>

<p>But
at the moment, Private First Class William J. Hackney had a problem. In
fact, he had a big problem. The problem was a railroad car that should 
have been loaded with the winter clothing issue for 6000 men. But when 
Hackney had broken the door seal on the car and the POWs had pulled open
the door, instead of courdoroy pants and cotton shirts with "PW" strips
sewn on them there were crates of ammunition. Instead of standard issue
PW overcoats there were hand grenades. Hand grenades! Plus Lord alone 
knows what behind that! Hackney had followed orders and brought a work 
detail to the siding to unload what was supposed to be a bunch of 
clothes. Now he had twenty German soldiers hanging around looking at 
crates of munitions that they quite certainly recalled how to use.</p>

<p>The
first thing Bill did was to load his shotgun with his two puny little 
shells. They hardly seemed adequate for the occasion. Two shells divided
by twenty Krauts: nope, Mrs. Hackney's oldest son didn't like the math 
at all. Bill didn't see any of the more notorious camp Nazis in this 
bunch, but then, how do you tell a Nazi just by looking at him? He 
ordered the crew boss, Gunter Muller, to shut the door and move his work
party away from the car a good twenty yards or so. He then told Gunter 
to send a man to summon Sergeant Wilkie. Gunter's command of English was
excellent and he complied with the commands instantly, barking out 
Hackney's instructions in rapid-fire German. A "kreigie" went running 
down the siding to the supply office. Hackney moved in between the car 
and the Krauts. Gunter sensed how scared the Private was and ordered his
men to sit down facing away from the siding.</p>

<p>"With your 
permission, Sir, I have instructed ze men to sit down," said Gunter, 
maintaining his distance from both the rail car and the shotgun.</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah... Great, Gunter... Uh, and, thanks," stammered Hackney.</p>

<p>Gunter nodded, once, and stood very still.</p>

<p>Like
cavalry riding to the rescue, Sergeant First Class Walter "Wendell" 
Wilkie came barrelling down the track. "Hackney, what the hell is this 
Kraut all upset about?" demanded Wilkie, hooking his thumb back over his
shoulder at the POW runner who followed him at a respectable distance.</p>

<p>"Uh,
Sarge, we got us a SNAFU with this car. It don't have our cargo in it, 
it's got somebody else's," replied the Private First Class.</p>

<p>"All right, well get a couple of those Krauts to open her up so I can take a look," ordered the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Sarge,
I don't think that's a good idea," replied Hackney. He leaned toward 
Wilkie and whispered, "There's ammo and grenades in that car and God 
knows what else. It's packed to the gills!"</p>

<p>Sergeant Wilkie eyed Hackney suspiciously. "No shit?"</p>

<p>Hackney
nodded vigorously. "No shit, Sarge. That's why I had 'em move away from
it." He added, "I think we oughta get that damned thing outta here 
pretty damned quick."</p>

<p>"Private, that sounds like a damn fine 
idea," agreed Wilkie. Unbuttoning the flap on his holster and touching 
the butt of his .45 in reassurance, the Sergeant eyed Muller and his 
crew. "OK, here's how we'll do it. You escort Gunter and the rest of 
them Krauts up to the headquarters building and pick up Corporal 
Zelenski on the way. Don't let these guys outta your sight or let 'em 
talk to anybody. You make sure Gunter keeps these mothers quiet. Tell 
Zelenski I said to keep these Krauts under guard and away from the rest 
of the camp until we get this car outta here. Tell him to get as many 
men as he needs from the interior guard to make that happen. When he's 
got all the help he needs, tell him to send four more MPs with you back 
here, and tell 'em to come with full magazines. And top off your shotgun
too. You got that?"</p>

<p>Private First Class William J. Hackney nodded, "Yes, Sarge."</p>

<p>"Repeat it back to me," demanded the Sergeant.</p>

<p>Hackney
did. As the Sergeant expected, Pfc. Hackney got the first part right, 
and most of the second part wrong. Wilkie repeated his instructions, and
this time when the Pfc. repeated it, Hackney got it right.</p>

<p>"OK, then," Wilkie ordered, "Get Gunter with the program and move 'em off quick march. And come back here double time."</p>

<p>"Right, Sarge," said Hackney, adding, "I'll be back with help as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"You
damn well better," snapped the Sergeant, "or I'll have you on permanent
tower guard for the rest of the war. You'll have to eat, sleep and shit
up there."</p>

<p>Hackney's head bobbed up and down in agreement. All 
the guards hated tower duty. He turned and issued his orders to Gunter, 
repeating the instruction for absolute silence. Of course Gunter had 
heard the Sergeant's orders himself and, unlike Pfc. Hackney, he had 
understood them correctly the first time. Gunter saluted, American 
style, did an about face and strode down the embankment to his crew who 
had remained seated with their backs to the railcar. Executing another 
about face, Gunter commanded them to rise and fall in. The POWs leaped 
to their feet, quickly sorting out a line.</p>

<p>Keeping a straight 
face, Gunter addressed them in German in a conversational tone: "OK, 
kameraden, these 'Ami' arschlocks are crapping bricks about what's in 
that 'wagen'. They want us to follow that frightened private 'quick 
march' to the headquarters building and to say nothing to anyone along 
the way. Follow me."</p>

<p>With their backs to the Americans, the 
Germans grinned. There were no Nazis in this work party, just German 
soldiers trying to make it home. None of them wanted to be a dead hero. 
But the nervousness of the Americans reminded them that they were still 
'Deustche soldaten' and feared by their enemies. So they smiled as they 
faced right and marched in perfect step to the headquarters building, 
looking every bit the German soldiers they once had been and, in truth, 
still were.</p>

<h4>February 5, 1945: The Boxcar &amp; the Preacher's Son</h4>

<p>By
Friday evening the crisis was over. A switch engine had been summoned 
from the small Aliceville yard and the boxcar had been moved away from 
the camp and re-secured with an Ordnance Department padlock. After it 
left the camp area, Gunter and his men were released to go back to their
barracks. The unrepentant Nazis who secretly controlled the inner camp 
raged that such an opportunity for "making our own Second Front" had 
been lost. The rest of the POWs, including Gunter, thought them mad as 
hatters but said nothing. Despite their disappointment at being denied 
the opportunity for posthumous Knight's Crosses, the Nazis praised 
Gunter for the way he had maintained the German military spirit in the 
face of the cowardly, frightened Americans. They reluctantly agreed that
there had been little else Gunter could have done in the face of 
Sergeant Wilkie's vigilance.</p>

<p>As far as the American army was 
concerned, the only thing left was the paperwork. Something had to be 
done about getting the boxcar back on the way to its correct 
destination. And someone had to find out "where in the pluperfect Hades"
(to quote Captain Arliss who was a religious man and not disposed to 
profanity) the correct rail car full of the camp's winter clothing issue
was. On Monday morning, both of these jobs fell to First Sergeant 
Matthew Mark Luke, the NCO in charge of the 305th's quartermaster and 
transportation office.</p>

<p>Now as one might suspect from his name, 
Matthew Mark Luke was the first-born son of a preacher. And like many a 
preacher's son, Matt Luke was a rebellious young man when he was growing
up. In fact, that was how he had come to be in the army. It had been a 
cold night in November, 1937, when the Winston County, Alabama, probate 
judge caught young Matt deflowering his fair daughter in the carriage 
house. (Well, in fact the young lady who was not yet of legal age had 
been deflowered previously more than once by others, but that was a fact
that was both unknown to the judge at the time and immaterial in the 
heat of his rage.)</p>

<p>Matt Luke's life was saved that night by four 
happy accidents. First, the judge had snatched up his pistol instead of 
his shotgun when he had gone in search of his daughter. Second, the 
sight of his young daughter screaming and leaping about "in flagrante 
delicto" (as the legal community calls it) and "buck nekkid" (as they 
say in Winston County) disconcerted the judge greatly and spoiled his 
aim. Third, the Lord had placed a window right above the equally nekkid 
Matthew M. Luke, thus facilitating his rapid egress from the scene. And 
last, but certainly not least, the judge was drunker than Cooter Brown 
and couldn't have hit the broadside of the carriage house if his life 
depended on it.</p>

<p>The only thing the judge DID manage to hit in his
fusillade was a coal oil lamp that promptly exploded all over the 
upholstery of the judge's Model A Ford, which began to burn like the 
Devil himself had just returned it after taking it for a spin around the
Lake of Fire. Thus in one night did the judge lose his Model A, his 
carriage house and his illusions about his daughter's virtue. It is hard
to say which loss hurt him worse, but the neighbors who knew him best 
thought he mourned most over the Model A.</p>

<p>As for Matthew, he 
paused only long enough after his unclothed run home through the 
backwoods of Winston County to do four things. He put tincture of iodine
on his scratches (and some places hurt more than others). He jumped 
into a shirt, britches and shoes. He kissed his Momma goodbye. And he 
told her he was off to join the Army.</p>

<p>Army life suited Matthew 
Mark Luke. His sergeants were easier on him than his daddy had been. 
He'd been snapping to attention and saying "yessir" and "nossir" since 
he was two, which impressed the officers. Being a Winston County boy he 
could shoot straighter than most of his fellow soldiers, who were 
primarily sickly, cross-eyed city folk who'd never handled a rifle in 
their lives. Such martial competence always endears a young recruit to 
his drill sergeants. Better than that, he got to drink when off-duty and
nobody yelled at him. He also got to debauch himself with willing young
women and no one tried to shoot him. And lastly, and perhaps most 
importantly, he had a winning smile and wholesome good looks that 
allowed him to locate and acquire items for his fellow soldiers that 
they otherwise could not obtain. Matthew Mark Luke found a home in Army.</p>

<p>An
army, especially an army in peacetime in a country in the middle of a 
depression, is a place defined by its scarcities. Private Matthew Mark 
Luke quickly came to understand that the supply clerk gets first dibs on
anything that comes into the unit officially. He also understood 
intuitively that unofficially a supply clerk, especially a quick-witted 
supply clerk with a preacher-son's nose for human frailties, can corrupt
even the most straight laced officer or NCO if he can lay his hands on 
that man's vice of choice. In view of future events, it probably would 
have been better for the good order and discipline of the Army if 
Matthew Mark Luke's recruiting sergeant had met the Winston County 
probate judge before he signed the young man up. Unfortunately, future 
First Sergeant Matthew M. Luke did not introduce them. As a result, 
Parson Luke's son got the best of the bargain.</p>

<p>By the time of 
Pearl Harbor four years later, Matt Luke had made Staff Sergeant in the 
Regular Army, a meteoric ascent in peacetime. He had accomplished this 
by bribing his officers and blackmailing his NCOs. He also ran the post 
betting pool and provided moonshine to the enlisted men (though he was 
so slick that the Provosts could never catch him). Considering that 
Prohibition had ended years before, this was no mean feat. He did it by 
undercutting everyone else's prices and going directly to the distiller--
who just happened to be his Uncle Curtis who lived up near Natural 
Bridge. Curtis Stampp (his Momma's brother) had been a moonshiner all 
his life, as had his daddy and his daddy's daddy before him. It was said
that the Stampps had planted more terminally surprised "revenooers" in 
North Alabama than any other family. The Stampp family product was 
quality 'shine that never made anybody blind or killed 'em with just a 
drink or two, and that was about the most you could expect from any 
white lightning. It also made Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke a comparatively
rich man.</p>

<p>Now like any other important and influential man, 
Uncle Curtis Stampp had friends. Rich friends. Important friends. 
Crooked friends. Some of these friends controlled the Alabama Democratic
Party, which at the time was the only real party in Alabama, except in 
Winston County on account of the Civil War, but that's another story and
besides the Stampps had Winston sewed up anyway. Some of those friends 
also controlled the gambling and bawdy houses that flourished outside 
army posts all over the state, heck, all over the SOUTH. One of these 
towns was Phenix City, just across the river from Fort Benning, Georgia.
Later on, after the war, some of Curtis Stampp's friends had the 
Attorney General-elect of the state of Alabama assassinated because it 
looked like he was serious about cleaning up Phenix City. They didn't 
really have a name for their group back during the war, but Curtis 
Stampps and his friends later on came to be called the "Dixie Mafia." 
Some of their criminal descendants still call many of the shots in 
Alabama to this day.</p>

<p>After Pearl Harbor, Sergeant Luke realized 
that he was in on the ground floor of a big opportunity. The Army, his 
Army, was fixing to be a LOT bigger. More soldiers meant more vice and 
more money in his pocket. But there was a catch. While Matthew Mark Luke
was patriotic enough to wish the Japs and the Krauts were all blown to 
hell, he wasn't about to risk his own hide to do it. So a considerable 
amount of his time was taken up with using his influence (and that of 
his uncle) to make sure he never left the continental United States. By 
February, 1945, he had been transferred, and transferred again, each 
time promoted to greater responsibility, always in supply. His latest 
assignment had been of his own choosing, and promised to outlast the 
war. It was convenient in that it was located in his Uncle's "Area of 
Operations" as they say in the Army. He may have been in the Army, but 
Matthew Mark Luke was doubly home.</p>

<p>Being the senior supply NCO at
Aliceville offered many opportunities for an unscrupulous entrepreneur.
The prisoners all had nothing but time to burn, and the Germans 
especially were skilled with their hands. They could take a tin can and 
make a beautiful ashtray out of it. There were woodcarvers galore, and 
their work (intricately carved gnomes and walking canes were the most 
popular) brought good money from civilians outside the wire. In return 
for the POWs' art works, First Sergeant Luke traded them cigarettes, 
candy, liquor and on, occasion, women. By February, 1945, he was rolling
in dough.</p>

<p>But like most self-made rich men, Matt Luke never had 
enough money and he was always looking for new opportunities. And, like 
most successful thieves, he had grown a bit careless. But the boxcar 
presented a golden opportunity, if he could just figure out how to pull 
it off. It had dropped into his lap like a ripe peach, and he wasn't 
going to let it get away if he could help it.</p>

<p>First, he had to 
get a look at the goods. On the pretense of making sure that "nothing 
was missing." First Sergeant Luke took a stroll over to the railroad 
depot and unlocked the door. Luke slid open the boxcar's door and 
climbed up to the top of the stacked freight. Yup, there were grenades 
all, right, and lots of cases marked "Ammunition, Ball, .45 Caliber." 
Crawling over top of the crates, working his way along the space between
the roof of the car and the freight, First Sergeant Luke played his 
flashlight on the stenciling. "Gee-zus H. Chraaast," Luke whispered his 
daddy's Lord's name in vain. There were cases of .45 caliber grease guns
here to go with the ammo. He'd seen enough. Uncle Curtis would know 
where to move this merchandise.</p>

<p>Turning himself around in the 
cramped space, Matthew Mark Luke banged his head on one of the smaller 
crates on top. He cursed, then shined his GI flashlight on the markings.
"Ping pong balls?!?" Hey, he could use those! Luke made his way back to
the door opening and shoved the case of ping pong balls over the edge 
and out the door. The crate tumbled, bouncing twice, and landed about 
ten feet away from the tracks, upside down. Scampering down the stacked 
freight, the Master Sergeant jumped out of the car, slid the door back 
shut and replaced the padlock. Slinging the small crate over his 
shoulder, First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke headed back to town, 
immensely pleased with himself.</p>

<p>Seventy five yards away, hidden 
in the shade of the rail yard office roof, two men watched Luke carry 
away the case, although at that distance it was impossible to tell what 
the contents of the box were.</p>

<p>"You were right to call me, Mr. Peevey," said the taller of the two,</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Peevey, "I knowed that sumbitch was up ter no good."</p>

<p>"Don't
mention a word of this to anyone. Go home and make some notes about 
what just happened in case you're asked to testify about it later. Be 
sure to note the day and time."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Peevey. "I sure will, Captain."</p>

<p>First
Sergeant Luke turned right after he left the rail yard, easing on down 
the alley behind Aliceville's main street, trying to be as inconspicuous
as possible with his burden. Finally he came to the back door of the 
"rooming house" that everyone in town over the age of 10 knew was a 
discreet bordello and that almost no one knew was owned by one First 
Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke.</p>

<p>Dumping the ping pong balls on the 
floor just inside the door, Matt Luke entered the "boarding house" 
kitchen and made his way to the front room where the telephone was. 
There was no one about at this time of the morning. The "boarders" were 
all still sleeping upstairs, resting from their nightly exertions.</p>

<p>Twenty-five
minutes and three phone calls later, First Sergeant Luke left the 
"boarding house" by the same door he had entered and made his way back 
to the camp. With Uncle Curtis' assistance, he was about to steal a 
boxcar of United States government property. All he had to do now was to
arrange with the proper office at the camp to generate the documents 
and make the official phone calls necessary to send the boxcar on its 
way. And since that office was run by one First Sergeant Matthew Mark 
Luke, he didn't think that would be a problem. Smiling like the cat that
ate the canary, the preacher's son began to hum "In the Mood."...</p>

<p>Exactly
one week later, First Sergeant Luke's empire came crashing down upon 
his head. The crate that broke the camel's back was filled with ping 
pong balls.</p>

<p>Captain Harrison Fordyce, Provost of the Aliceville 
Camp, appeared suddenly one morning in the supply office, flanked by no 
less than four MPs. Fordyce had been investigating Luke's 
extracurricular activities for six months and prior to entering the 
office it had already been a busy morning. MPs under Fordyce's command 
had already raided Luke's whorehouse as well as a separate gambling 
establishment. Local police had not been contacted about the impending 
raids because Fordyce knew that most of them were on Luke's payroll. 
Indeed, one of Aliceville's finest had been found snoring next to the 
bawdyhouse madam. A state police captain was brought in from Montgomery 
to give the raids in town legal cover, but the operation was entirely 
Fordyce's.</p>

<p>Luke had known from the week of Fordyce's arrival at 
Aliceville Camp that he might become a problem. His sources told him 
that Fordyce was a bit of religious prig, and that the Captain neither 
smoked nor drank, did not apparently chase women and had no sense of 
humor whatsoever. Luke had approached the Captain from a number of 
angles offering various temptations but Fordyce had always ignored the 
hints or turned him down flat. In fact, Fordyce had been sent to 
Aliceville by the Army's Criminal Investigative Division specifically to
investigate complaints against First Sergeant Luke. This day 
represented merely another victory in the Captain's lifelong crusade to 
rid the Army of vermin like the Winston County preacher's son.</p>

<p>But
the threat of Fordyce was never enough to cause First Sergeant Luke to 
alter his operations. He was making too much money, having too much fun,
and had grown both cocky and sloppy. Stealing the ping pong balls had 
been the ultimate stupidity. He had wanted them for a third enterprise 
he planned for Aliceville, a "recreation center" for soldiers with 
perfectly legal billiard and ping pong tables on the first floor and 
highly illegal (and profitable) slot machines on the second. He 
certainly could have purchased a million ping pong balls with just one 
day's proceeds of his gambling and prostitution enterprises. But they 
were there, and he felt untouchable, and so he stole them because he 
could. Now that crate sat in Captain Fordyce's office, evidence of 
Luke's theft of government property. It was turning out to be a bad 
morning for First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke. He was unceremoniously 
slapped in the camp brig, and the official grilling of his subordinates 
in the supply office began.</p>

<p>By the next day, Captain Fordyce was 
ready to question the First Sergeant about his nefarious activities. He 
had left Luke stewing in the brig all the previous day to improve the 
disgraced NCO's willingness to cooperate. Fordyce had found this 
technique brought results in previous investigations. And he had many 
questions for Luke.</p>

<p>For example, this business of the ping pong 
balls was complicated by the fact that all documentation about the rail 
car-- its arrival at the camp, Sergeant Wilkie's report, even the 
incorrect bill of lading-- was missing from the files. The crate still 
bore US Army markings it was true, but unless the ping pong balls could 
be proven to have been government property by some documentary trail, 
the theft charge was in trouble. Fordyce was just about to have Luke 
brought over for interrogation when two pieces of news reached him 
almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>First, the boxcar was missing from the 
Aliceville rail yard, and Station Master Peevey had no idea where it had
gone. Second, First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke would not be available 
for interrogation that morning as his body had been found swinging from a
bed-sheet in the brig.</p>

<p>Captain Fordyce could not have known that
the First Sergeant was a claustrophobe. Ever since his daddy had locked
him in a closet for punishment when he was a boy, the preacher's son 
had a positive horror of enclosed spaces. After reading his report, the 
Captain's superiors did not fault him for the outcome of the 
investigation. The court martial of the First Sergeant, even given 
wartime security rules, would have been messy and embarrassing to the 
Army as well as the town of Aliceville. Far better that Luke had solved 
their problem in the way he had chosen.</p>

<p>With Luke's death, the 
problem just vanished. His little empire disappeared instantly and 
without a trace. No charges were filed. The prostitutes, gamblers and 
lesser bootleggers left town, and the clientele they had serviced now 
had to go further afield for diversion.</p>

<p>The mortal remains of 
First Sergeant Matthew Mark Luke were transported by rail to the Natural
Bridge station on the Southern Railway in Winston County, where the 
coffin was collected by his family. Two days later, his daddy gave a 
eulogy for the prodigal son. And if there was regret and remorse for the
way he had lived his life, the grief and the tears at his graveside 
were no less real. In time, the U.S. Army provided an official headstone
for the career soldier.</p>

<p>Less than ten miles away as the crow 
flies, another monument to the life and times of the wayward preacher's 
son sat on a deserted siding of an equally deserted old coal mine. His 
last and biggest scam had been successful.</p>

<p>Not that it would do Matthew Mark Luke any good where he had gone.</p>

<h4>February 28: The Deacon's Grandson</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The
Revolutionary War in the southern states has received little attention 
in comparison to the detailed study given the campaigns in the North. 
This is unfortunate since much decisive action took place there, but 
perhaps the nature of the struggle accounts for the historians' neglect.
 The heroes of the southern fighting were not the officers of the 
Continental army but rather the natural leaders of the people, who had 
learned their skills in the continuing effort to seize the land of the 
Indians.</p>

<p>By
achieving better perspective of the past, something may be accomplished
in the present. For the hero of this book has fallen on evil times. 
He is called various unflattering names today and is the butt of 
comic-strip buffoonery and the 'villain' of serious novels. Because he 
remains an individualist, he is a safe target.</p>

<p>There's
nothing new in this attitude, of course. In the Revolutionary War 
period, he was sneered at by the rich merchants of the lowlands, he was 
held in contempt by the Continental army's high command, and he was 
considered less than human by the British. Major Patrick Ferguson 
called him a bandit, a barbarian, a mongrel. He had little respect for 
law and order. He could be quite ruthless. He was also superstitious 
and at times na&iuml;ve. Yet Theodore Roosevelt could write of him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fathers followed Boone or fought at King's Mountain; the sons marched south with Jackson to overcome the Creeks; the grandsons died at the Alamo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And,
it should be added, the great-grandsons provided Lee and Johnson with 
the best fighting infantry the world had yet seen. Poorly clothed, 
half-starved, they responded magnificently to magnificent leadership and
almost won America's second civil war as their forefathers had won the 
first.</p>

<p>Moreover,
in wars since, they have always been the cutting edge. As F.N. Boney, 
the Georgia historian, puts it: 'There is no shortage of rednecks in 
the neat, quiet American military cemeteries which now dot the globe. 
However rejected in normal times, the redneck has always been welcomed 
when the nation went to war.'</p>

<p>Peace
is the dream today, and the redneck shares that dream. For him it was 
often a "rich man's war and a poor man's fight." He never started a 
war, but he was always ready when his home and personal liberty were 
threatened. And because of the readiness to do his duty, this nation 
was founded and kept alive...</p>

<p>Given
proper leadership, the mountain man can still be motivated. But in 
recent years such leadership has been largely lacking. The potential 
remains untapped, but it is there. As my father used to say in Happy 
Valley-- you may turn the damper up, you may turn the damper down, but 
the smoke goes up the chimney just the same.</p>

<p>It
was Will Shipman's 51st birthday, not that he felt like celebrating. 
The weather was cold, the coffee was cold, he had a cold and his wife 
had been acting cold as a brass monkey all week. Will knew why Mary was
mad at him, but there was little he could do about it. Sometimes 
you're just stuck with the duty, whether you want it or not. Mary didn't
understand that. Well, maybe she understood it, but that didn't mean 
she had to like it and she had never been shy about saying what she 
thought. Heck, that was one of the reasons Will had married her in the 
first place. Although, Will reflected, it had been a lot more endearing
when they had been in their twenties than it was now in their fifties.</p>

<p>"Sometimes
you're just stuck with the duty." His old shooting buddy Phil Gordon 
had told him that late one night on one of the rare times they'd spoken 
about Vietnam. William Sheats Shipman had been too young to participate
in the "Southeast Asia War Games," and one night while sitting at the 
campfire after an unsuccesful day on the deer stands, Will asked the 
older man what it had been like. Uncharacteristically, Phil Gordon told
him. Probably because he considered Will like a younger brother, 
Shipman thought.</p>

<p>The Shipmans and the Gordons had been kin-close 
for generations, almost 200 hundred years now, Will realized with a 
start. Both families traced their ancestry back to two men who had 
marched with Andy Jackson in the Creek War. Together they had helped 
avenge the Fort Mims massacre, and at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend they 
had broken the power of the Red Stick Creeks forever. Hezekiah Shipman 
and John MacKenzie Gordon had served under Colonel Coffee and his 
sergeant of scouts, the legendary David Crockett of Tennessee. One 
thing about following Davy Crockett around - each had learned to count 
on the other man's skills and they had saved each others' life so many 
times they had lost count.</p>

<p>After the fighting ended, they each 
took the 160 acres of free land that the cash-poor government had 
offered the veterans in lieu of pay, and had tramped over north Alabama 
looking for parcels they liked. Finally they made their hatchet marks 
on trees bounding 320 acres in what became Winston County, Alabama.</p>

<p>Being
Indian fighters, and with the memory of the burned stockade at Fort 
Mims fresh in their nostrils, they picked defensible high ground above 
some of the richest bottom land in the area (not that there was much of 
that), building cabins hard by each other, each straddling the property 
line within rifle shot.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that a Gordon daughter 
would marry a Shipman son, formalizing kinship ties that had first been 
forged in battle. Succeeding generations of Gordon and Shipman sons 
went off to the wars of their country (and, once, the war came to them).
 The lucky ones came back. But even if they didn't, there were always 
sons left to shoulder the rifles the next time their country called.</p>

<p>Will
had joined up too, in his time, and as an up-and-coming NCO, helped 
rebuild the Army after the disaster of Vietnam. He enjoyed making a 
difference. You could just FEEL the Army regain its bearings and its 
honor, especially after Ronald Reagan became President. Will decided 
that he would be a "lifer."</p>

<p>But God had different ideas.</p>

<p>There
were a lot of screw-ups during the Grenada operation that were never 
really publicized. Will Shipman got caught in one of them. By the time
he left Walter Reed, he was rated unfit for further service and let go 
with an honorable discharge and "the thanks of a grateful nation." He 
never talked about it, even with family. Mary knew, of course, and Phil
Gordon, but that was it.</p>

<p>Once, for his birthday, Mary had framed
his Purple Heart. It was beautiful to everyone except Will Shipman, 
who was reminded once again of the shipwreck of his hopes. He put it in
his desk drawer, and never hung it on his den wall as Mary had 
intended, an act that he knew hurt her feelings.</p>

<p>He had made a 
good life, though, after the Army and Mary was happy for the change. 
She had followed him dutifully from one dilapidated post to another 
during his short career. She'd paid her dues and Will knew that without
a doubt, Mary was happier now than she had ever been, with the kids 
married off and grandkids popping up every year or so. Which was why, 
Will knew, that she was so upset about what must come next.</p>

<p>Lord,
Will spoke in silent prayer looking at gathering gloom of the winter 
sky, I sure wish I had Phil here to talk this over with. After the ATF 
had murdered Phil Gordon (and Will Shipman had no doubt it was murder, 
even if Phil had made it a poor trade for them) he had wanted to go to 
war again. He got ready and so did his friends, the ones he knew he 
could count on.</p>

<p>But the country -- shocked by the body count Phil
had left among his attackers, confused by the media lies that 
criminalized him and his poor family afterward, or (like Will) shocked 
into the sudden realization of how ill-prepared they were for a war that
they should have seen coming and reluctant to resume the shooting until
they WERE ready -- well, the country was holding its breath.</p>

<p>But everyone knew this phony peace could not last.</p>

<p>The
Governor had said so too. Invoking the old notion of the "doctrine of 
interposition," he had warned the Feds that there would be no more 
Sipsey Streets in his state. Several southern and western states' 
governors did the same. The Alabama Department of Public Safety was no 
longer cooperating with their federal counterparts. In retribution, 
federal matching funds for everything from highways to welfare was cut 
off.</p>

<p>Right now the Governor had half of the state police 
intelligence unit keeping track of the movements and probable intentions
of every federal policeman in Alabama. A state grand jury was sitting 
at that very moment, hearing evidence that the Attorney General -- the 
first African American to hold the job and a staunch defender of the 
Second Amendment -- was hoping would lead to a murder case against the 
ATF. All indications were that the Feds, for their part, intended to 
indict the Governor for failing to obey the new federal laws passed in 
the wake of Phil Gordon's personal Little Big Horn. There were even 
rumors that the Feds were trying to engineer a political coup d'etat in 
favor of the Lieutenant Governor who was a pro-administration Democrat 
toady.</p>

<p>Will thought it was like being in a bar room, faced off 
against a bunch of yay-hoos, waiting for the beer bottle to topple off 
the table and set the brawl off with a crash. You could see it tipping,
but you couldn't do a thing to stop it. But if the Governor meant to 
stand between Phil Gordon's murderers and the people of Alabama, Will 
Shipman would stand with him.</p>

<p>So even if Mary didn't like or 
understand it, Will Shipman was stuck with the duty. And if ever he 
felt like shirking it, Will just couldn't do it. The ghost of Phil 
Gordon, among others, wouldn't let him.</p>

<h4>1861-1865: Aunt Jenny and the Ghosts of Winston County</h4>

<p>Now
Will Shipman was a man of many parts, as some folks say. Depending 
upon how you reckoned it, he was a husband, a father and grandfather, a 
hard-worker, a devout church-going man, a Civil War reenactor, a 
registered voter, a disabled veteran, a former Republican and a man 
whose opinions were respected by most all who knew him. He had an 
easy-going manner and nothing much got him excited, although he was 
mighty upset and morally offended about how the country had been going 
lately, even before the Battle of Sipsey Street.</p>

<p>But he also was a
man with a secret and a duty. The duty was tied up with the secret and
vice versa, or "vicey versey" as they say in Winston County. Truth be 
told, Will Shipman WAS Winston County, and Winston County WAS Will 
Shipman. You couldn't understand the future of the one, without 
understanding the past of the other.</p>

<p>As I said, Will's family had
been in Winston County just about since God made dirt, settling over in
the western part of the county near Natural Bridge. The natural bridge
itself (that is the rock bridge, not the town named after it) was 
beautiful then and now despite all the bloody history that has gone on 
around it. It is the longest natural bridge east of the Mississippi, 
spanning some 148 feet. Over 60 feet high and 33 feet wide, you must 
walk beneath the bridge among the wild magnolias, snowball bushes, rare 
ferns, mountain laurel and Canadian hemlock trees in order to appreciate
the awesome beauty of its size. Indians sheltered under it long before
the Will Shipman's ancestors came, and it was Will's favorite place in 
the whole world. Sitting beside the ferns In the quiet of a warm 
afternoon, the glade seemed to be his own private Eden. He had courted 
Mary beneath the stone bridge, and he proposed to her atop its arch not 
long after he got back from Basic Training.</p>

<p>But if the natural 
bridge and Winston County were beautiful, and they were, it was a 
terrible beauty nonetheless. Only someone raised in Winston County knew
or cared about the particulars of the darker side of history in those 
parts. There was plenty of it. The Byler Road, the first state highway
in Alabama, ran right by Natural Bridge and connected the Tennessee and
Tombigbee river valleys. Completed in 1822, the road was only slightly
less infested with hijackers and highwaymen than its more notorious 
cousin, the Natchez Trace. An incautious man traveling the Byler Road 
could find himself at dusk on a lonely stretch and never be seen again.</p>

<p>Even
without the highwaymen, Winston was a harsh place to try to make a go 
of it. First of all, the county is "mostly up and down and very little 
sideways" as one pioneer put it. The topography of Winston County 
varies from rolling and hilly to rough and mountainous. God had covered
the county with huge, deep-green forests, consisting of oak, poplar, 
beech, chestnut, sorghum, holly and shortleaf pine. Yet the soil was 
so poor that the yeomen farmers who settled there scratched out a bare 
subsistence at best. Even in places where the soil was sufficient for 
the growing of crops, the unpredictable weather, especially the rains, 
stunted the growth of cotton, the principal cash crop in the 19th 
century. Consequently, the production of corn made the most hard cash 
for the settlers, especially when turned into whiskey. Bootlegging is 
an ancient and honorable trade in Winston County: always has been, and 
likely always will be. Although, it must be admitted that by the first 
decade of the 21st Century, the modern criminal class in the mountain 
regions of the South had long since graduated to marijuana and crystal 
methamphetamine as far more lucrative cash crops.</p>

<p>But as tough as
life was for settlers in Winston County in peacetime, the Civil War 
seared the county and its people and forever changed them and defined 
them as proud and defiant survivors. Will knew all the stories. Many 
of his ancestors on both sides of his family had killed, and had been 
killed in turn fighting for the Union or simply for the right to live 
and be left alone.</p>

<p>Back before the turn of the 21st century, Will had picked up a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bushwhackers-Civil-War-North-Carolina/dp/0895870878/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213361725&amp;sr=1-1"><i>Bushwhackers</i></a>
about the war in the mountains of North Carolina. It was one of his 
favorites because the descriptions of what went on in the Tarheel state 
mirrored what had happened to his own people. William R. Trotter 
introduced his history with this passage, which Will Shipman recalled 
word for word, he had read it so many times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The
events that happened in the mountain counties... furnish a 
microcosmic view of the Civil War's effects. The fighting, the 
suffering, and the dying all took place on an individual scale, and 
there is a recognizably human profile to the drama. You can tell this 
much from the way the Civil War period remains alive in the generational
memories and oral traditions of the mountain region. This certainly 
includes, but goes far beyond, the still-vivid demarcations between 
Republican and Democratic voting patterns in certain counties. For 
mountain families whose roots go back far, the collective memories do 
not stop with the stories of those who fell at Gettysburg or suffered at
the hands of Sheman's invaders. When they speak of the Civil War, they
also speak of the dark night on a backwoods lane when great-great 
grandfather was cut down by bushwhackers, or of that raw frontier 
morning when great-great grandmother stood on the front porch of her 
cabin and watched a patrol of Thomas' Legion -- full-blooded Cherokee 
warriors hot with youth and heritage -- ride whooping through a patch of 
morning sunlight with fresh Unionist scalps dangling from their saddle 
horns.</p>

<p>It was a personal kind of war, up in the mountains. It 
produced its share of heroes and more than its share of bloody-handed 
villains. The fighting took place in a different dimension than the 
organized battles on the main fronts, where huge formations of uniformed
men fired massed volleys at other huge formations of distant, faceless,
uniformed men. In the mountains, there was little of that long-range 
impersonal killing. In the mountains, the target in your gunsight was 
not a figure a thousand yards away, positioned at the other end
of a smoke-obscured battlefield crowded with regiments. Indeed, he was
an individual human being with a clear and unique face, and he was, all
too many times, a man whose identity and home you had known since 
childhood. When you pulled the trigger on such a man, you did not leave
a heap of distant bones--one more swollen, powder-blackened piece of 
carrion among hundreds, heaped on the same acreage. You left a dead man
whose wife and children you probably knew by name...</p>

<p>The war 
in the mountains may not have been large, but it was vicious, and it 
took place on an all-too-human scale... It was this kind of war in 
the mountains: The killers had names, their victims had kin, and 
everybody owned a gun.
</blockquote></p>

<p>Now, going on a century and a half
later, neither the descendants of the killers nor the descendants of 
the victims had forgotten a thing. And heck, everybody in Winston 
County still owned a gun, Will thought with a chuckle, most of us own 
more than one. Some of us own a LOT more than one.</p>

<p>Will had been
raised on the stories of the "Free State of Winston." What was it 
somebody had said of the Irish? They had forgotten nothing of history 
and learned nothing from it, either... something like that. Well, Will 
Shipman hadn't forgotten where he and his kin came from, but whether he 
had learned something from history, well, that remained to be seen.</p>

<p>The
"Free State of Winston" got its name from the turmoil in the region at 
the opening of the War Between the States. The county, like several of 
the mountainous counties of northern Alabama had sent anti-secession 
delegates to the secession convention down in Montgomery and they had 
been as popular with the planters who ran the convention as a fart in 
church. A Winston County delegate, Christopher Sheats, had been thrown 
in the Montgomery County Jail because he refused to change his vote.</p>

<p>After
the Jefferson Davis declared the Confederacy on the steps of the 
Capitol Building in Montgomery, Chris Sheats was let out of jail. He 
returned to Winston County an older and wiser man, but no less 
determined to oppose secession. The mountain folk held a meeting after 
Chris Sheats' release and passed a resolution declaring that if the 
Confederacy left them alone, they would leave the Confederacy alone.</p>

<p>Dick
Payne, one of the few secessionists at the meeting, sneered "Ho, ho! 
Winston County secedes! The 'Free State of Winston.'"</p>

<p>Sneering 
aside, the people of the hills of north Alabama sincerely hoped that 
they could continue to live in peace, undisturbed by a war they wanted 
no part of. It was not to be. Two new laws of the Confederacy saw to 
that.</p>

<p>The first was the draft law. Conscription parties made up 
of the Home Guard and draft officers came up into the hills looking for 
recruits, willing or unwilling. After the first young men were 
shanghaied, the mountaineers either got of the way of the conscription 
parties or ambushed them. The fact that the planters exempted 
themselves from the draft made it easier for the mountain dwellers to 
resist. This was called the "20 nigger rule". If a planter could show 
ownership of 20 slaves, they were exempt from the draft. To men who had
been arguing that it was a rich man's war but a poor man's fight, this 
law merely proved their point.</p>

<p>The second, and worse ordinance as
far as the mountaineers saw it, was the tax-in-kind law. This law said
that every citizen of the Confederacy was obliged to pay taxes for the 
support of the army, and it they couldn't afford to pay money, they 
would have to pay "in kind", that is a portion of their livestock and 
crops. To the subsistence farmers of the hills, a visit from the Home 
Guard to take their hogs or milk cow could mean starvation for their 
family. Coming from a government that the hill folk refused to believe 
in the legitimacy of any way, this was mere thievery. It was too bad 
for the Home Guard, but stealing from poor folks with guns has always 
been a dangerous task. And the Winston County folks not only wouldn't 
be pushed around, but they had a highly refined sense of personal 
justice.</p>

<p>Will Shipman knew all the stories, but not until the book and movie <a nameless href="http://www.amazon.com/Cold-Mountain-Charles-Frazier/dp/0802142842/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213361958&amp;sr=1-1"><i>Cold Mountain</i></a>
had the Confederate Home Guards ever been portrayed to the larger 
nation as the thieving murderers that they were. Will liked that movie a
lot. His ancestors had killed more than few Home Guards and he was 
proud of it.</p>

<p>Will was also related to Aunt Jenny Brooks, and he 
was even prouder of that. The story of Aunt Jenny was just one of the 
legends to come out of the war in the mountains, but as Will Shipman 
well knew, it was true. He had seen the hickory stick.</p>

<p>Will had 
heard the story of Aunt Jenny Brooks told many times by many folks, but 
the first time anybody had put it to paper was back in the nineteen 
thirties when Carl Carmer related what old Tom Knox told him:</p>

<blockquote>
"When I knew her," said Tom, "she was a little dried-up ol' woman but she had
talkin' blue eyes. She run this county like she was queen of it. 
Nobody ever candidated round here without she said so. When they had 
the War Between the States a lot o' people in these parts felt like 
they... didn't want to fight for rich folks in the Black Belt so's they
could have niggers do their work for 'em free. Folks in this county 
was pretty well fixed then. They was makin' liquor the same as now, and
the lumber companies hadn't cut over the woods an' druv away the game 
an' spiled the land. So Henry Brooks, Aunt Jenny's husband, said he 
wasn't goin' to be a soldier, he was satisfied to stay right here an' 
mind his own business."</p>

<p>"Not long after that a party of 
Confederates came up into the hills to force men into their army. Henry
Brooks wouldn't run from 'em when they come to his house but he fought 
when they tried to take him away an' they shot him dead. Aunt Jenny's 
four boys was little shavers then but she got 'em all out o' bed an' 
made 'em swear on the dead body of their pa that they'd kill the men 
that shot him. Well, sir, in the next forty year they got ever' one of 
'em. They kep count with notches on a hickory stick. Aunt Jenny had 
three of 'em herself. One was for the leader. She cut his head off an'
cooked it till it was jest a skull an' made it into a soap dish. She 
used it ever' day, an' jest a minute before she died she washed her 
hands in it for the last time."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last shots of the 
extended feud that began with the murder of Henry Brooks were fired in 
McCurtain County, Oklahoma, in 1904. In the end, all of the men who 
participated in the killing of Aunt Jenny's husband were dead, along 
with a considerable number of their sons, brothers and friends. Aunt 
Jenny outlived 'em all. Jenny sure enough kept count, Will knew - he 
had seen that hickory stick. The skull soapdish had come up missing 
over the years. His Daddy had said it had apparently been buried by 
church-going niece of Jenny's who thought it looked satanic, 
half-grinning at her from the mantle piece over the fireplace.</p>

<p>After
the battle of Shiloh brought the Federal army into the Tennessee River 
Valley, the menfolk of Winston County and the other surrounding mountain
counties went down to enlist. The 1st Alabama Union Cavalry Regiment 
was mustered into service at Corinth, Mississippi in 1863 and served 
with distinction till the end of the war. Their fellow Alabamians 
called them traitors and tories and mossbacks and other names unfit to 
print.</p>

<p>The men of the Free State of Winston didn't care what they
were called as long as they were left alone. No one pushed them 
around. No one. As far as they were concerned, you messed with 
mountain folk at your own peril. If the Confederates had lost the war, 
and along with it most everything they owned or held dear, well, the 
mountaineers figured the planters had asked for it and they deserved 
what they got. Of course after Reconstruction ended and the planter 
class took back over, things went hard for Winston County. But things 
had always been hard up in the hills, and if the unionists regretted the
decision they had taken, they didn't tell their descendants about it.</p>

<p>But, oh, the stories they had left - some like Aunt Jenny's and some that were worse.</p>

<p>Will
Shipman shivered and gathered in the wool blanket tighter around him. 
Oughta throw another log or two on the fire. Gettin' too old for this 
re-enacting stuff. It had been all right when the sun was shining, the 
blue wool uniform helped maintain his body heat. But the sun was gone 
now, and the naked trees around the campsite flickered in and out of the
darkness like the ghosts that some said still haunted these parts.</p>

<p>There
was Mitch Kennedy, who was shot dead by the Home Guards and whose body 
was pretty well ate up by the hogs before his sickly wife could get help
to bury him. And poor Henry Tucker, on leave from the First Alabama 
Union Cavalry, who Stoke Roberts and the other Confederate Home Guards 
had staked to a tree, cutting off a piece of him at a time while a slow 
fire tickled his naked feet. Roberts had finished him by cutting out 
his liver and eating it, they said. They left him there, staked to that
tree. But Tucker's neighbors and kin had caught up with Roberts later 
and did the same things to him that he had done to Henry, stroke for 
stroke. They didn't eat him though, because they were Christians after 
all.</p>

<p>All the ghosts from the war, all the evil, Will Shipman 
thought. It was easy enough in the gathering gloom to believe they 
still stalked through these dancing trees in winter, looking for the 
justice in death that they had been denied in life. Will guessed that 
was why he had become a civil war re-enactor to begin with. It was his 
own way of letting the ghosts know that they were not forgotten. And 
some of those ghosts were family. He didn't need to play soldier like 
some other re-enactors in Company C seemed to. He'd been a real 
soldier, in a real war, even if it had been a little one. So long ago 
and far away it seemed now.</p>

<p>Yet he still had trouble with night 
skirmishes. He wouldn't do them, even now. The flashes and bangs in 
the night brought back too many personal demons, too much memory. That 
was one thing he had discovered. Sometimes, you can remember too much.</p>

<p>Corporal
Dan Cutter, who was an advertising account executive in Birmingham 
during the week, emerged from his A-frame tent wrapped in a federal 
pattern greatcoat, fiddle in his right hand and a bottle of Bushmill's 
Irish Whisky in his left. Bushmill's, the toast of the cavalry.</p>

<p>Cutter came over and sat down on the hardtack box next to his captain.</p>

<p>"Have a pull, Captain?" the fiddler asked, offering the bottle to Will.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Shipman said, unscrewing the cap and taking a sip. "Just don't tell my wife," Will added, handing back the bottle.</p>

<p>Cutter grinned, "I'm the soul of discretion, sir," and took a pull himself.</p>

<p>Replacing the cap, the corporal set down the bottle between them on the cold earth.</p>

<p>"Would ye like a tune, Captain?" said the fiddler in his best fake-Irish brogue.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Will, "Anything."</p>

<p>Cutter
put the fiddle to his chin and struck up "Bonaparte's Retreat." The 
mournful tune echoed in the dead woods and by ones and twos, other men 
and boys of Company C, 1st Alabama Union Cavalry Regiment gathered 
around the fire, listening.</p>

<p>Will Shipman ignored them, staring 
out into the trees, deep in thought about his wife, Phil Gordon, the 
country and his duty. Yep, he was stuck with the duty, that was sure. 
His daddy had stuck him with the duty, just like his grandpa had stuck 
his daddy with it. His daddy had been off to the war when the whole 
thing had happened. When he got back, Will guessed it had been five or 
six years before Grandpa Shipman had told his son about what was in the 
old mine. Both a burden and a legacy, the secret passed from generation
to generation and now it was his. And the times being what they were, 
it was getting close to the time when Will Shipman was going to have to 
open up that dark shaft and deal with his deadly inheritance.</p>

<p>"Bonaparte's Retreat" ended, and Tommy Curtis sat down with his dulcimer beside Cutter on a large piece of cut firewood. </p>

<p>"Star of the County Down?" Cutter asked.</p>

<p>Curtis
nodded, and they struck up the tune by Clinch River Pearl. The music 
was beautiful but, if anything, sadder than "Bonaparte's Retreat." 
Music fit for ghosts, Will thought. They probably approved the 
serenade, at that.</p>

<h4>1945: The Preacher, the Deacon and the Boxcar</h4>

<p>His
daddy had told him how the family came to have the responsibility. The
Preacher Luke hadn't known about his son's last caper until after the 
funeral. His no-account brother-in-law Curtis Stampp had sidled up to 
him at the cemetery after the service.</p>

<p>The bootlegger made his 
condolences and then asked the Preacher if Matthew Mark Luke had called 
him before his death. The question took the preacher by surprise, and 
the obvious interest of his wife's brother in the last days of his son 
instantly worried him.</p>

<p>"No," said the preacher. "Did you?" He fixed the bootlegger with his best right-hand-of-God look.</p>

<p>"Uh, naw," stammered the bootlegger. "I was jest wondering if'n you'd heard from him."</p>

<p>"No," said Parson Luke, still suspicious.</p>

<p>"Uh, well, I'm sure sorry about the boy. I know y'all didn't get along but I always liked him."</p>

<p>The
preacher just looked at the bootlegger, and tried to remember that he 
was commanded to love the sinner but hate the sin. With his 
brother-in-law, that was especially difficult.</p>

<p>It was two days 
later, when he'd heard from his wife and other family members that 
Stampp was asking around about Matt Luke and some sort of railroad 
boxcar, that the preacher began to suspect that his brother-in-law might
have had something to do with his son's death. But it was his 
experience with Captain Harrison Fordyce, United States Army, that made 
him certain of it.</p>

<p>Fordyce roared into the little town of Natural
Bridge like General Patton four days after the mortal remains Matthew 
Mark Luke were laid to rest. Accompanied by three MPs, with the Winston
County Sheriff and a state police captain in tow, Fordyce arrived at 
the little parsonage in a Dodge staff car with all the politeness of a 
Sherman tank. Fordyce was a fast-talking, nasal New England Yankee, 
with all that implies to a southerner. He was in a position of 
authority and was used to getting his own way. He was also in a lot of 
hot water with his superiors over the missing boxcar and the botched 
investigation. This did not improve his humor nor did it do anything 
for his manners. And manners are important in Winston County.</p>

<p>Without
polite preamble, the captain began to grill the preacher and his wife 
over their son's misdeeds, the missing boxcar, and their duty in time of
war to assist the government in retrieving property their son had 
stolen. Not knowing any of this, Mrs. Luke broke down into tears and 
was so distraught that even hardboiled Capt. Fordyce allowed her to flee
to her bedroom while he continued the interrogation of the parson.</p>

<p>Preacher
Luke was unhelpful to the CID captain. How could he be otherwise? His
son had hardly shared the fact that he was a gambler, bootlegger and 
whoremaster. Captain Fordyce thought differently, and wondered if a few
days in jail might jog the parson's memory. Not trusting the sheriff, 
Fordyce asked the state police captain to take the preacher under arrest
to Birmingham, where he was lodged for four long days and nights. 
Fordyce had learned something though. Before taking Preacher Luke into 
custody, he made sure that the minister did not suffer from 
claustrophobia.</p>

<p>The incarceration did not improve the preacher's 
memory, as indeed it could not, and it didn't improve his opinion of the
government, either. From the very first minute of Fordyce's Gestapo 
tactics, Preacher Luke had determined he would tell the overbearing 
captain nothing. In fact, he decided that if he ever did find out about
this mysterious boxcar, Fordyce was likely to be the last person he 
called.</p>

<p>Turned out of Birmingham Jail without an apology or a 
ride, the preacher made his own way back to Winston County, determined 
never to leave there until the Lord called him Home. But he was also 
determined to find out about the boxcar and what relationship it had 
with his son and his crooked brother-in-law.</p>

<p>The day Parson Luke 
was let out of jail in Birmingham, Deacon Warren Shipman was out hunting
when his coon dogs hit on the trail of a raccoon that cut across the 
old Sipsey Coal Company mine tipple on the far corner of the preacher's 
property. The Reverend Luke owned more than 240 acres that he had 
inherited on the death of his Uncle Jeremiah. Jeremiah had sold the 
mineral rights for a song back in the 1890s, and in the Twenties the 
West Sipsey Coal Company had sunk a number of shafts looking for the 
black rock to feed the growing steel industry in the Birmingham 
industrial district. The coal company had some success, but then ran 
into water and methane, the twin banes of the coal miner's existence.</p>

<p>In
1930, a gas explosion killed two men and the blast caused the lower 
levels of the mine to flood. Hammered by the depression in addition to 
the disaster, the company folded. The last thing it did was wall off 
the lower level, board up the mine entrance and post it with big warning
signs. Creditors came and hauled off the equipment and the abandoned 
mine buildings were dismantled over the next decade bit by bit to 
provide bricks and wood for other construction in the county. By 1945, 
the only things left to show there had been a mine there was the 
abandoned tipple and the railroad track spur which led in from the main 
line.</p>

<p>So it was that when Deacon Shipman came around the tipple, 
chasing his dogs who were chasing the 'coon, he came face to face with 
the boxcar sitting on the siding and stopped short. The deacon took a 
look at the lock on the door, saw the US markings and knew even before 
he looked that this was the boxcar the preacher had been thrown in jail 
over. Mrs. Luke had told him all about it. But the baying dogs were 
growing fainter in the distance, so Deacon Shipman grabbed up his 
shotgun and continued on the hunt. But he'd tell the preacher about 
this as soon as he saw him.</p>

<p>It took the preacher the better part 
of a day to get back to Winston County and his frantically worried wife.
 The next morning he rose to discover that there was little kindling 
left in the box so the Reverend Luke commenced to splitting some more 
out back. It was here that the Deacon Shipman found him and imparted 
the news about the mysterious boxcar.</p>

<p>"Warren, I want you to promise that you won't say a word to anybody about this," said the Reverend.</p>

<p>"Preacher, after what they put you through, I won't tell a soul. But what are you gonna do with it?" asked the deacon.</p>

<p>"I
don't know, Warren. Let's us go take a look in it." So they took a 
sledge and chisel from the preacher's barn to use on the lock and hiked 
back to the mine.</p>

<p>Deacon Warren Shipman remembered the moment 
they rolled back the door on that boxcar for the rest of his life. Not 
so much for the fact of what it contained, but for the words that 
blurted out of his preacher's mouth.</p>

<p>"Well I'll be dipped in 
shi..." Parson Luke caught himself at the last instant. He hadn't 
always been a preacher of the Holy Word, and the curse from his sinful 
youth had just popped out. The deacon stared at his pastor, shocked to 
the soles of his shoes.</p>

<p>Reverend Luke's face flushed a deep 
purple. "I'm sorry, Warren, I just..." His voice trailed off. So this 
was what his son had died for. After Fordyce's litany of Matt's alleged
sins down at Aliceville, the preacher had few illusions about what his 
son had been up to. Reverend Luke also knew that his low-life 
no-account brother-in-law was involved in this business up to his 
eyeballs. Well, his son had stolen this war material, that much was 
plain, and by rights it ought to go back to the government.</p>

<p>But 
the last representative of the United States government that the good 
reverend had encountered was that nasty Yankee, Captain Fordyce. What 
right did the captain have, terrorizing his wife like that? And by what
right had the CID man thrown him in jail on no evidence, for that 
matter? The minister still faced the next Sunday service, and the 
deacon board afterward, when he would have to explain to everyone the 
extent of his son's misdeeds and his own involvement. Would the 
congregation believe him when he told them he had nothing to do with it,
despite the fact that the Army had him arrested? He thought they 
would, but already the gossipy old biddies were making up stories about 
what they did not know.</p>

<p>To turn the boxcar back to Fordyce was 
like ratifying that the CID man had a right to do what he did. When the
captain had explained to him how his son had died, the Reverend Luke 
knew it was true. The boy always did have a terror of small spaces. 
And wasn't that his fault? But the guilt and the shame and the anger 
worked on him at cross purposes without decision. What should he do? 
If he didn't give the boxcar back to Fordyce, he'd be stealing too, 
wouldn't he? And there was never a thought of letting Curtis Stampp 
have the proceeds of his criminal conspiracy.</p>

<p>His son was dead 
and buried. The precious son he had held so proudly the day of his 
birth had gone. Somewhere he had gone astray, and now all the hopes and
dreams the preacher had for his son were gone, too. Gone and buried. 
Buried, the Reverend Luke thought. Yes, that's it, buried.</p>

<p>He 
turned to his head deacon and explained what he wanted to do with the 
contents of the boxcar. They had been friends since the age of twelve, 
grew up together, hunted and fished together, raised cain on Saturday 
nights together, found the Lord at the same camp meeting together, and 
settled down to their lives in Winston County together. Warren Shipman 
was probably more outraged than the preacher over what had been done to 
him and his wife by that stinking Yankee.</p>

<p>"Yup, Jim, I'll help 
you. But it's going to be a big job and I don't think we'd better bring
anybody else in on it. It'd better be just you an' me. We ought not 
tell our wives either." The preacher nodded. "We're gonna need some 
tools," the deacon went on. "A team of mules an' a flat bed freight 
wagon and a snatch block. There's enough timber around here to do the 
job, but it's gonna take a while. What bothers me is what are we gonna 
do with the boxcar once we get it unloaded? That shiftless sheriff is 
gonna come nosing around here one of these days and how are you gonna 
explain THAT?" Shipman pointed at the huge railroad car.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Warren," replied the reverend. "I'll think on it."</p>

<h4>February 28: The Duty</h4>

<p>"Star of the County Down" ended on its last, mournful notes. The deacon's grandson awoke from his reverie. He was still cold.</p>

<p>"Cutter, you're depressin' me with all that scratchin' fit for a funeral. Can't you do better than that?"</p>

<p>"What did ya have in mind, Captain?" asked the fiddler.</p>

<p>Shipman looked around at his comrades gathered round the fire.</p>

<p>Little Jimmy Flynn offered, "How 'bout 'Poor White Boys', Cap'n?"</p>

<p>The
men agreed, Shipman could see. It was the 1st Alabama Union Cavalry's 
unofficial marching song. It was also know as "The Perfect Penultimate 
Grayback Piss-off Song."</p>

<p>"Cutter," said the captain, "Do you know 'Poor White Boys'?"</p>

<p>"Captain, is the Governor a Baptist?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I reckon he is."</p>

<p>"Well,
all right then," said the fiddler and began to scratch out the tune of 
"Bonnie Blue Flag", that most sacred of Confederate battle songs, only 
the words the boys of the "Thirsty First" sang along with the music 
would have horrified the United Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>

<p><i>"We are a band of planters, unfaithful to our wives,<br/>
Fighting for our property, but frightened for our lives.<br/>
So when our rights are threatened, our cry goes near and far:<br/>
Send us a million poor white boys to fight our wicked war!<br/>
Hurrah! Hurrah! For planter's rights Hurrah!<br/>
Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man's war!"</i></p>

<p>The Bushmills' bottle came up again, making the rounds, sloshing into tin cups.</p>

<p><i>"Ye men of valor gather 'round, and help us in our plight.<br/>
Old Abe's freed the dark-skinned girls with whom we spend the night.<br/>
And just because ye have no slaves, we'll give you one or two,<br/>
As long as you help us in our fight against the Yankee crew.<br/>
Hurrah! Hurrah! For planter's rights Hurrah!<br/>
Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man's war!"</i></p>

<p>In between the verses, the cups were upended, burning throats, and the singing got louder if not more melodious.</p>

<p><i>"Of course we know that you won't fight for rich men's property,<br/>
You hardly have enough to eat to feed your family.<br/>
So 'state's rights' is the banner we choose to lead your ranks,<br/>
And now we won't repay our loans to all those Yankee banks!<br/>
Hurrah! Hurrah! We'll profit more, Hurrah!<br/>
Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man's war!"</i></p>

<p>As
the verse ended, Corporal Klingman, already half-lit from his private 
stock when the Bushmills began its journey and who was standing with his
left boot on a piece of firewood, stumbled when it rolled under him and
he almost fell into the fire. His friends roared with laughter, and 
resumed singing, but the beginning of the next verse was a little 
ragged.</p>

<p><i>"But when the long roll beckons and you all fall into line,<br/>
Of all the many faces there you surely won't see mine.<br/>
I've business to attend to, and I'm certainly no fool.<br/>
I'll stay right here and hide behind the 'Twenty Nigger Rule.'<br/>
Hurrah! Hurrah! For planter's rights Hurrah!<br/>
Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man's war!"</i></p>

<p>Their
voices echoed down the glen, through the naked trees. If there were 
indeed Unionist ghosts out there, they liked the tune.</p>

<p><i>"We've mountain loads of cotton that's already been picked,<br/>
Bought by the Confed'racy, unable to be shipped.<br/>
Jeff Davis says to burn it, but the Yanks'll buy we're told.<br/>
We'll compromise our principles, IF THEY PAY IN GOLD!<br/>
Hurrah! Hurrah! We'll profit more, Hurrah!<br/>
Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man's war!"</i></p>

<p>The
bottle came 'round to Shipman again, but the captain declined to take 
another drink, handing it off to First Sergeant Williams, who took a 
healthy slug, even by cavalry standards.</p>

<p><i>"And when the war is over, and our independence won,<br/>
We'll host a celebration for those left alive to come.<br/>
There'll be food and drink aplenty and our daughters there to charm,<br/>
Engaged to other planter's sons WHO NEVER LEFT THE FARM!<br/>
Hurrah! Hurrah! For planter's rights Hurrah!<br/>
Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man's war!"</i></p>

<p><i>"Hurrah! Hurrah! For planter's rights Hurrah!<br/>
Hurrah for the poor white boys who fight our rich man's war!"</i></p>

<p>The
re-enactors of the First Alabama cheered and hooted and huzzahed. This
was their song and they loved it. Their forefathers had despised the 
Confederacy and this was their way of letting everybody know that if it 
was good enough for their great- great- granddaddies then it was good 
enough for them.</p>

<p>Somebody yelled "Minstrel Boy!" and the fiddler struck up the tune with all of the by-now well-lubricated troopers joining in.</p>

<p><i>"The minstrel boy to the war is gone, in the ranks of death you will find him.<br/>
His father's sword he has girded on, and his wild harp slung behind him."</i></p>

<p>His father's sword, Shipman thought, staring into the fire. Yeah, that's what I got.</p>

<p><i>"Land of song, said the warrior-bard, though all the world betrays thee.<br/>
One sword at least thy right shall guard, one faithful harp shall praise thee."</i></p>

<p>Will
Shipman made up his mind. He knew a fellow who had a friend who worked
in the governor's office. Maybe there was a way he could discharge the
duty he was stuck with, officially. Mary would like that. Lord knows 
that in the Governor's sea of troubles he might not notice one more. 
Then again, maybe the contents of the mine would help a little, in the 
right hands. He'd make the call on Monday. Will blew hot breath on his
cold fingertips, and then held his hands palms out toward the fire, 
flexing his fingertips up and out, luxuriating in the warmth.</p>

<p><i>"The minstrel fell but the foeman's chains could not bring that proud soul under.<br/>
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again, for he tore its chords asunder,<br/>
And said 'no chain shall sully thee, the soul of love and bravery.<br/>
Thy songs were meant for the proud and free, they shall never sound in slavery!'"</i></p>

<p>"Never
sound in slavery." That was a cause in which Will Shipman had enlisted
a long time ago. It wasn't new to Winston County either.</p>

<p>Yes, he'd make that call on Monday, he surely would.</p>

<p>And Phil Gordon, he knew, would be pleased.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Charlie
Quintard was fishing down on the dock behind the house on Smith Lake 
when the Suburban turned up the road. It wasn't much of a road, but then
it wasn't much of a house. It was just a cabin really -- a kitchen, a 
bathroom (both of which took their water from the spring up the bluff) 
and the great room where Charlie had lived alone and slept alone these 
past five and a half years.</p>

<p>Quintard was humming "Simple Man" by 
the Charlie Daniels Band softly so as not to startle the fish. Beside 
him, his coon dog Push (short for Pushmataha) raised his head and 
growled.</p>

<p>"Quiet," ordered Charlie, "I'm fishin' here."</p>

<p>Push quit growling but stared up the hill in the direction of the cabin. Car doors slammed in the distance.</p>

<p>Charlie sighed to himself, "Here we go again."</p>

<p>He
knew who it was. Nobody came to Charlie's place, not even by accident. 
You had to WANT to find this place to get here, which was why Charlie 
liked it. In all the time he'd lived here, he'd never been visited by 
somebody he didn't know or hadn't invited, except once.</p>

<p>Until last week.</p>

<p>And now.</p>

<p>Putting his pole in the fixture on the dock, Charlie Quintard stood up, Push rising beside him.</p>

<p>"No," commanded Charlie, "Guard."</p>

<p>Push halted. The dog permitted himself a short whine to indicate his protest.</p>

<p>"Stay. Guard," repeated Charlie.</p>

<p>His
rod and fish bucket would be safe from all predators now and so would 
Push. The last bunch had been trigger happy and when they came up on 
Push unexpectedly they'd shot at him and missed. If they'd been better 
marksmen, well, Charlie didn't want to think on that. Phil always said 
they were big dog killers.</p>

<p>"Hello the house!" Charlie heard one 
of them shout. Well at least this bunch was more polite than the last. 
They'd just kicked in his door while he watched from the bluff above, 
and made a terrible mess of the place. Even stole one of his knives. One
of them later told Charlie that they thought nobody was home because 
they didn't see a car. Maybe this bunch had spotted the wisp of smoke 
coming out of his chimney, remnants of his breakfast fire in the cast 
iron stove in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hello the house!" came the call again, louder.</p>

<p>"Hello yourself," Charlie replied amiably as he rounded the corner.</p>

<p>Four
men in body armor and load bearing vests stood in front of the 
Suburban, spread out, weapons held at the ready. Two more stood behind 
the open front doors of the SUV, rifles pointed toward the cabin, ready 
to give covering fire if needed. All pivoted their weapons to point at 
Charlie.</p>

<p>Huh, six of them this time, Charlie noted silently, and 
better armed too. They were nervous though, Quintard could tell. Charlie
kept his hands where they could see them.</p>

<p>"How can I help you fellers?" Charlie asked.</p>

<p>His
voice was calm, steady, even friendly. Good, thought Charlie. I shoulda
been an actor. He smiled inwardly to match the one on his face. He 
could see the agents were unimpressed.</p>

<p>"Is this Phil Gordon's place?" one demanded.</p>

<p>"Yup,
he owns it, but I've been renting it now fer 'bout near six years now. I
pay him a year's rent in advance every June with my tax refund. I sorta
watch the place fer him. Before I moved in, he found a buncha squatters
running a meth lab in it. Been in his family fer years."</p>

<p>"Well,"
said one of the agents (his last name was Allen) with a malicious grin,
"you'll have to find another place to live, Bubba. This place belongs 
to the U.S. government now."</p>

<p>"Name's Charlie."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"My name's Charlie, not Bubba. Charlie Quintard."</p>

<p>"You got any guns, Charlie?" demanded the first one, who was apparently the leader.</p>

<p>"Does it look like I do?" letting a slight exasperation bleed into his still-friendly voice.</p>

<p>"I mean in the house," the leader clarified.</p>

<p>"Naw. Don't own one. Don't need 'em."</p>

<p>"Any of Phil's hidden around the place?"</p>

<p>"Not that he ever tole me."</p>

<p>"You mind if we look?"</p>

<p>It wasn't a question nor the least bit friendly.</p>

<p>"Naw, go right ahead. Them other fellers you sent did too and they didn't find nothin'."</p>

<p>All
six agents came instantly alert. If Charlie's amiable conversation had 
taken the edge off some of their wariness, it was gone now.</p>

<p>"They were here?" the leader demanded.</p>

<p>"Shore,
just like y'all but dressed in their shiny go-to-meetin' suits. One of 
'em, said his name was Henderson, came up to nail some legal notice on 
the door. Said Mr. Gordon was a cop killer and he was dead and I was 
E-victed."</p>

<p>"Where'd they go?" demanded the leader.</p>

<p>"How'd I
know? They drove off in a truck just like that," said Charlie pointing 
at the Suburban. "They got excited when I tole them 'bout Phil's other 
place and they went off lookin' for it. Reckon they found it, 'cause I 
ain't seen 'em since."</p>

<p>"What other place?"</p>

<p>"The one at 
Dead Man's Hollow (only Charlie pronounced it 'Holler'). Phil's family 
had a homestead there more than a hundred an' eighty years ago."</p>

<p>The
first team's Suburban had been found parked neatly behind the Winston 
County Sheriff's Office in Double Springs. No one had a clue how it had 
gotten there. The four man team had vanished. It should be noted for the
record that no one thought they were on an unannounced vacation in 
Vegas. And the local LEOs, as was usual these days, were uncooperative. 
How much of the Sheriff Department's mystification was real and how much
was an act was the subject of great debate at the ATF office in 
Birmingham, where both teams had come from.</p>

<p>The team leader was unimpressed with Charlie's history lesson and started issuing orders.</p>

<p>"Allen,
keep an eye on him. Chambliss and Duncan, search the house. You two," 
indicating the men behind the doors, "stay here and cover us."</p>

<p>"Hey,
wait," protested Charlie, "My dog is down by the dock. Can I call him 
up? That last bunch shot at him, but he wouldn't hurt a fly."</p>

<p>The leader, whose name was Carmichael, hesitated. Finally, he nodded his assent.</p>

<p>Charlie
yelled, "Push! Come here boy!" and then added as the agents moved 
toward the cabin, "You don't have to kick in the door like them last 
fellers. It's unlocked."</p>

<p>They kicked it in anyway.</p>

<p>Push 
loped up the hill in easy strides and came to rest at Charlie's feet. 
Quintard bent down and welcomed his only close friend, scratching him 
behind the ears and praising him.</p>

<p>"Good boy. Well done."</p>

<p>This
was actually working out better than the first time, Charlie thought. 
Maybe nobody gets shot at today. Maybe, he prayed, nobody dies. He began
humming "Simple Man" again, as the agents tore apart his cabin.</p>

<p><i>"Now I'm the kind of man who wouldn't harm a mouse,<br/>
But if I catch somebody breakin' in my house,<br/>
I've got a twelve gauge shotgun waitin' on the other side.<br/>
So don't go pushin' me against my will<br/>
I don't want to fight you but I durn sure will,<br/>
So if you don't want trouble you'd better just pass me on by."</i></p>

<p>Charlie
was a simple man and led a simple, spartan existence. There was no 
phone in the cabin, no radio or TV so there was no cable. Nor was there a
computer, electric heaters, lamps or toasters. Charlie Quintard lived 
off the grid.</p>

<p>He had once been an IT specialist for HealthSouth 
down in Birmingham, but the hours were crazy, the pressure intense and 
the supervision positively anal. Still he was doing pretty well for a 
Winston County boy whose daddy had been a coal miner when he managed to 
get himself fired. His boss had discovered one morning that, buried in 
the detail of a historic painting of the <a href="http://www.canerossi.us/ftmims/massacre.htm">Massacre at Fort Mims</a> that Charlie used as a screen saver, there were two faces which he had modified from the original.</p>

<p>One was Charlie's, superimposed on the body of a Creek brave, knife in the air.</p>

<p>The
other was that of Richard Scrushy, the universally feared and despised 
CEO of HealthSouth, which had been electronically pasted onto the body 
of a white settler about to be scalped.</p>

<p>When Charlie lost his 
job, he lost his wife, his house and his taste for the outside world. 
Quintard retreated into the Bankhead National Forest of his youth, 
trying to get his head straight. He'd chanced across Phil Gordon, a 
boyhood friend of his daddy, in a convenience store in Addison one day, 
shortly after Phil's encounter with the meth lab.</p>

<p>There was an 
identity of interest. Phil needed a house sitter and Charlie needed 
shelter in a place away from the world. Now, more than five years later,
Charlie still enjoyed the solitude and Richard Scrushy, his humorless 
ex-boss was doing time in the federal slammer for corporate misdeeds, 
thus proving to Charlie Quintard the existence of a just God. The fact 
that Charlie's annual rent was merely one dollar was none of the ATF's 
business.</p>

<p>But because Charlie was a simple man, the search, if 
the clumsy tossing of his personal effects to no purpose could be called
a search, didn't take long.</p>

<p>Charlie had told them the truth. 
There were no firearms on the place. They did find his personal hunting 
knife and a half-dozen others in various stages of manufacture. They 
found his traditional bow and a quiver full of flint-tipped arrows. They
tipped over his flint napping table and scattered his flints and tools 
across the greatroom floor. They found his tomahawk, emblazoned with the
signs of his clan and tribe, for Charlie Quintard was three-quarter 
Cherokee.</p>

<p>They found, and threw to the floor, his many books on 
the early history of Alabama, Indian lore and primitive weapons and 
survival skills. They searched though his bulk foods that he kept in 5 
gallon plastic pails, ruining some of it and spilling more. And then 
they found his medicine bag.</p>

<p>It hadn't occurred to Charlie that 
the feds would mess with his sacred artifact, so when he saw Duncan come
out with the ornately beaded bag in his outstretched hand, he startled.</p>

<p>"Hey boss," yelled Duncan, "Look at this."</p>

<p>"What's in it?" asked Carmichael.</p>

<p>"NO!" Charlie yelled and started for the porch. "That's my medicine bag! You CAN'T!"</p>

<p>"What
kind of medicine? Pot?" asked Duncan as he dumped the contents out onto
a table that stood on the porch to the right of the door. It looked 
like junk to the agent -- a feather, a rock, some sticks and... 
something Duncan had never seen before.</p>

<p>It was an ancient panther
claw. Charlie had found it when wandering in the Sipsey Wilderness. The
Alabama black panther had been believed to be extinct after about 1920 
or so, but their banshee cries at night had been recently heard again by
more than one Winston Countian, including Charlie.</p>

<p>The claw was 
powerful medicine and though Charlie's forward motion was stopped by the
muzzle of Allen's M-4, Push was not deterred.</p>

<p>In a blur he 
closed the distance between him and Duncan, flying up the steps and into
the air, going for Duncan's throat. Duncan stood as if rooted to the 
spot. Allen never wavered from covering Charlie.</p>

<p>Chambliss was 
inside and the two riflemen at the Suburban didn't have a clean shot. 
That left Carmichael, who was standing off to the side. As the dog 
leaped, he presented a full profile to the senior agent. Still, if he 
hadn't had his hand on his pistol he'd never have cleared leather. But 
he did, and he shot Pushmataha on the way by, hitting him with two of 
four shots. The lifeless dog hit Duncan squarely and knocked him ass 
over tit back into the doorway.</p>

<p>"NO!" screamed Charlie again. But
even in his agony he did not lose his presence of mind. Allen still had
him covered and seemed even more eager now to kill him than before. For
one thing, the agent was smiling.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, thought Charlie, you've done this thing before, haven't you, you bastard? You LIKE it.</p>

<p>For
his part, Allen was disappointed. By now, the agent figured, this 
hillbilly schmuck should have given him reason to blow his head off. 
This guy was either too smart, too stupid or too scared to do anything, 
and Allen tended to believe the last two rather than the first. Living 
this far out in the woods without a gun? That was just plain stupid. 
Yeah, sneered the agent to himself, Forrest Gump here was just a scared 
sheep like so many he'd seen over the years.</p>

<p>Used to be, Allen 
thought of himself as a sheepdog like most cops did. Not any more. It 
was a different world now. And after he helped pick up the bodies on 
Sipsey Street, Allen decided he would tell himself no more lies.</p>

<p>If
being a wolf was what it took to survive, then he would be a wolf. One 
of the reasons he liked working for Carmichael was that the supervisory 
agent had made the same choice.</p>

<p>Allen knew that the only reason 
Carmichael had let the hick call his dog up was so they could set up a 
plausible incident and kill them both. The way Carmichael was looking at
him now, Allen realized he had screwed up. The senior agent was pissed 
that Allen hadn't taken his opportunity. Excuses could be manufactured 
later, and who would say different?</p>

<p>Allen caught Carmichael's 
attention with an arched eyebrow and slight uptick of his muzzle toward 
Charlie. The senior agent shook his head imperceptibly. You missed your 
chance, wait for the next one.</p>

<p>"Go get your dog, asshole," Allen told Charlie.</p>

<p>Charlie
shuffled like a zombie up to the steps, pulling himself up the rail by 
what seemed to be superhuman effort. With a sob, he dropped to his knees
beside the coon dog, cradling it in his arms and rocking back and forth
slightly. He was crying.</p>

<p>Yeah, thought Allen disdainfully, just a
sheep. Now, if Carmichael has this prick figured right, he's going to 
go inside and either suck up his pitiful guts and come at us out the 
front with his worthless prehistoric weapons, or he will try to boogie 
out the back for the river. Allen had him figured for the back but he 
didn't intend to kill him right away. They still needed to find out 
where this dead man's whatever place was. Gotta give him some rope to 
hang himself though. Make him think he's got a chance. Yeah, Allen saw, 
Carmichael had it figured that way too.</p>

<p>Charlie rose with 
Pushmataha and entered the cabin. At a gesture from Carmichael, Duncan 
and Chambliss came out of the cabin and down the steps, moving to the 
right and clearing the field of fire for the shooters at the Suburban. 
Turning, they now formed a perfect L-shaped ambush. Allen knew he was 
the plug in the drain.</p>

<p>As Allen ambled down toward the side of 
the cabin, Chambliss took a last glance in the door. "He's just kneeling
by the bed," he told the others.</p>

<p>Allen hoped he was right and 
the Indian lost his nerve and ran out the back. If one of them had to go
back into the cabin, they'd be within knife range. Of course they could
Waco the place and burn it down. But the moron didn't even have a 
single barrel twelve to give them an excuse, and nobody but a Buddhist 
monk committed suicide by burning themselves to death, no matter what 
Janet Reno said. Besides, the only gasoline on the place was in the 
Suburban's tank. He hadn't even seen so much as a kerosene lantern.</p>

<p>So
let him run out the back, Allen decided. He moved along in no 
particular hurry. If the rube bolted toward the lake, Allen had a good 
clean shot for at least 75 yards. Keeping close to the structure to 
avoid being seen from the side windows, the agent came around the 
chimney headed for the back corner of the cabin.</p>

<p>This was going to be easy.</p>

<p>Charlie
Quintard waited, nestled into the back angle of the chimney. He had to 
do this quietly. He couldn't brain him with his tomahawk and he couldn't
just slit the agent's throat. Contrary to the movies, both of those 
means of taking out a sentry were audible for some distance. If he tried
either, Charlie would be heard in the front.</p>

<p>When Allen was at a
45 degree angle to his front and left, Charlie seized the agent's head 
and pulled it to the left as he brought the knife HARD through the back 
of his neck and into the medulla oblongata. He violently moved the knife
back and forth, "scrambling his eggs" as someone once said. The result 
was instant and virtually silent incapacitation. Allen didn't have time 
to do anything but twitch, and die. Charlie removed his knife and 
lowered Allen's body to the ground, half turning him as he did so so he 
could reach the agent's face. He then took a second or two to silently 
carve up ATF Special Agent Hank Allen's face with horizontal and lateral
strokes of the knife and to separate his nose and ears from his head. 
The agent's dead eyes were still wide in surprise when Charlie Quintard 
moved quietly away from him, angling away from the cabin toward the 
river and the nearest brush.</p>

<p>He was deep into the trees when the first horrified shouts heralded the discovery of Allen's body.</p>

<p><i>"Well, you know what's wrong with the world today?<br/>
People done gone and put their Bibles away.<br/>
They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land."</i></p>

<p><i>"Well the Good Book says, and I know its the truth,<br/>
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.<br/>
You'd better watch where you go<br/>
And remember where you've been.<br/>
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man."</i></p>

<p>Carmichael was scared and angry. God, was there NOTHING simple about this Gordon case?</p>

<p>It
was obvious now what had happened to the first team. This bastard's act
had conned them all, including him. But there was no way he was going 
to chase this guy, this Indian, this WARRIOR, into the brush on his own 
home turf with just four other guys. We'd be picked off one by one. And 
Carmichael, sheepdog turned wolf or not, intended to live to collect his
pension. Or at least, he reflected, to escape to a non-extradition 
country if we don't win what is rapidly turning into a civil war.</p>

<p>Carmichael
tried his cell phone again. No signal. They'd lost radio contact when 
they came down off the mountain to the lake. Besides, there was all 
kinds of interference these days. The smart boys in DC said it was 
deliberate jamming by radio operators and commo hackers who were 
sympathetic to killer gun nuts like Gordon. And only tactical teams had 
the good satellite phones. This was supposed to be a milk run.</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>And now there was this "Dead Man's Hollow." Was that where the Indian was headed?</p>

<p>Would they find the dead from the first team there?</p>

<p>Did it even exist?</p>

<p>Was it all a lie?</p>

<p>Carmichael decided.</p>

<p>"Back to the Suburban," he ordered. "We'll come back with more people. Leave Allen. We'll get him when we come back."</p>

<p>The
other agents sagged in relief. The last thing they wanted to do was 
handle that bloody corpse. Allen's mutilation had shocked them in a way 
that even those among them who had been combat veterans in another life 
couldn't get their minds around.</p>

<p>This was <i>AMERICA</i>. We're the <i>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</i>. This isn't supposed to happen to one of <i>US</i>.</p>

<p>Of
course, this was exactly the effect Charlie Quintard had in mind when 
he did it. Scared men, jumpy men, make mistakes. And at five to one, 
Charlie needed all the help he could make for himself.</p>

<p>Chambliss 
had policed up Allen's weapons. Funny thing about that, Carmichael 
thought, the Indian had left the dead agent's M-4 and pistol. Didn't he 
know how to use them?</p>

<p>As Charlie ran through the woods, he was 
making a mental inventory of his options and an evaluation of his enemy 
much like Carmichael. Quintard had his knife, his 'hawk, his primitive 
bow and a quiver which held a dozen flint-tipped arrows. He stopped 
briefly to string his bow, then he was off again at a lope, circling 
around to the road the Suburban had come in on. It wasn't that he didn't
know how to use firearms. It was just that he was BETTER with the 
weapons he carried. He'd been living with them, and by them, for more 
than five years now. When you eat only as well as you can hunt, you get 
good at it. That's what made his skill at the bow.</p>

<p>As for the 
knife and the 'hawk, he was also good in close with them. The only 
social occasions he attended away from his cabin were centered around 
edged weapons and primitive close combat skills. He sold the knives he 
made and the flint arrowheads he napped to other primitive hunters and 
frontier re-enactors. For the past five years his life had worked like 
this.</p>

<p>Every so often he'd hike out to the main road and thumb a 
ride into the Double Springs Post Office. Once there, he'd pick up his 
mail, cash his postal money orders, and mail off the products of his 
labor to a growing customer base. After that, he'd go down to the 
library to scan the newspapers and magazines. Jill Shipman, the 
librarian, had taken Charlie under her wing sometime before and she let 
him buy new books on the library discount card and would always save any
discards she thought he might like, selling them to him for a quarter 
apiece. After the library, Charlie would head to the Piggly Wiggly (he 
hated and shunned WalMart) and pick up items for his larder. Every now 
and then, he would go to the Ace Hardware for a tool, or some nails. 
When he was done, he'd hire the Piggly Wiggly stock boy to drive him 
back home with his plunder in the stock boy's pickup.</p>

<p>Ten or 
twelve times a year, a buddy would come by to pick him up and together 
they'd go to a mountain man rendezvous or a re-enactment like Fort Mims 
way down state near Mobile. They'd camp rough and compete in edged 
weapons contests -- with wooden knives and 'hawks in hand-to-hand 
matches, and with cold steel in throws for accuracy. Throwing or 
hand-to-hand, there were few better than Charlie Quintard.</p>

<p>Charlie
had never joined the army. Those few who knew him thought that was 
probably a good thing. Putting up with the Army's idea of discipline was
not in Charlie Quintard's internal makeup. He had self-discipline of 
course. Anyone who hunts for subsistence or ekes by his life on the thin
bounty of the north Alabama woods is a model of patient discipline.</p>

<p>In the peacetime Army, Charlie Quintard would have been an abject failure as a soldier.</p>

<p>In a war, well, somewhere in those Cherokee genes of his lurked a warrior.</p>

<p>Charlie
had learned that about himself. You see, the meth heads that Phil 
Gordon had run off came back about a year afterward, after Charlie had 
settled in. They had guns, Charlie had a knife and his trusty 'hawk. (He
was still partly on the grid then, and he hadn't yet acquired his 
primitive bow.)</p>

<p>The meth heads laughed, and then died in terminal
surprise as Charlie first evaded and then caught them up close one or 
two at a time. There were eight of them. After disabling their vehicles,
it had taken him two days. It was the first time he showed anyone the 
way to Dead Man's Holler, which was in fact a real place.</p>

<p>The first ATF team had been the second.</p>

<p>This was the third.</p>

<p>So yes, Charlie Quintard had learned the way of the warrior.</p>

<p>And
there was something else that Charlie Quintard had learned. There are 
no obsolete weapons. There are only obsolete ways of employing them - 
obsolete tactics, if you will. An English longbowman of the 14th 
Century, if transplanted to the 21st, could still kill a man at 
distance. He just wouldn't stand in a row in an open field to do it like
he had at Agincourt or Crecy.</p>

<p>In fact, in a technological 
society that placed gunfire detectors everywhere in its cities, there 
was an argument to be made that a "primitive" weapon which was 
essentially silent might be of increased utility despite the fact that 
it had been invented a couple of millenia before.</p>

<p>Also, when you grabbed a man by his belt buckle, a knife or a 'hawk was just as good a way to kill him as any other.</p>

<p>All
this Charlie knew. And he knew one other thing. The only way this was 
going to work was if they just disappeared like the first bunch. He had 
to get them all before they were able to climb out of the dead zone that
kept them from communicating with their bosses back in Birmingham.</p>

<p>He was, Charlie Quintard knew, going to have to take them to Dead Man's Holler.</p>

<p>That
thought took him as far as the big tree above the road cut. The road, 
like almost all roads in Winston County, had first been an animal track,
then an Indian trail, a wagon road and finally a one lane passage for 
automobiles and logging trucks. Over the years it had worn down until it
was a cut at least three feet deep along the length of it leading back 
to the cabin.</p>

<p>What the ATF didn't know was that this was actually
the old road to Dead Man's Hollow, although you wouldn't find it on any
modern map. The road had run past the Gordon homestead, turned left 
just about where the boat dock jutted out into Smith Lake and snaked up 
the bluff for about 800 yards before it descended toward the old river 
bed and Dead Man's Hollow. When the Alabama Power Company built the dam 
in the Thirties and Smith Lake had backed up behind it, the rising 
waters filled up to just below the bluff, where the old road now 
dead-ended.</p>

<p>So the only way out was past this old pine and 
Charlie, figuring that sooner or later he'd find himself at this moment,
had not only chopped the tree partway through, he'd left the axe nearby
so, if needed, he could finish the job without delay. Dropping his 
weapons, he snatched up the axe and attacked the pine with a frenzy. He 
heard the Suburban start, and redoubled his efforts. Just as the ATF 
rounded the curve, the tree dropped with a mighty sustained craaaack and
blocked the path. The gun cops' vehicle was trapped.</p>

<p>The feds 
vented their fear and frustration by leaping from the Suburban and 
blasting away at where Charlie had been. The truth was that Allen's 
ruined features and their sudden reversal of fortune had unnerved the 
agents. They wanted out of here NOW and they thought they could shoot 
their way clear of this wimp who had somehow transmogrified into an 
invisible deadly menace.</p>

<p>The truth also was that here, for the first time in his career, Carmichael lost control of his men.</p>

<p>Without
orders, two of them, Furlong and James, clambered up the bank to get at
Charlie and finish this thing. As they appeared at the top of the road 
cut only 25 yards separated them from Charlie Quintard, sheltered behind
another big pine. Their heads popped into view first.</p>

<p>In an 
instant, Furlong pitched backward with the fletching of an arrow in his 
left eye and a piece of flint on a broken stick protruding out the back 
of his brain pan.</p>

<p>James, right beside him, turned his head to 
look at his friend fall long enough to get a similar arrow through his 
jugular, slicing down, chipping the clavicle and then, thanks to the 
angle of the shot, skewering his heart. He fell dead in the brush at the
top of the road cut, his booted feet hanging at an angle over the road.</p>

<p>Carmichael
was seized by panic and wonder. Damn! Nobody can shoot a bow and arrow 
that fast! Could they? Are there two of them? More than two? For the 
first time in his life, Carmichael had the feeling he wasn't going to be
alive when the sun came up tomorrow. He didn't like the feeling.</p>

<p>He
wasn't a religious man but Carmichael realized with a start that if 
there was a God of Abraham, He wouldn't be too pleased about some of the
ATF supervisor's recent work. And Carmichael did not think that he 
would get a chance to amend his life after today.</p>

<p>It was 
unbelievable. Focus, dammit. Get a grip. Carmichael struggled to regain 
command of himself. How do we beat this guy? Look at our advantages. We 
outnumber him, but he's already cut us down by half. We've got automatic
rifles and submachine guns. He's just got a bow, some arrows, a knife 
and maybe that tomahawk. But after losing 3 guys that didn't look like 
such a big deal either. We've got flash bangs, but they're not so 
effective out in the open.</p>

<p>Carmichael realized with a start that 
he was gazing at Furlong on the road with an arrow sticking out of his 
eye. Helmets. Yeah, they had ACH's in the back of the Suburban. Why 
hadn't he made his people use them? And CS grenades and gas masks. They 
were also in the back. We've been dancing to his tune, Carmichael 
thought. Time to change the dynamic and make him dance to ours.</p>

<p>They
were all on the far side of the Suburban from where Charlie had fired 
the arrows. Chambliss was up near the front tire, Duncan in the middle 
and Carmichael at the rear bumper. A plan formed in Carmichael's fevered
brain.</p>

<p>It would work. It had to work.</p>

<p>Charlie also had a 
plan, and he knew he would have to waste at least one arrow to make it 
work. When he saw Duncan open the driver's side passaenger door on the 
far side, he fired arrow number three into the passenger door on his 
side with a loud thunk that made the remaining agents duck. Then he 
moved.</p>

<p>Bastard, thought Carmichael. Thanks for telling me your 
position. When Duncan emerged from the interior of the Suburban, he 
brought helmets, gas masks and all the CS grenades they had. Carmichael 
told his remaining men what he wanted done. All together. No holding 
back. They nodded. Then they donned the gas masks and helmets.</p>

<p>When
Carmichael judged they were ready, he first threw a CS grenade at the 
top of the bank to mask their movement. The wind, such as it was, 
carried the CS cloud slowly away from the road and toward Charlie's 
position. Then they emerged from behind the vehicle, and threw six more 
CS grenades in an arc along their front creating a growing bank of the 
choking gas. Last, they threw their flashbangs into the murk. As they 
released the last of the flashbangs, Carmichael and Chambliss began to 
clamber up the bank while Duncan stood and fired suppressing bursts to 
pin Charlie Quintard in place behind his tree.</p>

<p>It was a good 
plan, if a bit desperate. If they had kept their heads and done it 
before Furlong and James had bought the farm it might have worked.</p>

<p>The only problem was - Charlie wasn't there.</p>

<p>Duncan's
first intimation that this was so came when a flint-tipped arrow 
entered just above and slightly to the right of his anus and penetrated 
his scrotum, one of his testicles and the base of his penis. It appeared
in the lower edge of his peripheral vision, sticking out of his fly 
like some stone age parody of an erection. Duncan lost all interest in 
suppressive fire. In fact, he dropped his weapon, fell to his knees, 
clasped his hands around the gory arrow and his ruined manhood, and 
began to scream.</p>

<p>By the time Carmichael's brain registered that 
scream and concluded that something was terribly wrong with Duncan 
behind him, somebody hit him hard in the kidneys and his body armor 
sprouted a similar arrow from his lower back. Then Chambliss, stopping 
his climb and turning to see what all the fuss was about, took one 
through his right thigh laterally and slid back down the bank, adding 
his screaming to Duncan's.</p>

<p>HE'S BEHIND US, Carmichael's brain screamed at him.</p>

<p>For
a man who was as frightened and disoriented as Carmichael at this 
moment, he actually did rather well. He glimpsed Charlie about to loose 
another arrow at him. In fact, all he saw was the top part of Charlie's 
bow and the head and shoulders behind it.</p>

<p>It was enough. He raised his MP-5 and let off a long burst that emptied it.</p>

<p>For
the uninitiated and untrained, full automatic fire is of limited 
utility except when fighting the Peoples Liberation Army in an alley. 
Absent divine intervention or uncommon luck, at anything except short 
ranges 99 shots out of a hundred will miss. So it was here with 
Carmichael's burst at Charlie Quintard. Of course Charlie's decision to 
hold the arrow shot and duck behind the tree when he saw the MP-5 start 
to rise was also a big factor in his continued existence on the planet.</p>

<p>Whew, that was close, he thought with relief. Time to go.</p>

<p>Charlie
dropped to the forest floor out of sight of the men in the road cut and
began to crawl away. Behind him, Carmichael changed magazines and, 
keeping low, turned toward the chorus of screams.</p>

<p>Chambliss had 
made his way over to the shelter of the Suburban and was fumbling with a
battle dressing. Duncan just stayed where the arrow had found him, 
screaming on and on. Carmichael took it all in at a glance. Realizing 
Duncan could help him no longer and desperately craving silence to 
think, Carmichael came up behind the agent, drew his pistol and, placing
the muzzle just below the back lip of the wounded man's ACH, blew his 
brains out. Duncan spasmed and fell over on his side in the road, his 
agony of no further concern to anybody, including him.</p>

<p>Chambliss watched him dully, wondering despite the pain if Carmichael was going to do him too. He wasn't. Not yet.</p>

<p>But
what he was going to do was get the hell out of this killing zone. 
First, if Chambliss is going to be of use, that arrow has got to come 
out. Carmichael knelt down and without warning grabbed the business end 
of the arrow that was sticking out from Chambliss' thigh and broke it 
off. Chambliss, not unexpectedly, screamed once more. Then, Carmichael 
grabbed the fletching sticking out of the other side and jerked the 
arrow free, a greasy tongue of blood trying to follow along. Using his 
combat knife, he cut the uniform pants away from the wound, then took 
the battle dressing from Chambliss' shaking hand and applied it. Then he
had Chambliss pull the arrow out of his body armor.</p>

<p>"Ready to travel?" Carmichael asked.</p>

<p>Chambliss replied, "Yeah. Where?"</p>

<p>"We're going back down to the lake and see if this prick has a boat."</p>

<p>The
Suburban motor still ticked over. Carefully, staying as low as 
possible, they got Chambliss in the front passenger side. Carmichael 
moved around the vehicle to take the wheel. As he passed Charlie's third
arrow sticking out of the door, he angrily broke it off.</p>

<p>Stone age weapons. Shit.</p>

<p>If he got out of this, he was going to have this place nuked.</p>

<p>Sonofabitch.</p>

<p>Suddenly,
randomly, a memory from the Nineties welled up. He had helped execute a
search warrant on a member of the American Indian Movement. The old 
Sioux woman had a bumpersticker on her refrigerator door: "Custer Wore 
an Arrow Shirt."</p>

<p>Carmichael had thought it funny then.</p>

<p>He didn't now.</p>

<p>Gaining
the driver's seat, he slammed the door and threw the Suburban into 
reverse, running over the bodies of Furlong and Duncan in the mad dash 
down to the lake.</p>

<p>Charlie heard the screaming and heard the shot.
In the silence that followed there was only one conclusion to draw. 
Damn, they're killing their own wounded. OK, so there were maybe two of 
them left. At least one of those was wounded, for he heard other, 
different screams after the shot. They'll go for the lake now. He knew 
it.</p>

<p>Even so, he waited for the Suburban to move as proof of his 
guess. Yeah, the SUV was faster than he was, but he had a straight line 
to run to get down there, while the Suburban had to stick to the snaky 
road. The Suburban moved, and Charlie Quintard began to run.</p>

<p>What
if there wasn't a boat? Carmichael wondered as he backed frantically 
down the road. The Indian didn't have a car, why would he have a boat? 
In retrospect, Carmichael couldn't believe how stupid he'd been, how 
arrogant and ignorant. He'd completely misread the Indian and mishandled
the whole deal. Why didn't we search the whole place, including the 
dock? I'd know if there was a boat then. Forget that. There HAD to be a 
boat there, so there must be one. It was the last thread he clung to. He
really, really didn't want to die here beside this godforsaken cabin.</p>

<p>And, after a fashion, he got his wish.</p>

<p>There
were large privet bushes blocking the path of the Suburban from the 
dock, and they also blocked Carmichael's view of the lake. In his panic,
Carmichael failed to note that what appeared to be a driveway that dead
ended at the privet actually turned to the left and went up the bluff. 
If he'd known he wouldn't have cared. It was the lake that beckoned him.
It was only on the lake that he might escape this uncanny, vengeful 
Indian with his deadly stone age weapons. The lake would save him.</p>

<p>When
the Suburban stopped, Carmichael leaped from it with his MP-5. His 
intention was to leave the hobbled Chambliss to the Indian's tender 
mercies and thus buy himself enough time to escape.</p>

<p>Chambliss 
tumbled from the vehicle too and realized instantly what the plan was. 
"Wait!" he had time to yell, then went down as another of Charlie's 
arrows hit him in the buttocks and drove through to sever the femoral 
artery in his left leg.</p>

<p>Chambliss pitched forward on his face, 
out of the fight. He wasn't dead yet, but he would be shortly. Roger 
Chambliss gave himself up to the idea, and spent his last minutes on 
earth thinking about his wife and kids and what an idiot he'd been not 
to listen to Carol when she'd begged him to get out of the ATF after 
Sipsey Street. When he went to meet his Maker, it was in fear that he 
would receive what he deserved.</p>

<p>Carmichael saw Chambliss go down 
and he realized belatedly that Charlie had been firing low to hit them 
where they weren't covered by helmet or body armor. As he ran from the 
Suburban toward and around the privet and heading for the dock, he 
loosed off a burst toward the cabin where Charlie must be sheltering.</p>

<p>Charlie
was on the side of the cabin away from the Suburban and moving to the 
rear so he could get a shot at Carmichael if he showed himself in the 
direction of the lake. The same cleared space that Agent Allen had 
intended to use against him now worked in his favor. Carmichael would 
not be able to get down there without exposing himself to Charlie's bow.</p>

<p>Even
so, Carmichael tried. The first arrow missed, the second hit Carmichael
in the right bicep breaking his upper arm and pinning it it to his body
armor. He staggered, but kept going. The next arrow also missed, but 
the fourth hit him in the ankle and swept him from his feet, and he 
landed hard still well short of the dock. The pain was excruciating.</p>

<p>Charlie was down to one arrow, which was nocked and ready to fly. There were more in the cabin, but for right now, this was it.</p>

<p>Carmichael
still had his MP-5 and his pistol, but his ability to use them was 
strictly limited by his injuries. He never practiced weak-side shooting,
thinking he'd never need it. He doubted he could even get to his pistol
with his left hand and while he could spray and pray with the MP-5, he 
doubted he could hit Charlie unless he presented himself meekly for 
execution.</p>

<p>This did not seem likely.</p>

<p>So Carmichael did the only thing left to him that he could think of.</p>

<p>He surrendered.</p>

<p>"HEY!"
he yelled. "Hey! I surrender! Don't shoot me anymore!" With his left 
hand he fumbled with the attachment point of the MP-5's sling.</p>

<p>"Throw
away your guns!" responded Charlie. "I'm trying," said Carmichael 
weakly. Finally, he unhooked the subgun and tossed it away. He tried to 
reach the pistol and couldn't. He told Charlie so.</p>

<p>"All right. 
Just keep quiet and don't move," Charlie ordered. He moved up to the 
wounded Carmichael. Careful, Charlie told himself. Carmichael seemed 
deep into an appreciation of his pain, but it could be an act. He 
approached from Carmichael's wounded right side, dropped his bow and 
drew his knife. He held the knife to Carmichael's throat while he 
stripped him of his pistol and tossed it away. Then he did the same with
the ATF man's combat knife. He was about to help Carmichael up when he 
spotted something familiar sticking out of his combat pants' cargo 
pocket.</p>

<p>It was his medicine bag. Carmichael saw Charlie 
Quintard's eyes narrow. He had taken it from Duncan on a lark, a 
souvenir he was going to give to his wife. But now he saw the look on 
Quintard's face and thought he saw a door closing.</p>

<p>"I wish you hadn't done that," said Charlie. He paused. "I wish you hadn't shot Push too."</p>

<p>"You said you wouldn't shoot me," Carmichael pleaded.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to shoot you," Charlie said in a hard, flat voice, "I'm going to take you to Dead Man's Holler."</p>

<p>Carmichael felt relief wash through him. "Where is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Charlie
ignored him. He stripped off Carmichael's helmet, webgear, and body 
armor with the ATF man alternately yelling and weeping in pain. He also 
broke off the arrows sticking out of Carmichael. He shreiked when the 
Indian did that.</p>

<p>"I gotta get to a doctor," Carmichael pleaded.</p>

<p>"You'll get a Doctor when you get to Dead Man's Holler," replied Charlie. "Where's your flexcuffs?"</p>

<p>"I don't carry them. I'm a supervisor. Chambliss might have some."</p>

<p>Charlie grunted. "Don't move," he ordered.</p>

<p>Carmichael,
holding onto the hope of Dead Man's Hollow, did as he was told. 
Policing up Carmichael's weapons and his own bow as he went, Charlie 
went over to Chambliss' still form by the Suburban. He was dead. He also
had two pairs of flexcuffs.</p>

<p>Leaving the weapons on the ground, 
Charlie returned to Carmichael and, pulling the zipties tight, he cuffed
the ATF man's hands and feet.</p>

<p>"Hey!" protested Carmichael, "You don't have to do that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Charlie. "I'll be back in a few minutes. Don't go anywhere," he said with a faint smile.</p>

<p>The ATF agent cursed, gritting his teeth in pain.</p>

<p>In
less than five minutes, Carmichael heard the Suburban drive away. And 
after a long half hour, it came back. Charlie appeared and hoisted 
Carmichael, first to his feet and then in a fireman's carry onto 
Quintard's back.</p>

<p>Even through his pain, Carmichael marveled at 
the Indian's strength. Damn, I'm twice his size and he tosses me around 
like a pillow.</p>

<p>When they got around the privet bushes, Carmichael
saw the Suburban was stacked with the bodies of his men, across the 
width of the back floor and seat. They had been systematically stripped 
of their weapons, helmets, body armor, radios and load bearing vests. 
Quintard had even taken their boots. Charlie set him down by the front 
passenger door, which was open. He was none too gentle and Carmichael 
screamed. Then Charlie picked him up and put him in the passenger seat. 
Taking one of the dead agent's belts he had scavenged, Quintard ran it 
through a bracket on the seat and the flex cuffs on Carmichael's legs, 
connecting the two.</p>

<p>"I'll drive," he said with another one of those enigmatic half-smiles.</p>

<p>The
Suburban smelled of blood, shit and brains as it ground its way up the 
bluff road toward Dead Man's Holler. Every bounce was a purgatory of 
pain for Carmichael. Charlie Quintard was humming, but Carmichael 
couldn't make out the tune. Finally, they came to the top, crested the 
bluff and began to go down. A few hundred yards later they were staring 
at the lake, which was about fifty yards down the hill. Charlie stopped 
the vehicle and set the parking brake.</p>

<p>Before he got out, Charlie
put down the all of the door windows in the vehicle about 2 inches or 
so. He took two more belts and secured the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Carmichael finally realized in horror what was about to happen. "You can't!" he shouted at Charlie.</p>

<p>"Hey,"
said Charlie, "None of that. You said you wanted to go to Dead Man's 
Holler and here we are. You see, it got its name from being a deep 
ravine down by the old river bed where, every now and again back in the 
1800s, somebody would dump a dead man's body in it. When Smith Lake 
backed up over it after they built the dam, it filled up with water and 
became the deepest part of the lake. Phil Gordon's family homestead used
to be down there. And that's where yer goin'."</p>

<p>"YOU CAN'T!" screamed Carmichael.</p>

<p>Charlie
Quintard looked at him without remorse. "That's what I said just before
you killed my dog." Charlie reached in, pulled the brake release and 
slammed the door as the Suburban surrendered to the force of gravity and
began to trundle down the road toward the water.</p>

<p>"NO!" he heard 
Carmichael scream, just before the vehicle hit the water with a huge 
splash and glided farther out into the lake just about dead center over 
Dead Man's Hollow. As the SUV began to settle into its final plunge, 
Charlie wondered if Carmichael knew why he called it 'Dead Man's Holler'
instead of 'Dead Man's Hollow'. Quintard was educated enough to know 
the correct pronunciation. Yeah, he spoke natural Winston County 
southern, so Hollow would normally come out 'Holler' anyway.</p>

<p>But he called it Dead Man's Holler for another reason.</p>

<p>Just as the SUV nosed down into its final dive, the dead man inside started to holler, "NOOOOO!"</p>

<p>He did so, until he ran out of air somewhere just short of the bottom of Smith Lake.</p>

<p>Charlie turned and walked back up the bluff. He still had to bury Pushmataha. Even so, he was humming.</p>

<p><i>"Well the Good Book says, and I know its the truth,<br/>
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.<br/>
You'd better watch where you go<br/>
And remember where you've been.<br/>
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man."</i></p>

<p>Sound is a funny thing.</p>

<p>In
the Civil War, entire battles were sometimes fought within a few miles 
of troops who passed the day unaware that their comrades-in-arms were 
fighting desperately. In other times and places, the sounds of battle 
have reverberated and carried for many miles. This is especially true 
across bodies of water.</p>

<p>You know, like Smith Lake.</p>

<p>For 
sound and fury, the skirmish at the old Gordon cabin hadn't been much as
skirmishes go, all the gunfire being one-sided. And Smith Lake and the 
Bankhead National Forest are no strangers to echoing gunshots from 
hunters, target shooters and occasional drunken white boys blasting 
holes in federal, state and local signage. But automatic weapons fire is
a bit rarer and would have drawn the notice of curious passersby -- not
that there were many of those in Charlie Quintard's neck of the woods 
-- even in the peaceful days before the Battle of Sipsey Street and the 
disappearance of the first four ATF agents right afterward.</p>

<p>But now?</p>

<p>Well,
now only an idiot would dismiss that episodic, fat-in-the-fire 
sustained crackle echoing through the woods and across the water as 
anything else but evidence that the undeclared civil war which had begun
on Sipsey Street had come home to Phil Gordon's birthplace.</p>

<p>Now 
as it happened only two people who heard the sounds of the death agony 
of the ATF's second team understood the probable cause of what they were
hearing. One was Jimmy Flynn, who had just turned 19 and was at the 
moment trying to get into Katy Dobson's drawers. The fact that Jimmy was
still in the preliminaries of talking Katy into what he had in mind 
played a part in his realization. Had he been farther along in the 
process he might not have noticed at all. But Katy was no pushover. In 
fact she had no intention of giving Jimmy what he wanted just then. Her 
own personal standards required at least an engagement ring before 
surrendering her secrets, even if she loved young Mr. Flynn, which she 
did.</p>

<p>So Jimmy was still in possession of his faculties when the first burst of pistol shots that killed Pushmataha rang out.</p>

<p>Huh,
he thought, that wasn't far away. Some feller with a semi-auto pistol 
shootin' a snake probably. There were plenty of snakes up this way.</p>

<p>The
rock with the beautiful view of the river that Jimmy had chosen for 
courting the hard-to-get Miss Dobson was probably the least snaky place 
around here, which was why he had chosen it. Nothing like an Eastern 
Diamondback rattler or a copperhead to ruin the mood.</p>

<p>But when 
the paroxysm of fire at the pine roadblock echoed up to him, Jimmy Flynn
knew exactly what was going on and he sat up straight. Damn, he 
thought. It's the ATF again. The Suburban had passed them on the main 
road before turning off in front of them, heading down to the old Gordon
place.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew about the ATF. Will Shipman, the commander of 
both his re-enactment unit and the newly organized Free State 
Constitutional Militia of which Jimmy was a proud member, had told him 
all about them. Jimmy idolized Will. He'd been places and done things 
that Jimmy dreamed he might one day see and do. Now, he heard the 
gunfire and realized that Will needed to know about this.</p>

<p>Having 
more youthful enthusiasm than sense, had Jimmy been on his own he might 
have moved toward the sound of the guns to discover what was really 
happening. But he couldn't do that with Katy in tow.</p>

<p>Katy, 
unmindful of the sound at first and not understanding a bit why Jimmy 
was no longer paying attention to HER, asked petulantly, "What's the 
matter?"</p>

<p>"That's gunfire," explained Jimmy.</p>

<p>Katy had heard
gunfire all her life. Everybody up in Winston County owned a gun and 
her daddy had taught her how to shoot from when she was tee-niney. She 
did not, however, have an educated ear for gunfire, nor was she 
particularly interested in it. What she was interested in was becoming 
Jimmy Flynn's wife and having his babies -- in that order.</p>

<p>"Somebody
shooting a snake," she explained. There were a whole lot more snakes 
than guns in Winston County, and anybody who lived outside of town had 
shot one, or seen one shot.</p>

<p>Jimmy started to explain that it was 
machinegun fire and nobody shot snakes with machineguns, but the natural
caution that his daddy had taught, and occasionally beat into, him took
over.</p>

<p>"Don't run your mouth," his daddy had said, "until you've 
got somethin' to say and you know who's listening." And one other thing -
"No woman ever kept a secret, except her own."</p>

<p>This much Jimmy 
could work out for himself. There were four ATF men missing. The whole 
county knew about the Suburban behind the Sheriff's Office. The feds 
were offering $10,000 for information about what might have happened to 
them. Everybody in town had a guess.</p>

<p>Will Shipman had told him 
with a wink, "I guess they ran into something in the woods. Maybe they 
were eaten by trolls." There were crackheads in town who had already 
sold their souls for far less and who would rat out their own mothers 
for a rock, but nobody had a clue.</p>

<p>And Will Shipman told Jimmy 
Flynn something else, "Well, its like my old Army buddy Scarpetti used 
to say, 'Three men can keep a secret if two of them are dead.'" Meaning 
whoever accomplished the disappearance of the ATF agents was probably 
working alone.</p>

<p>Which meant that, since the random disappearance 
of ATF agents in the wake of the agency's attack on Phil Gordon was 
viewed by almost everybody in Winston County, heck, the entire state of 
Alabama, as a positive social good, whoever was on the receiving end of 
that gunfire was doing the Lord's own work this day. Therefore, it would
not do to draw Katy Dobson's attention to it. Momma raised ugly kids, 
not dumb ones, Jimmy thought. That was something else his daddy had 
said.</p>

<p>So Jimmy Flynn gave up any thought of getting in Katy 
Dobson's drawers that day, laid back down beside her on the blanket and 
cuddled her, listening hard for more shots. In due time, as Charlie 
Quintard matched his bow and arrows against the ATF's M-4s and MP-5s, he
heard them.</p>

<p>When the flash bangs went off, though, even Katy sat up. "What was THAT?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh,"
said Jimmy, "I think its somebody celebrating with fireworks. Don't 
worry about it." And then he said something that he couldn't believe 
later he had, although the thought had been growing in him for some 
time. Strangely, the sounds of the war close by crystallized it for him.</p>

<p>"Katy,
would you marry me? I know I don't make much at the factory, but with 
times being the way they are now, I just don't think we should wait. 
Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>Katy was flabbergasted and forgot all about 
the bangs and booms. The campaign for Jimmy Flynn's wedding ring was 
carefully mapped out in her head and should have taken at least another 
three months. "Oh, yes, Jimmy, yes!"</p>

<p>They kissed then, and kept 
on kissing. In fact, Jimmy Flynn could have gotten into Katy Dobson's 
drawers at that moment, but strangely all he wanted to do was hold her 
tight as he listened intently to the sounds of the forest, the lake and 
the odd gunshots echoing across them.</p>

<p>Men, thought Katy. I'll never understand them. But she didn't care. She was going to be Mrs. Jimmy Flynn after all.</p>

<p>And wouldn't Lori Peterson just be jealous fit to bust?</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
other person who heard the shots and knew what he was hearing was 
Carter Johnson, the Sheriff of Winston County. Actually, the only shots 
that he heard came from the last burst of Carmichael's MP-5. He had been
headed north on the lake in his bass boat, christened "Semper Fi," with
his nephew Donald Waters, supposedly looking for the missing four ATF 
agents but actually to get away from the phones, the nagging press, the 
demanding feds and do a little bit of fishing. So, what with the noise 
of the motor going full-tilt-boogie and the bang of the water against 
the hull, Sheriff Johnson didn't hear anything.</p>

<p>Something penetrated his subconscious though.</p>

<p>Something was not right.</p>

<p>His
premonitions had served him well over the years, first in Vietnam and 
then in a lifetime in law enforcement, and he had learned to pay 
attention to them. The last time had been when he was about to kick in 
the door to an untended meth lab a few years back, and something nagged 
at his brain not to do it. He went around to the side of the trailer, 
stepped up on a milk crate and peeped in the window. There was a 
tripwire attached to the door. He couldn't see what it was attached to, 
but he decided to disassemble a back window and go in that way. It took 
him and the deputies 45 minutes to do that with the poor set of tools 
they had, but their patience was rewarded.</p>

<p>They got to live.</p>

<p>On
the other end of the trip wire was an M18A1 Claymore directional mine 
that was later determined to have been listed as "expended in training" 
back in the 1980s at Camp Shelby, Mississippi.</p>

<p>So when something 
niggled at the back of his head, something that his wife had called his 
"spider sense," Carter Johnson paid attention. He cut the boat motor and
listened.</p>

<p>Silence. Then, "Brrrrrp." Then, nothing.</p>

<p>He 
couldn't even tell what side of the lake it had come from. A 
submachinegun, though, he was certain. He waited for a second burst to 
help him, or some gunfire in reply but nothing happened. He turned to 
his nephew to see if he had heard it and saw his head bobbing up and 
down to the MP-3 player.</p>

<p>Moron.</p>

<p>For a few minutes more he sat there waiting, until his nephew got curious and asked why they'd stopped.</p>

<p>"Thought
I heard something," Johnson growled. He was beginning to think that 
hiring his nephew as a deputy was the biggest mistake he'd ever made in 
life, up to and including the time he stepped in a punji trap during 
Operation Tuscaloosa at An Hoa in 1967.</p>

<p>There wasn't a thing 
about the boy that didn't irritate him and if his sister hadn't begged 
him in front of their sainted mother he wouldn't have brought him on 
board. The kid was only here in the boat to be his flunky anyway, to 
hand out the beer and bait the hooks, which unfortunately was all he was
qualified for. Skeeter Haynes, former Birmingham police captain and his
likely primary opposition had already been nosing around, asking sly 
questions and making pointed comments about "nepotism." The election 
wasn't until next year, but the Sheriff had already made up his mind to 
dump him on some other poor, unsuspecting police department before it 
became an issue. They owed him a favor down in Walker County. But then, 
that place was crooked as a dog's hind leg and Donny was stupid enough 
that he'd probably get himself killed the first week.</p>

<p>His sister wouldn't thank him for THAT.</p>

<p>He
let the boat drift for a while, then restarted the engine and very 
slowly chugged upriver out in the middle of the channel, still unsure of
which side the sound had come from, trying to listen over the low 
mutter of the engine. He actually passed Dead Man's Holler on his right 
while Charlie was policing up the ATF bodies at the roadblock. 
Carmichael heard the boat, but thought it was something Charlie was up 
to so he stayed quiet, grinding his teeth in pain. And although the 
Sheriff could see the dock and Charlie's pole sticking out of the 
fixture, brush shielded his view of the hog-tied ATF supervisor. Thus, 
Carmichael's last chance for life passed upstream.</p>

<p>By the time 
the dead man hollered, Sheriff Johnson was passing the second bend above
the old Gordon place and heard not a thing. But he HAD heard SOMETHING.
His intuition borne of long experience with the Feds told him that they
had done something stupid again.</p>

<p>Indeed, they seemed to always 
be doing something stupid. Did they have a test or something that said, 
"Hey, if you're kneejerk stupid, we want you in the ATF"? It seemed like
it. Ever since they'd been reinvigorated by the Gun Control Act of 
1968, they'd been doing deadly stupidities, from the Kenyon Ballew 
shooting to Waco to Sipsey Street.</p>

<p>And that last was pure-dee 
DUMB. He knew Phil Gordon well. He grew up with him and went to school 
with him, although he was two years older than Phil and graduated 
sooner. Johnson had gone straight into the Marines after graduation, 
Phil went into the Army two years later. Phil was a serious shooter and a
self-effacing southern gentleman, a devout Christian and good family 
man who'd raised a passel of accomplished kids. If he had a vice it was 
running his mouth about injustice and government excesses, which was why
the ATF had targeted him, probably.</p>

<p>But whatever their made-up 
excuse, and no matter how many ATF agents he had killed in self-defense,
the folks up here figured that it was the ATF and not Phil Gordon, who 
had it coming. And if now some more ATF agents had gone missing, well, 
wasn't that just too bad? Winston County had a long history of making 
"authorities" like Confederate Home Guards and conscription officers, as
well as a hundred and forty years of state and federal liquor and tax 
revenue agents, disappear. That four more were now missing was seen by 
Winston Countians, after the death of someone they knew and respected, 
as merely the latest episode in the region's proud, independent saga. 
Feds were SUPPOSED to disappear up here, didn't THEY know THAT? And if 
the perpretrators were not caught, then that was OK with most of the 
voters too.</p>

<p>One other thing. Sheriff Carter Johnson knew that if 
he was seen by the voters as a tool of the Feds and not the local 
standard bearer of law enforcement, he didn't have a hope in hell of 
getting re-elected. Skeeter Haynes would see to that.</p>

<p>So those 
were the horns of his dilemma, now made worse by the thought that with 
that burst of submachinegun fire, some more ATF agents may have just 
been disappeared, or killed, or whatever. Or maybe they'd get lucky, bag
their trophy, and leave the county, and more importantly, leave Sheriff
Carter Johnson the hell alone. Of course, if they killed somebody that 
the local folks deemed innocent, like Phil Gordon, the resentments would
wash over him because he hadn't protected them long enough to get a 
fair trial. As if there was anything such like in the federal court 
system these days. And the Feds had already proven they didn't trust him
enough to consult him about anything, so what could he do? In any case,
his life was about to get a lot more miserable.</p>

<p>As a result, the Sheriff finished what he had set out to do that morning.</p>

<p>He fished.</p>

<p>He
tried not to worry about missing ATF agents and submachinegun fire in 
the forest and pondered over how to get rid of his nephew without 
getting him killed. As if to deliberately compound his frustration, the 
fish refused to bite. Maybe if Skeeter Haynes wants my job, I should pay
him back by letting him have it.</p>

<p>A poor bastard he'd be then.</p>

<p>Just like me.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Tell
me that again, slowly," Will Shipman ordered Jimmy Flynn. They were 
sitting alone in Will Shipman's kitchen, sharing coffee and secrets. It 
was the night of the skirmish at the old Gordon cabin.</p>

<p>So Jimmy 
did, slowly. The Suburban passing him, US government plates, packed with
stone-faced men in combat gear, the automatic weapons fire, the booms, 
the whiff of tear gas as he and Katy had driven home past the entrance 
to the old Gordon place on the way home. And oh, yeah, could Will 
believe it? He, Jimmy Flynn, was getting married.</p>

<p>That part was 
easy. His wife had told him to expect it four months ago. Women were 
wise in the way of such things, while most men like Jimmy (and me, 
thought Will wistfully) were merely targets on female radar screens, 
ready to be brought down by charm, feminine wiles and pheremones.</p>

<p>But
if another bunch of ATF had truly met misfortune in the Bankhead, this 
county was about to be torn apart, and the Feds were likely going to 
come looking for yours truly, Will knew. He had made no secret of his 
opinions of the innocence of Phil Gordon and the guilt of the ATF for 
the Battle of Sipsey Street. And some folks even knew about his militia 
activities. This was not good. He had to first verify that something had
actually happened, without raising suspicions, of course. In addition, 
he knew he had to figure out quickly who was responsible for taking on 
and apparently defeating two ATF teams. He had a guess, but it didn't 
seem possible. The man he suspected didn't even own a firearm.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
morning after Sheriff Johnson's fishing trip, the ATF was confirming, 
in a backhanded sort of way by asking about them, that some more of 
their agents had come up missing. It was six this time. The regional 
office in Nashville called, wanting to know if there was another 
Suburban behind his office. There wasn't. But there were more details 
about this team's mission than there had been the last time. They'd had 
only one destination -- Phil Gordon's old cabin on the lake -- which was
right close by where the Sheriff heard the shots yesterday. The Sheriff
knew who lived there, and like Will Shipman, he couldn't believe it 
either.</p>

<p>But before Sheriff Johnson set out to find Charlie 
Quintard, he had to very carefully consider whether he really wanted to 
find him. He knew that the ATF, who had undercover agents crawling all 
over Double Springs (they stuck out like sore thumbs), wouldn't stop 
until they found their men and the killer or killers. What he was trying
to determine was, did he want to help them or hinder them? Which would 
get him re-elected? If, that is, he wanted to be re-elected at all in 
this brave new world gone mad.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For
his part, Charlie Quintard had been a very busy man since he buried 
Pushmataha. He'd policed up all the ATF's firearms and equipment (he had
quite a gun collection by now, what with the meth heads and the Feds 
leaving things lying around on the ground) and stashed them in two 55 
gallon drums off of Phil Gordon's property out in the Bankhead National 
Forest in a little cave he had found a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>He'd 
also done his best to clean up the forensic detritus of the skirmish, 
picking up brass, wiping out the Suburban's tire tracks and covering 
over torn up undergrowth with mud and camouflage vegetation of various 
kinds. He even repaired, for the second time, the lock on his door. It 
was not going to be enough, he knew. For one thing, it was impossible to
find all the brass in the thick undergrowth. If somebody came out here 
with a metal detector they were bound to find what he couldn't.</p>

<p>It
was time to leave the Gordon cabin. He hated it, but he knew he had no 
choice. It was going to be back to the woods like his ancestors and his 
life was going to be a lot rougher. But in order to do it, he needed 
help moving his larder.</p>

<p>Now, before the place flooded with Feds.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"I've
gotta get me some more deputies," Barton Meigs murmured to himself in 
his Nashville office, bitterly recalling the line of Brian Dennehy's 
crooked sheriff in Silverado. No shit. First the wholesale slaughter of 
more than a hundred agents in the Battle of Sipsey Street, then four, 
followed by six more, missing up in Winston County on a stupid follow up
search. Three more dead (and six wounded) in Cherokee County, Alabama 
on what should have been a piece-of-cake no-knock against a gunshop 
owner for straw-man sales. Only the dickhead decided he wasn't going to 
be arrested that day or any other and went down fighting.</p>

<p>Worse, 
it was done so stupidly that we managed to kill his wife and six year 
old daughter in the collateral damage. Two more agents wounded in a 
similar incident in Pulaski, Tennessee.</p>

<p>"Has the ATF Declared War
on the American People?" read the headline on the editorial in the Wall
Street Journal this morning. The subhead read, "Or Have the American 
People Declared War on the ATF?"</p>

<p>Good questions.</p>

<p>For the 
thousandth time, he cursed his predecessor at this desk. HE was the 
idiot who'd initiated the Phil Gordon investigation because he didn't 
like what the moke was saying about him and the agency. As if we've ever
been popular, Meigs snorted. Well, the dumbshit had started a war and 
the only thing good Barton Meigs could say about him was that Phil 
Gordon had made him pay with his life for his terminal stupidity.</p>

<p>Meigs hoped the Devil was giving his predecessor a personal After Action Review in Hell right now.</p>

<p>The
dirty little secret of the ATF, and indeed of all federal law 
enforcement including the IRS, was on display for anyone who had the 
eyes to see. As big and bad, as omniscient and omnipresent as we pretend
to be in a country this size, we ain't and we'll never be. It was the 
whole Wizard of Oz thing. Most people bought the display, but some folks
didn't. And he could shout, "Pay no attention to the man behind the 
curtain" all he wanted, but it didn't mean he could conjure live agents 
to replace dead ones out of thin air.</p>

<p>If this turns into a war, 
we lose. Unless the military comes in on our side, which Barton Meigs 
figured it wouldn't. The nasty arguments he had with his brother the 
Major General like clockwork every Thanksgiving told him as much.</p>

<p>Worse
than the casualties were the resignations sweeping the agency. Nobody 
wanted to risk getting killed short of retirement, it seemed. There were
rumors of a "national emergency stop loss" order from D.C., but all 
that did was accellerate the exodus. The unions were screaming bloody 
murder too. If the President decided to make this a national "law and 
order" crusade as was the rumor, this was going to get very ugly. Some 
people just don't know when to back off. We did it after Waco, didn't 
we? We managed to save the agency when everybody, including the 
turf-jealous FBI, wanted us gone.</p>

<p>But Clinton, for all the names 
the conservatives called him had in the end been a pragmatic politician,
perhaps because he was just in it for the broads. But this President? 
This guy was a true believer and arrogant to boot. The President, whose 
photo hung behind him on the wall, was just the kind of man to take a 
terrible situation and make it truly horrific.</p>

<p>Meigs looked at an
organization chart for his region that had been adjusted to reflect the
losses since Sipsey Street. There were more holes than filled 
positions, even after the wave of emergency transfers in from all over 
the country. The loss of institutional memory represented by those empty
slots was staggering. Every single outstanding case now in progress or 
in the courts in the southeastern United States had been affected. Real 
criminals, not bumbling gun dealers guilty of paperwork errors or target
shooters guilty of nothing but malfunctioning semi-auto rifles, were 
getting off on dismissed charges. Vicious rapists, drug dealers and 
killers, were walking because we picked on the wrong guy and he fed us 
our own ass.</p>

<p>Meigs had been all through what paper trail remained
on Gordon in ATF files. The guy hadn't been a "terrorist" as the 
national PR spokesmen of his agency were saying. He was just a 
loudmouth. A very talented loudmouth who had two things: tactical 
warning of ATF intentions and nothing to lose. He thought of his 
predecessor and cursed him, again.</p>

<p>You stupid SOB. Burn in Hell.</p>

<p>His secretary broke in on his foul mood. "Sir, Assistant Director Atherton is on line three for you."</p>

<p>Oh, God, what now? He picked up the handset and punched the line button.</p>

<p>"Meigs."</p>

<p>"Meigs, this is AD Atherton."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"I've
just come from a meeting with the Director and the Attorney General. 
The decision has been taken to get you some more help."</p>

<p>"That's good news sir." Meigs paused, "Transfers from the FBI and other agencies?"</p>

<p>"No,
they've got their own demands. We're working on something much bigger 
to deal with this whole problem of domestic gun terrorism."</p>

<p>Uh, oh, thought Meigs, that's a new term. "Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes.
You'll be briefed on that when we've finalized the operational plan, 
but for now I'm sending you a man who can fill up your T.O. &amp; E. 
with operational bodies to make up for your grievous losses."</p>

<p>"Who, sir?"</p>

<p>"John
Claxton of Brightfire. He'll be in Nashville tomorrow morning. It's an 
open-ended contract. Tell him what you need and he'll get it for you. 
They're a very capable firm with a lot of experience. Money is no 
object."</p>

<p>Meigs was silent.</p>

<p>"Meigs," said the AD, "Do you have any questions about this?"</p>

<p>Meigs
decided to risk it. "Sir, I need experienced federal law enforcement 
officers, even inexperienced ones will do in a pinch, but I need agents,
I don't need mercenaries unfamiliar with the way we do things."</p>

<p>The AD was silent for a moment, which Meigs knew to be a bad sign.</p>

<p>"Meigs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"'The way we do things' is about to change. Work with Claxton or find another job."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Meigs heard the click on the other end and set down the handset.</p>

<p>Mercenaries.</p>

<p>Shit and shove me in it.</p>

<p>Mercenaries.</p>

<p>Early retirement was starting to look pretty good after all.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Will Shipman was locking up for the night when a soft tap came at his back door. "Huh?"</p>

<p>His
dogs hadn't barked. That was weird. They usually announced every car 
that passed by down on the road. Will reached on top of the tall shelf 
in the hall leading to the kitchen and retrieved an M1911 .45 pistol. He
racked the slide and eased to the back of the house. The kitchen lights
were already off. He peeked through the curtain at the window over the 
sink and saw someone standing in the soft glow of the back porchlight.</p>

<p>"Charlie?"</p>

<p>Will
safed the weapon, tucked it in his belt behind him Mexican style, moved
to the door and opened it. Sure enough. It was Charlie Quintard.</p>

<p>"Can I come in, Will?" Quintard asked softly through the screen door. "I need to talk to you about somethin'."</p>

<p>"Sure Charlie, come on in," Will said as he pushed the screen door open for Charlie to enter.</p>

<p>"Have
a seat," Will invited, indicating the same kitchen table he'd talked 
with Jimmy Flynn at a few hours before. "Can I get you a cup of coffee, 
or somethin'?"</p>

<p>"No coffee," said Charlie, "but a glass of water would be nice. I've been walkin' for a ways."</p>

<p>"All the way from Phil's place?" That was twenty miles or more, for Will lived clean on the other side of Double Springs.</p>

<p>"Naw,
I hitchhiked most of the way, but after dark I couldn't get any more 
rides so I jest walked. It's been a long day." The weariness in Charlie 
Quintard's voice was evident.</p>

<p>Will got him a glass and the 
pitcher of water Mary kept in the fridge and poured Charlie a drink. He 
left the pitcher on the table and sat down across from the Indian, 
waiting in silence while Charlie slaked his thirst.</p>

<p>"How can I help you, Charlie?" he asked after Quintard emptied the glass, worried about the answer he might get.</p>

<p>When Charlie finished telling him almost an hour later, Will Shipman realized that he hadn't been worried enough.</p>

<p>But first Will had a question: "Why me?"</p>

<p>"'We
always knew that someday we were going to have to draw the line. Phil 
Gordon drew it and the Feds stepped over it. It's time to shove back.'"</p>

<p>Will
was smart enough to know when his own words were being quoted back to 
him. Even so, he was darn sure that Charlie hadn't been there when he 
said them at the first muster of the Free State Constitutional Militia 
after the Battle of Sipsey Street.</p>

<p>Or had he?</p>

<p>"How...?"</p>

<p>Charlie
smiled. "Will, I've been practicin' my stalkin' skills fer years in the
Bankhead and up in the Sipsey. You think I couldn't sneak up on a bunch
of newly minted militiamen?"</p>

<p>When he thought back on it later, 
Will Shipman recalled that he thought someone was watching him and his 
recruits from the woods that day, but he'd put it down to the ghosts of 
Winston County. But just now, he said, "Well, I reckon you did."</p>

<p>"You know when you swore all those boys into your new militia?"</p>

<p>Will nodded.</p>

<p>"Well,
I joined too. I repeated your oath, I jest didn't make myself known." 
Charlie Quintard paused. "In all my life," he went on, "no one ever 
treated me as fairly or as kindly as Phil Gordon. I learned more about 
truth an' honor an' principle from him than I did my own daddy. He was 
as decent a human being as I ever knew an' if the ATF killed him, it 
wasn't because of anything he deserved to get. Since then, I've had two 
encounters with those godless heathens. They're thieves, murderers and 
dog-killers. Whatever Phil gave them, they deserved it. An' I know the 
ones that I got deserved it too."</p>

<p>When he talked of Phil Gordon, 
Charlie's face was soft. When he finished talking about the ATF his 
flinty visage looked like iron beaten in a forge.</p>

<p>Something occured to Will. "Thieves? What did they steal?"</p>

<p>Charlie had left that part out. He told Will about Carmichael and the medicine bag and Henderson and the hunting knife.</p>

<p>When Charlie got to the part about Henderson, Will blurted out, "You did WHAT?"</p>

<p>"I
said," Charlie explained patiently, "I put his hand in a vise an' threw
him in after his dead buddies. My granddaddy did that to a Oxnard who 
stole his mule back in the Thirties. He got the mule back at gunpoint 
an' took the thief to our family's water-powered forge down by the old 
river bed -- this was before the dam backed up the lake. Anyway he had 
an old vise he wasn't using an' after he tied the man's hands together 
he put his right hand in the vise an' crushed it tight. The Oxnard's 
always were no account, he said, an' his cousin was the Sheriff back 
then so turnin' him in was a waste of time. An' then he tossed him in 
the river and tole him to swim. Went down like a boat anchor." Charlie 
paused.</p>

<p>"So did Henderson, screamin' an' hollerin'. He'd been 
bragging to his buddies while they tore my place apart about how he'd 
been there when they killed Phil Gordon. I figured he had it comin' 
after I saw him steal my knife. I asked granddaddy once before he died 
why he didn't he just hang Oxnard like most folks did horsethieves, an' 
he tole me, 'I didn't have a long enough rope an' he wasn't worth the 
powder.'"</p>

<p>Charlie paused, half-smiling. "I guess that's what 
happened to me the second time. I didn't have another vise for 
Carmichael so I jest strapped him in the Suburban. Like my granddaddy, I
used what I had. Improvise, adapt an' overcome."</p>

<p>Will thought 
about that for a while, as Charlie emptied the water pitcher and waited.
He did not want Charlie for an enemy, that was for sure and certain. 
But he was going to be a dangerous friend too. He could see that 
plainly. Not for so much as anything Charlie might do to him, but more 
for what Charlie's enemies might do to them both. And he saw that 
Charlie's enemies, who had been Phil Gordon's enemies before that, were 
his enemies now too.</p>

<p>Well, I talked big for a lot of years about 
"drawin' lines in the dirt" and now that one's been drawn, I can't 
exactly back down, now can I? Not and look myself in the mirror. 
Explaining that to Mary would be another thing. Thank God she was at 
Susie's house helping with the new grandbaby.</p>

<p>But there comes a 
time in every guerrilla's life when he must choose between fire and 
maneuver and escape and evade. For now he would help Charlie escape and 
evade, because he knew he would need him when it came time to fire and 
maneuver. Charlie Quintard could also help train his people to become 
stalkers and killers. And we're going to need more stalkers and killers 
before this is over.</p>

<p>"Charlie," Will said, "welcome to the Free 
State Constitutional Militia. I accept your enlistment. Now, let's get 
my pickup truck and go move your larder before tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>Charlie smiled, and stood up. "Can I use your restroom, Will? That water went clean through me."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said Will, "first door on the left down the hall."</p>

<p>As he watched the Indian leave the kitchen, Will Shipman shook his head in disbelief.</p>

<p>Puttin' a thief's hand in a VISE and droppin' him in a river.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>I mean, damn.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It
was coming up dawn before they finished moving the larder and both men 
were beyond weary. "I'm too old for this crap, Charlie," Will said at 
one point after they'd humped the last of the five gallon buckets up to 
the cave.</p>

<p>During a break, Charlie had showed him his plunder in 
the two 55 gallon barrels. Will couldn't believe it. What a haul. And 
this was no gun collection that had been purchased over time, nor some 
government shipment gone astray. These were all battle trophies, taken 
in single combat.</p>

<p>Will Shipman had been a soldier and he had killed people in combat. That was one thing.</p>

<p>Charlie, well... Charlie was a warrior. And Will knew the difference.</p>

<p>"Charlie,"
Will said after he'd caught his breath, "I'm going to want your help 
trainin' my people after this blows over. Stalkin', trackin', edged 
weapons, close quarters combat."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Charlie, "I can do that."</p>

<p>"But I want you to learn something too, for me."</p>

<p>"Uh, OK, what?" Charlie was puzzled.</p>

<p>Will
shifted the lid off the first drum and pulled out a weapon he'd seen 
earlier. After pulling the magazine and racking the bolt, he safed the 
weapon and said, "Tell me about this."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that belonged 
to one of them meth heads. It fires real quiet. I know because he tried 
to kill me with it. Couldn't hit the broadside of a barn, though." 
Charlie gave his signature half-grin and then volunteered, "It ain't 
really silent cause it makes a clackin' sound. But it's real quiet 
compared to a regular gun."</p>

<p>"So this can does work," Will 
replied. "You can't really tell by lookin' at 'em, you've got to try it.
There's lots of fake suppressors out there. But I'll take your word for
it." Will shifted the weapon back into the glare of the electric 
lantern they were using.</p>

<p>"Charlie, this is an Ingram MAC-10 
submachinegun. It fires .45 caliber rounds out of a 30-round magazine, 
from an open bolt. This is the selector switch. This is safe, this is 
semi-auto and this is full auto. The feller who was shootin' at you was 
probably using full auto, and he probably didn't use the fold-out stock,
did he?"</p>

<p>"That's just like I picked it up off the ground," Charlie replied. "Had to clean a little blood off it though."</p>

<p>"Well,
the stock folds out like this, see?" Will manipulated the mechanism. 
"And this little strap hanging down from the front you use to pull the 
muzzle down when you fire. Like this." Will mounted the weapon to his 
shoulder and showed Charlie the proper hold and stance, leaning into the
shot with his left foot forward.</p>

<p>"Are you right handed?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"OK, do what I just did and hold it up like you're going to fire at somebody."</p>

<p>Charlie complied, and Will corrected his stance and hold. "More like that, Charlie. Got it?"</p>

<p>"I guess, but I'm a lot better with a bow."</p>

<p>"I know, but sometimes only a firearm will do. You see that don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess, but how do I practice with it up here?"</p>

<p>"How
far back does this cave go, after you get past that big rock?" Will 
flashed his own combat light back into the opening behind them.</p>

<p>"Well,
about, I don't know, twenty-five yards or so. You can stand up in it 
for about ten of those where it gets straight following a fissure in the
layer. If you're thinking of me shootin' back there, I'd rather not."</p>

<p>Will
thought for a moment, about noise and powdersmoke and breathing the 
already fetid air of the cave. Probably wouldn't be good to give away 
his position anyway. Lord knows what technology they were going to bring
to bear to find him up here.</p>

<p>"All right. Look. For now let's 
just say that you learn how to take it apart, clean it and dry-fire it. 
Do you have any more magazines for this?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Charlie 
and rooted around in the barrel, clanking and banging until he pulled 
out an old GI ammo pouch with a shoulder strap containing five other 
thirty rounders. "Here."</p>

<p>Will examined them one at time. Three were loaded. Two were rusty.</p>

<p>"Look,
Charlie, the other thing we're going to have to do is preserve this 
stuff from rusting." Will thought. "But now is not the time."</p>

<p>Daylight was coming fast and the truck had to be out of here. Will put the lid back in place on the drum.</p>

<p>"OK, we've got everything you need right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I can get by on this. But I'm low on candles and matches."</p>

<p>"All
right. Don't under any circumstances go back to the cabin. You know the
cache points we talked about. I'll see that you get some candles and 
some other things you need at the first one by tomorrow night. It's the 
closest and you don't want to be moving around much for a while. I'll 
also get you a means to communicate with me if you need me. Anything 
else?"</p>

<p>"No," said Charlie slowly, "Just thanks."</p>

<p>"Charlie,
I never got a chance to help Phil. I know he'd approve of me helpin' 
you. But what I really think is that we're gonna be helpin' each other 
thru this shitstorm that's about to hit."</p>

<p>Charlie, thinking on the ten dead agents and Pushmataha, asked plaintively, "You mean it ain't hit yet?"</p>

<p>Will, realizing what Charlie had been through, shook his head, "Believe me, we ain't seen nothin' yet."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>"The supplies will be there. Keep safe."</p>

<p>Charlie said, "I will," not really believing "safe" was possible.</p>

<p>Will Shipman turned and disappeared out the mouth of the cave into the coming day.</p>

<p>Charlie
was too exhausted to arrange anything now. He picked out a flat spot on
the cave floor and selected two of his thickest blankets and rolled 
them out. Then he pulled out his sleeping bag and unrolled it over top 
of them. He took off his boots and slipped on some leather mocassins 
he'd made last winter. Then he slipped into the bag, using another 
blanket for a pillow.</p>

<p>His last thought before he drifted off was of how much he missed the faithful Pushmataha.</p>

<p>In his dreams, the dog licked his face, and Charlie smiled.</p>

<h4>4 November: The Grenadier &amp; the Arsenal of Republicanism</h4>

<p>The
workshop was scattered with manuals. Other than the strange smells, 
that was the first thing you noticed. Some were open, face up, others 
face down.</p>

<p>Some had obviously come from the military. There was 
FM 9-13, "Ammunition Handbook", and TM 31-210, "Improvised Munitions 
Handbook". There were even reprints of very old manuals such as "The 
Ordnance Manual for the Use of the Officers of the United States Army, 
Third Edition", dated 1862 and H.L. Scott's "Military Dictionary", first
printed in 1861.</p>

<p>Then there were manuals of civilian provenance, mostly printed by that most notorious of publishing houses, <a href="http://www.paladin-press.com/">Paladin Press</a>. There were titles like "Home Workshop Guns for Defense and Resistance", Truby and Minnery's
two-volume set of "Improvised Modified Firearms", and that staple of 
the '90s citizen militias, Ragnar Benson's "David's Tool Kit: A 
Citizen's Guide to Taking Out Big Brother's Heavy Weapons". On the 
shelves above the work table were classics such as Tenney
Davis's 1943 work, "The Chemistry of Powder and Explosives", Bert 
Levy's "Guerrilla Warfare", Col. John George's "Shots Fired in Anger", von Dach
Bern's "Total Resistance", DuPont's "Blaster's Handbook", and several 
different editions of "Small Arms of the World", interspersed with 
reloading manuals and back issues of <a href="http://www.shotgunnews.com/">Shotgun News</a>.</p>

<p>At
the moment, there were two manuals face up on the work bench - 
"Evaluation of Improvised Shaped Charges" by Anonymous, published in 
1980 by Desert Publications of Cornville, Arizona, and
"Improvised Rifle Grenades" by the aptly named expert, "Powder Burns".</p>

<p>Mark
"Kraut" Mueller was 52 years old, old enough to know better than to 
play around with improvised munitions. The fact that he had quietly 
enjoyed this hobby since 1968 when he first got access to serious 
chemicals after his sophomore science teacher picked him as a lab 
assistant was known to a very few people. The fact that the FBI knew it
as well would not have concerned Mueller very much. He had been very 
careful over the years not to cross the line of criminal conspiracy, and
prior to this day had been more interested in preserving his knowledge 
and ability to build improvised explosive devices than in actually 
making them. It was a skill that he always held back UNTIL.</p>

<p>Well, now "until" had come.</p>

<p>Of that he was certain.</p>

<p>This
was where the design for Phil Gordon's improvised anti-personnel rifle 
grenades had come from. Mark Mueller had know Phil for years. Although 
he couldn't rank him as a friend, they certainly had been friendly. 
Both had fought as allies in the legislative gun control wars in Alabama
over the years. Phil was never shy about what he thought of the ATF,
which is probably why they had come to take him that night.</p>

<p>About a week before the battle, Phil had come to see Kraut at his house.</p>

<p>"I
need to ask a favor," he had begun. It was a big favor, and it involved
a huge leap of faith and trust for Mark Mueller. He had taken it.</p>

<p>Still,
if the Feds knew that he had given Phil his design, they would have 
come for him already. So Phil must have taken that secret to his grave.
 How Phil put it together that he had been working on them was easy, 
Mark now understood:</p>

<p>"Hell, Mark, I've been knowing you for 
fifteen nigh onto twenty years and for half that time you've been 
beating the drum for that damn Alabama Grenadier Society y'all go play 
with dummies at. I just figured that if I hadn't been so damn cautious 
all these years, that might be something I would have done. It don't 
take Sherlock Holmes."</p>

<p>Mark hadn't perfected the anti-tank grenade yet, but he had given Phil the plans for the anti-personnel grenade.</p>

<p>Phil had done the rest himself.</p>

<p>Truth be told, Mark hadn't actually tested a device in almost ten years, after Waco and the gun bans had convinced him that the Clintonistas
were finally going to try to pick up America's guns. Then, as now, 
Mark was the closest thing the Alabama Constitutional Militia had to an 
ordnance officer. He had conducted many discreet training sessions, 
always SHOWING how but never DOING. He had demonstrated everything from
the utility of dummy rifle grenades in training to how to manufacture a
thermite device to take out an M1 Abrams tank. He had worked up a 12 Gauge flechette load that could reliably penetrate an ATF
raid vest of the Nineties at twenty meters and then publicized it so 
that not only would the various citizen's militias know how to make them
but the "gun gestapo" would know that they were more vulnerable than 
before.</p>

<p>Anything that slowed down the people who had started the 
Waco atrocity and made them more cautious was a positive social good as 
far as Kraut Mueller was concerned.</p>

<p>For this and other sins, Mark was not popular with the ATF,
nor did the FBI like him either. Both agencies had tried to entrap him
over the years with a variety of scams and provocations, most of them 
unimaginative if not stupid. Mueller had evaded them all, and for a 
fellow of his political stripe that was saying something.</p>

<p>The 
Feds always had a theory that a gun enthusiast with political opinions 
was just this side of a terrorist, and the Clinton administration made 
sure that their FBI stooges kept close track of militia folk. The irony
that the Fibbies spent so much time spying on the militias that they let the September 11 conspiracy get past them was not lost on Kraut.</p>

<p>What morons.</p>

<p>Most of them weren't
evil characters, of course. They were just federal bureaucrats working
toward retirement. Of course some of them fit Hannah Arendt's definition of the "banality of evil" - Jim Cavanaugh of the ATF,
for one. But for the most part they were guys who joined after a stint
in the military or the local cops and who thought they could do some 
good fighting bad guys. When an administration took over that defined 
bad guys as anybody with a gun who didn't hew to the administration political line - well, the agents weren't in an easy position to say differently. Even if they thought the Clintons were borderline treasonable (and many did), they weren't about to jeopardize their retirement pay.</p>

<p>Oh,
some of them resigned out of principle, but darn few. Mostly they 
turned into the guys who, when ordered to do something patently 
unconstitutional like the Waco raid, saluted and put on their raid gear.
 You know, the same kind of "decent Germans who just followed orders" 
that we hung at Nuremberg for war crimes.</p>

<p>Meet them in a bar, and
you could get to like them. But if they came to your door, you'd 
better be prepared to take their lives. Because they showed at Waco and
Ruby Ridge, and now at the Battle of Sipsey
Street, that they were ready to take yours. Not only that, but they'd 
kill your wife and kids as well and be unapologetic and unrepentant 
afterwards. And as far as Mueller understood, "Waco Rules" were still 
the way the Feds ran things. If Sipsey Street proved anything, it proved
<i>that</i>, even if the Feds had gotten more than they bargained for.</p>

<p>Of course, since that was the way Mark viewed things (and he hadn't
been shy about sharing his opinions with the Feds) no one ever came to 
his door, at least until now. While that might be because the Feds couldn't make a case on him, Mark didn't
think so. They'd framed others before and got away with it. The 
federal prisons were still populated with so-called "militia leaders" of
the Nineties who'd been talked into one piece of tomfoolery or another,
or at least the federal prosecutors had made juries believe that they 
had.</p>

<p>But Kraut was of the opinion that the reason he'd never been
raided was because he had made it plain that Waco Rules were still in 
force and that he would kill as many Feds as he could before he went 
down. No federal prison for Mrs. Mueller's son, that was for sure. 
Kraut knew the Feds could kill him any day they decided it was worth it,
but he'd made it plain to them it had better be worth the chance of 
them not living to collect their retirement. And Kraut knew, as did the
Fibbies, that he had enough friends to collect the butcher's bill if he could not.</p>

<p>So far, his own private policy of "mutual assured destruction" had kept him alive.</p>

<p>So far.</p>

<p>But after Sipsey Street, Mark Mueller was sure, the dynamic had changed. The gloves were off now.</p>

<p>Phil Gordon's spectacular resistance had changed everything.</p>

<p>The work shop was in the windowless basement of a business establishment owned by a good friend, a fellow who wasn't
associated with the militia in any public way. In fact, there were 
perhaps three people in the whole world who knew of the workshop's 
existence. There was only one access door to the stairs from the 
inside, and it was both steel and triple locked. You could only get to 
the door by passing through the private office of the owner, which, 
because he handled lots of cash in an average business day, was equally 
secured with alarms, steel doors, controlled access and bulletproof 
windows.</p>

<p>In fact, the building had been constructed just four 
years ago with just this dual-purpose in mind. The hard-working owner 
was one of the few patriots Mark knew who had money to burn, for most of
the other militiamen and women were poor as church mice. In the shop, 
Mueller could feel as secure from prying eyes as in one of the unit's 
supply dump caves up in Blount, St. Clair or Winston counties. And that was good, because you didn't need to be nervous when playing around with improvised explosive devices, particularly the kind Kraut was about to fabricate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rifle
grenades are the Marine rifleman's best weapons for use against tanks, 
pill boxes and, in some cases, enemy personnel. They are also effective
as signaling agents, for screening effect, and as an incendiary against
inflammable targets. They are similar to hand grenades, but have 
greater range since they are fired from the muzzle of the rifle by use 
of a special blank cartridge. Certain types are much more powerful than
hand grenades... Rifle grenades are versatile weapons and can perform 
many jobs if the right grenade is used for the particular task at hand. 
They may be fired singly or in groups, at low or high angle, and they 
can cover the dead space between the distance you can throw a hand 
grenade and the minimum range of mortar and artillery fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or so said the"Guidebook for Marines", May 1966 edition, anyway.</p>

<p>In
any case, for his purposes, Kraut was already sold on the military 
utility of rifle grenades. It helped that he and his friends really had
few other choices.</p>

<p>By the turn of the 21st Century, rifle grenades were considered pass&eacute;
by just about every military establishment on the planet, except 
Israel. The United States Army had dropped them from the inventory 
toward the end of the Vietnam War in favor of a 40mm grenade launcher, 
first the M79, then the M203. The M203, slung on the underside of an 
M16 series rifle, was still standard issue and Mark's son Mike, a clerk 
in the 101st Airborne Division's headquarters had used one in Iraq on 
convoy duty. At ranges farther than the M203, the Army used mortars, 
anti-armor rockets, artillery or direct-fire cannon to suppress their 
enemies' fire.</p>

<p>However, the militia had no mortars, anti-armor 
rockets, artillery or direct-fire cannon. These were forbidden to them 
by federal law as "destructive devices." Nor could any of those weapons 
they be easily fabricated by small workshops like the one Mueller was 
sitting in.</p>

<p>But what the militia did have a lot of were rifles-- 
bolt action and semiautomatic rifles. And some of those rifles had 
military spec flash hiders on them that doubled as rifle grenade 
launchers.</p>

<p>There were rifles chambered in 7.62 NATO (called .308 or three-oh-eight by civilians) like the Spanish FR-8, the Belgian FAL, the German Heckler &amp; Koch HK91 and the French MAS 49-56. There was also a variant of the Soviet SKS
rifle chambered in 7.62x39 made by the Yugoslavians that was set up for
launching NATO specification rifle grenades, courtesy of Tito's little 
falling out with Stalin. At the moment, these were selling for less 
than $200.00 each.</p>

<p>Both the SKS and the MAS 49-56 had the advantage of having integral grenade sights.</p>

<p>There were also rifles that could be fitted with grenade launching attachments like the venerable Springfield 1903 and the M1 Garand of WWII issue - both chambered in .30-06 - or the civilian semiautomatic version of the US M14 rifle chambered in 7.62 NATO.</p>

<p>So there were plenty of grenade-launching platforms in militia hands.</p>

<p>It
was also legal to own such a rifle (for the moment anyway) and you 
could go out to a range, a pasture or an old strip mine and launch 
grenades, as long as they were inert practice grenades.</p>

<p>"The beauty of the rifle grenade," wrote one military advocate on the Internet, "is
you can train on them anywhere there is an open space to shoot. You 
simply take practice rifle grenades and launch them with low-cost blanks
at your targets to perfect your aim. After shooting them, you go down 
range, pick them up and shoot them again. And again. 'Practice makes 
perfect' is the by-word for a can-do generation that doesn't wear 
t-shirts with slacker mottoes like 'If you can't win don't try.' 
Perfect aim allows you to hit bad guys in moving cars when the chips are
down and lives are on the line."</p>

<p>The grenades were projected 
from the rifle by means of a special grenade launching blank, and 
Mueller's militia unit had been manufacturing such blanks for years, 
using a special star crimp die that had cost more money than Kraut 
cared to remember.</p>

<p>Mark had the charge data for 7.62 NATO grenade blank taken from the 7th edition of Cartridges of the World posted above his reloading table across the room. In bold black letters it read:</p>

<p>For the M64 Grenade Launching Blank (7.62mm NATO):<br/>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/trainingprojectile.jpg" alt="The M-31 Training Rifle Grenade" width='400' height='202'/><br/>
<b>The M-31 Training Rifle Grenade</b></p>

<p>Until
recently, US military practice grenades like the M-31 were available to
purchase from surplus outlets like Rock Island Armory of Geneseo,
Illinois, although the prices had gone up over the past decade from 
about $5.00 each to $25.00 and up and up. Part of the problem was that 
the M31, painted blue like most US training munitions, was made of sheetmetal
and the fins were prone to tear off after just one use. Even if you 
had the means to rebuild the fins, by the second or third use the 
warhead would break away from the launching body tube and all you'd be 
left with was a pile of junk.</p>

<p>That was if you could find it. The grenades got lost as often as not unless you tied a three foot long piece of fluorescent
engineer's tape to the tail and stationed a spotter out in the impact 
zone. So between militia training usage and the fact that no M31s had 
been made since the Sixties, that well was about dry. They were still 
available if you looked real hard, but the price was exorbitant.</p>

<p>This
was unfortunate for improvised munitioneers like Kraut because the M31 
lent itself to reactivation, especially because the shape and 
composition of the training round was perfect for the shaped charge 
necessary to be an effective antitank round. Powder Burns' book, 
"Improvised Rifle Grenades", was a tutorial on rearming an M31 with a 
shaped charge of home-made C4.</p>

<p>The shaped charge principle had 
first been discovered in 1888 by Charles Edward Munroe, a professor of 
chemistry at the U.S. Naval Academy. While working at the Naval Torpedo
Station at Newport, Munroe found that that if a block of guncotton with
letters countersunk into its surface is detonated with the lettered 
surface against a steel plate, the letters are indented into the surface
of the steel. Likewise, if the letters are raised above the surface of
the guncotton, by detonation they are reproduced in relief on the steel
plate, embossed and raised above the neighboring surface.</p>

<p>In 
other words, the greatest effects are produced on the steel plate at the
points where the explosive material stands away from it, at precisely 
where explosive waves from different directions meet and reinforce each 
other. Munroe found that by increasing the depth of the concavity in 
the explosive he was able to produce greater and greater effects on the 
plate until with a charge which was hollowed out all the way, he was 
able to punch a hole completely through the steel plate.</p>

<p>Later 
ordnance scientists would learn that the effects of the shaped charge 
was independent of velocity - that is, it was unimportant if the charge 
was laid next to the steel plate or fired into it at great speed. The 
important thing was that for any given size and shape of charge, there 
was an optimal point above the steel plate (called the stand-off) where 
the effects of charge were maximized.</p>

<p>In addition, it was 
critical to locate the detonator at the center of the rear of the 
charge, so as to focus the resulting explosion. Finally, the conical 
cavity at the front of the charge must, for maximum effect, be lined 
with a ductile metal like copper. When the explosive is detonated the 
liner is deformed into a high velocity molten metal jet which is capable
of penetrating armor plate.</p>

<p>Minor changes in any of these three 
factors: stand-off, detonation point and liner make a great difference 
in the ability of a given charge to penetrate modern armor plate. While
an unlined shaped charge would work, it was far less efficient for 
antitank work than a similar lined charge.</p>

<p>Phil Gordon's improvised rounds had been unlined.</p>

<p>Mark intended to line his.</p>

<p>Mueller
studied the tables in "Evaluation of Improvised Shaped Charges", then 
put his micrometer on the sheets of copper, alloy and aluminum that he 
had been able to scrounge at the industrial surplus supply store on 41st
Street in Birmingham. Mark jotted the measurements down in his 
journal. He would use all three in the prototypes to see which worked 
best.</p>

<p>Weight was also a critical consideration. Kraut had come 
to the conclusion that the M31 was going to be best for antitank 
purposes. But if the larger goal of a "universal fed discourager" was 
to be met, he would have to find a design that could be produced by 
anybody from the stocks at their local hardware or building supply 
store.</p>

<p>Kraut had about 500 inert M31s, new in the cardboard 
shipping tubes, stashed in a friend's barn up in Blount County, courtesy
of a trade he'd made ten years ago with an itinerant surplus dealer. 
"Shorty" Long had bought them for scrap price from the property disposal
office at Anniston Army Depot sometime in the misty past and needed to 
get rid of them because he'd lost his storage area due to divorce.</p>

<p>His
ex-wife got the kids, the furniture, the car and the house, he got the 
military surplus, the alimony, the child support and their three 
legged-dog. In retrospect, there was no doubt that his ex-wife, as 
ex-wives often do, got the better part of the deal. Still, Shorty clung
to the comforting thought that the three-legged dog, which of course 
was named "Lucky", had a sweeter disposition than his ex-wife.</p>

<p>"Even if they were both bitches," he told Mark.</p>

<p>But just as the supply of M31s had pretty much run out, the Israelis came to the rescue. Earlier that year, <a href="http://www.e-gunparts.com/">Numrich Gun Parts Corporation</a>
of West Hurley, New York started advertising a new lot of Israeli 
Practice Grenade Sets for $140.00 each in gun industry magazines like 
Shotgun News.</p>

<p>The set contained six inert rifle grenade 
assemblies with rubber warheads patterned after the Israeli Military 
Industries BT/AT-44 dual purpose rifle grenade. These dummy grenades 
came with removable launching body tubes and tail fin assemblies so that
if one piece were damaged in training, it could be repaired with a new 
part.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the beautiful thing about these Israeli 
grenades. The beautiful thing was that in addition to the six complete 
assemblies, the white wooden crate that Numrich shipped to you held 40 
extra plastic fins and 32 launching body tubes.</p>

<p>And it was the launching tubes and fin assemblies that Kraut coveted.</p>

<p>Improvising
a warhead, whether it is anti-personnel or anti-tank in design, is one 
thing. Mueller was already pretty good at that. But what was beyond 
Mark's abilities was a low-tech way to duplicate the intricacy of the 
fin assembly and the stout metallurgy and critical tolerances of the 
launching body tube. What the Israelis (through the good offices of 
Numrich Gun Parts Corporation) had provided was six training grenades 
and the makings of thirty-two more improvised rifle grenades. And Kraut
figured that really was worth $140.00. Not to mention the fact that 
the six rubber dummy grenades were so stoutly designed and built that 
they hardly ever tore up in routine training. Compared to the M31 
sheetmetal dummies, the Israeli rubber grenades were indestructible.</p>

<p>Six
months ago, when he first understood the potential of the Israeli kits,
Mueller tapped his friends for enough money to buy ten of them. In the
intervening weeks, Kraut had figured out how to adapt the fin and 
launching tube assemblies to common pipe fittings which enabled him to 
adapt them to any kind of warhead he could design. What he was doing 
now was putting all the elements together, including the explosive 
charges, into test prototypes.</p>

<p>By doing so, he was violating 
federal law. But the prototypes were merely to test the theory that 
effective rifle grenade warheads, both antipersonnel and antitank, could
be manufactured in basement workshops. Kraut had no intention of 
mass-producing warheads at this point, even though he had the means to 
do so. He knew that with the help of a dozen militia members, he could 
arm all 500 of his M31s and 300+ of the Israeli hybrids in a week when 
and if he had to.</p>

<p>Now he merely wanted to test the designs so 
that, once proven, his manufacturing instructions could be circulated 
within the militia movement, much like his design for the 12 Gauge 
flechette load.</p>

<p>But after Sipsey Street this was no longer about 
trying to maintain credible deterrence. War, if it was not already 
here, was coming fast. That was what brought Kraut Mueller to this work
bench.</p>

<p>The first problem was that the Israeli tubes were open at
both ends, so the business end would have to be plugged. No problem 
there. Mark went to his local Lowes building supply store and found 
copper 1&quot; pipe caps that with a bit of tapping with a large ball peen 
hammer could be driven down into the open end of the launching tube, 
swedged tight. Of course the friction fit would not hold against the 
overpressure on the inside of the tube upon launching, but Mueller had 
an idea about that too.</p>

<p>The second problem had been the threads 
on the Israeli launching tubes. Mark could find nothing locally to 
match them. They were about 1&quot; O.D. so after perusing some plumbing 
industry websites he came up with a female to male adapter, the female 
end being smooth (designed for sweating onto copper pipe). The male end
was 1&quot; pipe thread making it easy to adapt whatever optimally sized 
warhead he might construct. The problem was with the sample he bought 
from Home Depot. While the smooth inner surface of the female end of 
the copper fitting would slide over the threaded end of the Israeli 
tube, it was loose and there was no way to self-thread the alloy tube 
into the fitting. That had been easy to fix. Mark found some thin 
aluminum shim material, bent it into round and slipped it over the tube 
before he tapped the female end of the fitting into place.</p>

<p>To 
solve the problem of holding both the cap and the fitting in place on 
the tube, Kraut drilled a 1/4&quot; hole through the fitting, tube and cap 
and ran a bolt through the assembly, topping it with a locknut on the 
other side. Thus secured, the tube and cap would hold up to the 
stresses of firing. He had already tested that theory with a dummy 
warhead made out of 1-1/2&quot; PVC pipe with a playdough filler. Fired off
of a Chinese-clone M14S retrofitted with a USGI flash suppressor and an
M76 launching attachment, the grenade had sailed almost 300 meters, 
landing nose down.</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>Mark now knew he had a 
projectile suitable for antipersonnel rounds, at least, and maybe 
antitank rounds as well. That was what he working on now. The 
base-detonating fuse arrangement was a proven type designed by a couple 
of East Texas militiamen back in the Nineties who had a flair for 
technical design. One of the two was tall and lanky, the other shorter 
and more compactly built, so Kraut had dubbed them "Mutt and Jeff."</p>

<p>The
problem with all fuses is how to construct them so that they will be 
robust enough to stand up under the stresses of launch, yet sensitive 
enough to detonate their cargo on the other end. After studying many 
types of artillery fuses from the Civil War to the Nineties, the Texas 
boys had devised a mechanism small enough to fit in a projectile, robust
enough to be safe to launch, and reliable enough to work on impact-- 
and all of the components were available at your local hardware store.</p>

<p>Their
original design had been mated to an black powder burster/antipersonnel
charge launched by twelve gauge shotgun using the old 
blank-shotgun-shell-and-broomstick arrangement first outlined in Che 
Guevara's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guerilla-Warfare-Che-Guevara/dp/0803270100/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1215314605&amp;sr=8-3"><i>Guerrilla Warfare</i></a>.
 Mark had been impressed when Mutt and Jeff had demonstrated it for him
back in 1997 when he made a trip out to the Lone Star state. What 
really impressed him was not the reliable fuse, but the guts of the men 
who put the shotgun to their shoulders and touched off the infernal 
contraption.</p>

<p>Whenever Kraut tested a rifle grenade or rifle 
grenade launching platform, he lashed the rifle to an old tire and used a
very, very long lanyard to touch it off. This procedure had saved 
Mark's life more than once. That Mutt and Jeff did not do this said 
something about either their cojones or their sanity, Mark wasn't sure 
which.</p>

<p>Mueller was now taking their design a step further by 
working it into the highest efficiency rifle-launched projectile able to
be constructed by a basement workshop. First came the antipersonnel 
round. For this warhead, designed to throw shrapnel in every direction,
it was better to move the fuse point of detonation into the center, 
rather than the base. Based on tests of varying size and weight, Mark 
had already calculated the best throw weight for the grenade. With this
knowledge in hand, he found components which when assembled would match
the optimum weight. Schedule 40 or Schedule 80 PVC was fine for a 
casing, light but reasonably strong.</p>

<p>Kraut had worked up a jig to
hold an electric drill with the chuck extending above the table top of 
the work bench at a 90 degree angle. Into the drill chuck, he inserted 
an adjustable cup that would hold the PVC pipe and adapter base (already
glued together using PVC cement). As the drill rotated the PVC 
warhead, Mark squeezed in glue until it was covering the inner wall 
completely with a thin layer. Then he would insert steel ball bearings,
small nails, or some of the flechettes he had left over from the 
anti-ATF shotgun shell project. The centrifugal force of the rotating 
casing distributed the projectiles along the casing wall. Then in went 
more glue and more projectiles, always leaving room for the fuse 
mechanism and explosive charge. He had done this years before when 
working on improvised hand grenades, testing them inside a railroad 
culvert lined with plywood-backed poster board so he had been able to 
analyze the blast patterns. Steel ball bearings seemed to throw the 
most consistent pattern, regardless of whether he used black powder, 
aluminum flash powder or improvised C4 as a burster.</p>

<p>Over the 
past ten days, Mark had completed all of the design work and 
prefabrication of components necessary to make 2 grenades of each type 
he wished to test. There were antitank grenades of differing sizes and 
liners, 3 on the M31 platform (each with a different composition liner) 
and 9 different Israelis, antipersonnel and antitank.</p>

<p>What the 
militia ordnance man was doing now was the assembling of the final 
product, including loading in the C4 and arming the East Texas 
detonators. He worked slowly and carefully, stopping often to get up 
and stretch. He was sweating despite the coolness of the basement and 
every so often would mop his face with an old dish towel.</p>

<p>Eight 
and a half hours after he began, the last of the improvised rifle 
grenades was nestled in its cardboard shipping tube, six tubes to a 
backpack. The backpacks were made of Realtree camouflage pattern of the
type some hunters use, and Kraut had picked them for a steal when the 
local Service Merchandise had gone out of business years ago. Mueller 
was always bringing odd items home, stuff that had no apparent earthly 
purpose as far as his wife could see and no virtue other than it was 
dirt cheap.</p>

<p>Millie had long ago ceased asking, figuring that 
there were other husbands with stranger hobbies and worse vices. And 
while she agreed with Kraut's politics (she was from Arkansas after all,
and no one had despised Clinton more then she), Mueller figured he 
probably wouldn't tell her <i>EVERYTHING</i> about
what he had been up to this day. Ignorance may not be bliss, but it 
sure can be functional occasionally in a marriage. Especially when your
husband was up to what Kraut was up to. Mueller smiled, and wiped the 
sweat from his face and hands once more.</p>

<p>There were other 
projects he was working on, of course. The improvised rifle grenade 
project he had dubbed "Project R". It was the first to come to fruition
because it was the easiest to accomplish. His friend Bob was working 
on a related project, dubbed "P," in a remote farm machine shop in 
Shelby County. Because it also involved shaped charges, most of what 
Kraut learned with P would be applied to R. Bob was working on the 
launcher even now and he did not need the warhead to accomplish that. 
When both R and P were finished, they would devote all their energies to
the most ambitious of their plans, "Project M."</p>

<h4>7 November: Panzerfaust</h4>

<p>"Show me what you've got," said Kraut.</p>

<p>Bob
Smith smiled craftily, his dark eyes glittering, showing some of his 
Korean ancestry, and he flipped back the lid of the long, surplus 
Israeli rocket crate that rested on the folding table in the farm shop.</p>

<p>"OK,"
he began by pulling the smaller of the three tubes out of the crate, 
"this is the original <i>Panzerfaust</i> 100 we got from Mike when he was in 
Germany. I still can't believe you can buy this stuff at flea markets 
over there," he said shaking his head. "Yeah, I know it doesn't have a 
warhead, but STILL..." His voice trailed off, then he continued.</p>

<p>"I'm going to recap a little because it bears on some of the changes I made in the design. As you know we chose the <i>Panzerfaust</i>
because it doesn't require the complex chemistry and safety issues 
involved in making rocket fuel like the bazooka, just black powder as a 
propellant. Because of that, of course, the tube must be much stronger.
 The 100 was a step above the older, smaller <i>Panzerfausts</i>,
with a new firing tube with a two-stage propellant charge that weighed 
190 grams or 6.7 oz. This gave it a projectile speed of about 60 meters
per second, that's about 200 feet per second and a range of 100 meters,
hence the designation. The 100 was pretty much the last <i>Panzerfaust</i>
that made it into the hands of troops in any numbers, showing up first 
about the time of the Battle of the Bulge. The tube length on this 
specimen is 110 cm, which strangely splits the difference between the 
two lengths I've found in the books. It's got a tube diameter of 60 mm 
just like our early bazooka. That's 2.36 inches. With the original 
projectile this weapon weighed about 7 kilos, or between 15 to 16 
pounds. You can see the sights are creviced for ranges of 30, 60, 80 
and 150 meters and those flakes are what's left of the glow-paint night 
sights. That last 150 meter notch is real optimistic even with 7 ounces
of blackpowder throwing it. Here you can see the arming and firing 
system with the lever that also serves as the rear sight. This was an 
improvement over the earlier <i>Panzerfausts.</i>"</p>

<p>Laying
down the original German tube and extracting the second one from the 
case, he placed it beside the first. Smith continued. "Now here is our
direct replica of the original sample."</p>

<p>"Wow," Kraut Mueller burst out, "They're identical!"</p>

<p>"Not quite," demurred Smith.</p>

<p>"You
can see the differences here," he pointed, "here, and here. But all in
all they are perfect to sell to World War II Wehrmacht and Waffen SS 
re-enactors along with an originally-shaped blunt hardwood projectile 
painted to look like metal. The projectile's inert and they're black 
powder, so they're not covered under any of the Feds crappy laws, yet. 
Until the ATF decides to shut down that hobby, we can sell them all day 
long and plow the profits back into making these."</p>

<img src="images//pzf150wproj.jpg" alt="Panzerfaust 150 m" width='400' height='149'/></p>

<p>Bob Smith reached into the case and pulled out the last tube.</p>

<p>"OK, this is a hybrid of what I learned by studying the <i>Panzerfaust</i>
100 and the documents that you gave me from the War Department ordnance
studies done after World War II. Basically, its a combination of 
features from the <i>Panzerfaust</i> 
150 and 250 (which never got fielded) with the same tube as the 100, but
reinforced with bands of steel strapping here, here, here, and here. 
These reinforcements ought to make the thing reusable for at least ten 
shots. Like the original 150, we can increase the length of the 
projectile and the amount of black powder increments to give you more 
efficient flight, speed and accuracy than the original along with a much
heavier charge which will punch more armor. You will also note that we
have replaced the cumbersome and hard to duplicate arming and firing 
system with the RPG style firing handle that the Germans finally got 
around to putting on the <i>Panzerfaust</i> 250."</p>

<p style='text-align:center'><img src="images/pzfvs.jpg" alt='Panzerfaust 250' width='267' height='174'/></p>

<p>When
Bob halted his spiel to take a breath, Mark asked the younger man, "Why
the reinforcements? Why not use a bigger tube? Seems like the 
reinforcements add to production time and cost."</p>

<p>Nodding, Smith 
answered, "We thought of that, but we couldn't lay our hands on seamless
steel tubing of the proper dimensions. We also wanted to maintain a 
heavy projectile throw weight."</p>

<p style='text-align: center'><img src="images/pzfproj.jpg" alt="Panzerfaust Projectile" width='231' height='162'/></p>

<p>"How heavy is that?" Mark asked.</p>

<p>Bob told him.</p>

<p>"Damn! That's good!"</p>

<p>"Yeah,
its a couple orders of magnitude better than what we can get with a 
rifle grenade thrown by an itty-bitty 7.62 NATO grenade blank."</p>

<p>Kraut Mueller's brain swam with the possibilities.</p>

<p>Bob
Smith reached behind the box and pulled out a shorter but fatter 
object. "And here's a sample projectile we turned out with round bar 
stock, sheet metal and some hardware. You can see the cavity in the 
base for the secondary 'booster' charge of black powder, and the 
fabrication process facilitates loading the warhead."</p>

<p>He pulled 
off the hollow warhead shell with a simple twist. "All you've got to do
is design a projectile that works, Herr Dok-tor."</p>

<p>They looked at each other and both burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Ya
done good, Bob," Mark Mueller said appreciatively. "When I had this 
hare-brained idea I didn't know if it would work or not. I mean the 
black powder solved the rocket fuel questions, but, darn, you really did
it well."</p>

<p>Bob Smith continued to grin, "Well, if it doesn't work, you can take it out of my pay."</p>

<p>The machine shop rang with their laughter.</p>

<p>"Now all we gotta do," said Kraut Mueller as they both exited the shop, "is test the things."</p>

<p>"I'll let you shoot it first," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Reluctantly," he added.</p>

<p>"Thanks a bunch, Smith."</p>

<p>Kraut paused, still laughing.</p>

<p>"Thanks a whole bunch."</p>

<h4>18 November: "Hide yer Wimmin, Clinton's in Town!"</h4>

<p><b><i>FBI - Office of the Special Agent in Charge<br/>
Birmingham, AL<br>2:47 P.M Central Standard Time.</i></b></p>

<p>"So
what you're saying is this militia guy has operational rifle grenades 
and anti-tank weapons and despite constant surveillance which he's 
slipped past at least three times we can't figure out where he's hiding 
them? Or where he makes them?"</p>

<p>The SAC was not pleased. Not pleased at all.</p>

<p>"Hell,
he's a damned old fat man who has congestive heart failure and limps 
with a cane. My toddler could outrun him. What's wrong with you 
people?"</p>

<p>The ASAC and the three field agents in the room looked 
uncomfortable and none of them met the SAC's gaze. Two of them looked 
at the floor and one looked out the window. The fourth stared at a 
point at least six feet above the SAC's head.</p>

<p>The ASAC cleared 
his throat. "In fairness to the agents here, sir, this man is no 
ordinary person of interest. He knows fieldcraft. I called up Barney 
Williams, you remember sir, the special agent who retired just after you
came here."</p>

<p>The SAC's face betrayed neither emotion nor understanding.</p>

<p>"Anyway,
sir, he said they had the same trouble when they were trying to trail 
him back in the Clinton years. Barney said the guy drove like a bank 
getaway man and had a great many friends to help him with diversions 
when he needed them. He's got the electronics to scan for the latest 
bugs and he's very, very careful about his communications. He seems to 
communicate through both dead and live drops all over the place, but we 
can't catch him at it. If it weren't for the Confidential Informant, 
we wouldn't have known about the testing at all."</p>

<p>The ASAC ran down like a wind-up toy, waiting for the SAC to buy, or reject, his excuse.</p>

<p>The SAC said nothing, staring very intently at a pencil on his desk.</p>

<p>The
ASAC ventured another factoid. "Sir, Williams also said that this guy 
suckered both us and the ATF in the Nineties. He would pretend to 
discuss illegal stuff on the phone just to sucker us into wasting our 
time chasing Tinkerbelles through NeverNever Land. Barney said he 
suckered the ATF into firing the company that cleaned the building 
because he convinced them in a wiretap that janitors were going to put 
brown recluse spiders in the raid gear in their lockers to bite their 
dicks and make them fall off."</p>

<p>Two of the field agents snickered.</p>

<p>The SAC looked up. "You're shitting me," he said flatly.</p>

<p>"No sir, I said the same thing and Barney swore it was true."</p>

<p>The SAC went back to looking at his pencil. "Fieldcraft? Where did he learn that, do we know?"</p>

<p>"No
sir, he was a commie back in the 70s when he was young -- a secret 
member of a Maoist party, the Progressive Labor faction or something. 
Maybe he learned it then."</p>

<p>The SAC deigned to look up again, "A communist? What kind of sense does that make?"</p>

<p>"Sir,
he had some sort of epiphany right afterward. He converted to 
Christianity and turned hard right and has been there ever since. It's 
in his file, he's not shy of talking about it."</p>

<p>The SAC seemed to
see the file in front of him for the very first time. It was a thick 
one, he noted, a very thick one. He flipped it open and an old polaroid
clipped to the inside front flew off and landed at the edge of his desk
top. Reaching out, he retreived it and saw a portly middle aged man 
standing, no, posing, by the tailgate of his pick-up truck. A huge sign
covered it, and the man was smiling broadly.</p>

<p>"What the hell?"</p>

<p>The
ASAC, who was familiar with the file, interjected, "Sir, that was taken
in the late Nineties when the President came to Birmingham to tour the 
tornado damage west of town. The Secret Service actually stopped him on
the street and asked to take a picture of him and his pick-up truck. 
They took several polaroids and we asked for one, according to the 
notes. As I said, he has a sense of humor. I think the Secret Service 
guys did too. They didn't much care for guarding that President and his
wife."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the SAC, "I was alive in the Nineties, Mr. Baird." He shook his head and chuckled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>The sign said, in huge letters, "Hide Yer Wimmin, Clinton's In Town!"</p>

<p>"So,"
the SAC concluded, "We have a dangerous, funny old fat man who's dying 
of congestive heart failure but not fast enough to suit the new 
administration. A man who has a gift for blarney and who may or may not
have destructive devices capable of blowing up vehicles and small 
buildings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," agreed the ASAC, "that's about it."</p>

<p>"Could he be working the CI back on us to make us do something stupid?"</p>

<p>The ASAC thought for a moment. "Yes, sir, he could be."</p>

<p>"And
are we certain of the CI? What are his motives? Is he being paid? Is
he being paid enough? Enough not to double-agent on us?"</p>

<p>The ASAC didn't know and didn't want to admit that he didn't know. The control agent was meeting with the CI right now.</p>

<p>"Sir, I..."</p>

<p>"Well,
find out, dammit. The ATF's on me to let them have him as part of some
big deal case they're working, as if screwing up the Gordon thing 
wasn't enough they think they got to take on this guy and his 
considerable number of friends. But the Hoover Building says no. Not 
just no, but hell no. There's something about this particular guy that 
they want us to handle. OK, so handle it, Mr. Baird!" </p>

<p>He looked around the room, "And you clowns better not lose him again."</p>

<p>They all mumbled yes, sirs, and turned to leave. "And Baird," he added.</p>

<p>"Yes sir?"</p>

<p>"I want a full briefing on that CI before I go home today."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the ASAC said as he closed the door on the way out.</p>

<p>The SAC shifted his gaze to the window and the world outside.</p>

<p>"Shit," he muttered.</p>

<p>What was so special about this guy that the Director was personally interested in keeping him out of the hands of the ATF?</p>

<p>He didn't know, but he intended to find out.</p>

<h4>"A Just Man": The Governor, One Year and Three Months After the Battle of Sipsey Street</h4>

<p>The
last time that Ray Marsh had stood up for an unpopular principle, it 
had cost him his job. This time he knew it would probably cost him his 
freedom and it might well cost him his life if he resisted, which he 
certainly intended to.</p>

<p>Still, that was a trade he was willing to 
make, for he was that kind of man. What pained him was the sure and 
certain knowledge that a whole lot of other folks might die because of 
the decision he was about to take. He hadn't felt this burden since he 
had been a young Captain of infantry 40 years ago and a half a world 
away. This time a whole lot more people stood to lose their lives, and 
the battle would be fought at home, in his beloved Alabama, in his 
people's front yards, in his hometown's streets, and many innocents 
would surely die.</p>

<p>The state motto was "We Dare Defend Our Rights." Ray wondered how many of his fellow citizens besides him believed it.</p>

<p>They were going to find out.</p>

<p>"Take this cup from my lips, Oh Lord," he breathed almost inaudibly. "Show me some other way, if it is Your will."</p>

<p>Ray
Marsh believed in God. His God was the God of Abraham and Isaac, of 
Joshua and David, and, not coincidentally, of the Founders of his 
country. His God had sent His only Son to die upon a cross two 
millennia ago to take upon Himself the sins of all men. His was a Son 
who had said, "If a house be divided against itself, that house cannot 
stand." He was a Son who would one day return to finally vanquish all 
evil and to lay judgment upon the world.</p>

<p>Ray Marsh did not fear 
dying. No man of true faith does. If there was one thing he did fear, 
it was that he would be judged and found wanting by his God. And so he 
prayed, there, on his knees on the carpet in the Governor's office, and 
begged God one more time to give him wisdom, to show him the way in 
which God wanted him to walk.</p>

<p>He was still praying when his chief of staff came into the room quietly and said softly, "It's time, Governor."</p>

<p>Ray sighed, concluded his prayer, rose and turned to face the younger man.</p>

<p>"OK, Jamie," the governor of the sovereign state of Alabama replied. "Let's go do our duty. May God guide us this day."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Jamie Frost, fearing what came next.</p>

<p>Placing
his hand briefly on Jamie's shoulder in reassurance, Ray Marsh walked 
out of his office on his way to start another American War Between the 
States.</p>

<h4>The 3 Percent: "If the cause is right, we will never retreat."</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>"America
has once again arrived at a momentous crossroads. We are going to have
to decide--as we have had to decide so many times in the past--whether we
shall only speak of justice and speak of principle, or whether we shall
stand and fight for them." -- <I>Alan Keyes, 2000.</i></p>

<p>Unfortunately,
while nearly all modern historians agree on the initiating event of the
constitutional crisis variously called the Constitution War, the Second
American Civil War or the War of Restoration, scholarly opinion is 
deeply divided on the underlying causes. At least three-fourths of the 
scholarship on this topic is fundamentally skewed by the political 
opinions of the authors, or that of the audience for which the books are
written. In addition, historical time lines and factual narratives are
incomplete and disputed by both sides. This "factual void" came about 
for four principal reasons.</p>

<p>First,
several of the surviving key participants on both sides of the conflict
failed to leave reliable memoirs. Second, many key state records were 
lost in the Federal attacks on Montgomery and Birmingham. Third, many 
Federal records were lost in EMP attacks carried out by the Alabama 
Constitutionalists and independent formations allied with them. Fourth,
the technological ability to digitally create "news footage" to suit 
propaganda war needs, and the documented use of what has come to be 
called "disinformation warfare" by the Federal side in that conflict, 
calls into question even the most elemental military and political 
aspects of the crisis. Some skirmishes, assassinations and sabotage 
reported as fact on the evening news seem never to have taken place at 
all, and the reporting of many other such incidents was often "doctored"
to spin the Federal side into a more positive light for public 
consumption. Such inventions of fact make the writing of reliable 
history hazardous at best...</p>

<p>Perhaps
the most succinct explanation of the conflict was offered by an aged 
veteran of the Alabama State Defense Force interviewed by the oral 
historian William Granger in May, 2044. Then in his nineties, retired 
Sergeant Major Ford "Skip" Munson, said "The Feds had been pushing us 
away from our God-given liberties for seventy years. They finally 
pushed us into a corner, and we pushed back."</p>

<p>The
results of the presidential election made a constitutional crisis 
inevitable, although whether it would have happened as early as it did 
without the confluence of events represented by the Battle of Sipsey 
Street and the earlier election of Ray Marsh as Governor of the state of
Alabama is still the subject of historical debate. Even prior to both 
events, many felt that it wasn't so much that the country was divided, 
as it was two entirely different countries within one border.</p>

<p>Oh,
Americans shared the same language and the same cultural heritage and 
history. They lived in the same neighborhoods, talked to each other at 
work and carried their kids to the same football games or soccer 
practices. But by the Battle of Sipsey Street, language and proximity 
was about all they shared. Each side viewed reality from a 
fundamentally different perspective.</p>

<p>Worse, there was a sharp 
divide over what kind of nation and government would inherit the 21st 
Century. The Democrats felt that the results of the previous 
presidential election had settled the matter and they proceeded to 
remake the country in their image.</p>

<p>Arguments over philosophy rarely end in bloodshed.</p>

<p>Arguments over power often do.</p>

<p>And
as Abraham Lincoln quoted from the book of Mark: "If a house be divided
against itself, that house cannot stand." Lincoln was speaking of the 
divide over slavery, yet the divisions in American society at the 
opening of the 21st Century were just as deep, if not deeper, as those 
in 1860.</p>

<p>By the time of the Battle of Sipsey Street, these divisions were leading to the same sort of bloody argument.</p>

<p>One
side believed that the Constitution was a "living" document and could 
be changed to suit "modern circumstances." Consequently, things such 
abortion, gun control and homosexual marriage were perfectly 
constitutional if a majority of Supreme Court justices said they were. 
This side viewed government power as the solution to most, if not all, 
problems, and woe betide anyone who disagreed with paying the taxes 
necessary to achieve their noble goals. These Americans (called 
"liberals" by their opponents but self-described as "progressives") were
collectivist and even socialist in their economic beliefs and secular 
humanist in their philosophy. The movers and shakers of this half of 
America believed in the supremacy of "enlightened" man over "out-dated" 
laws and "old-fashioned" religious beliefs. More importantly, they 
believed the federal government had both the right and the duty to 
implement their vision of America. Their critics derisively referred to
them as "the anointed" and that wasn't far from the truth.</p>

<p>The 
anointed believed that God, if He existed at all, was welcome to His 
place in Heaven, if that existed, as long as no one on earth in their 
temporal kingdom took Him or His commandments too seriously. Man, not 
God, ought to govern affairs down here on earth, or so said the 
anointed. And if someone, anyone, was made uncomfortable by the public 
display of the Ten Commandments or prayer in school (or anywhere else 
for that matter), then such displays or prayers must be forbidden to 
all. They believed in tolerance, these anointed elites, unless it was 
tolerance for anything with which they disagreed.</p>

<p>Pornography? No problem.</p>

<p>Drugs? No problem.</p>

<p>Corruption of public officials (at least those who belonged to their own party)? Expected.</p>

<p>Devil worshipping chaplains in the US Army? Certainly.</p>

<p>Abortion? Of course.</p>

<p>Sexual profligacy? Encouraged.</p>

<p>Homosexuality? Naturally.</p>

<p>Pedophilia,
necrophilia, and any other kind of philia? Well, they might swallow 
nervously, but, yes, who were they to question anyone's morality or 
presume to tell them how to live? Who indeed?</p>

<p>Not that the 
anointed didn't insist on telling others how to live. They specialized 
in it. It was just that there were two standards. One for those with 
whom they agreed, and another for all the rest.</p>

<p>The other side 
held an older vision of what America had been and should be. For one 
thing, they believed in the rule of law: for everyone, applied equally, 
without fear or favor. To them, the Constitution was a fundamentally 
sound document as written by Founders who, having experienced oppression
themselves, knew exactly what they doing when they limited the central 
government's powers in the Bill of Rights. They believed that modifying
or adding to the original system of the Founders should never be done 
lightly and that those who called it a "living" document because they 
wanted to be rid of one inconvenient restriction or another merely 
wanted it dead. They also believed that all true law, sometimes called
natural law, was derived from God, and that the Constitution merely 
codified that which God had ordained.</p>

<p>They believed in God, this 
half of America, and it was the God of Abraham and Isaac, of Moses and 
David. They didn't think that God was dead or irrelevant as many of 
their opponents did. They believed that almost 50 million abortions was
state-sanctioned mass murder that put the German Nazis to shame. They 
believed that the Old and New Testaments were pretty explicit that 
homosexuality was an abomination, and they were universally certain that
the federal government didn't have the right to prohibit either their 
public prayers or the display of the Ten Commandments. Nor, come to 
that, could it lawfully demand that their sons' Boy Scout troop leader 
be a member of the North American Man-Boy Love Association. They were 
also certain that if you spit in God's eye long enough, God spits back, 
and when He does, civilizations fall, governments topple, entire peoples
are enslaved and cities disappear in the fiery blink of an eye.</p>

<p>They
believed that the Second Amendment meant exactly what the Founders 
intended it to say: that "the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
shall not be infringed." They were a praying people, these Americans, 
and they went to church or synagogue. And if many of them weren't 
exactly regular attendees, they at least recognized where they were 
supposed to be on the Sabbath, whatever day of the week they believed it
to be. But, almost universally, they prayed for God's guidance and for
the deliverance of their society from a tidal wave of obscenity, 
pornography, venality and sin. They prayed that their children could 
grow up in country better than that they had grown up in, not worse.</p>

<p>Some
of these people called themselves "conservatives"; their opponents 
variously called them "right wingers", "gun nuts" and "religious 
fanatics". But most of them didn't think of themselves as one label or 
another, merely as plain old Americans. They resented the identity 
politics of their opponents, where one minority group or another got 
special consideration from the government. They were suspicious of 
anyone who considered themselves a "hyphenated American".</p>

<p>Weren't we all Americans?</p>

<p>Hadn't we all come from somewhere else and struggled to make the country's promise our own by hard work and sacrifice?</p>

<p>Why should one group or another be considered more worthy than any other?</p>

<p>To
them, the argument over whether the society should treat all men and 
women "not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character" had been long settled. To the more religious among them, not
only was God colorblind but He required them to be as well.</p>

<p>Oh, 
they recognized that according to the Constitution and common sense, the
government had no business trying to keep someone from privately 
sinning. But they resented it deeply when sin became public policy, 
when they were daily reminded of it in the media and by government 
directive, when their kids were immersed in it at school and on 
television. They recognized that the leaders and citizenry of the 
country were no longer bound by any moral standard whatsoever, and it 
frightened and angered them. What were their children to inherit? 21st
Century America certainly bore little resemblance to the country they 
had been born into.</p>

<p>And out of this mix of religious belief, 
sense of loss and outrage, came the certainty that someone, someday, 
would have to do something about it.</p>

<p>And one day, almost by accident, Phil Gordon did.</p>

<p>To
those on both sides who had been paying attention, this came as no 
surprise. Even the liberal columnist E.J. Dionne, Jr. wrote with great 
prescience in late August, 2004:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Because
the 2000 election was so close, the idea of an American deeply divided 
by region seemed entirely natural. We certainly are polarized 
politically. There are Americans who love George W. Bush and Americans 
who despise him. However this year's voting turns out, something close 
to half of us will be furious if not seditious come the morning after 
election day."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A wordsmith by trade, Dionne knew exactly 
what "seditious" meant when he wrote it. He may not have understood how
right he was at the time but events were to prove he had 20-20 
foresight. Yet, when the break came, no one was more astounded than the
liberal elites that Dionne wrote for.</p>

<p>Said one Alabama militiaman at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Liberals
have no deeply-held principles that they will not compromise if pushed,
so they don't understand people who will fight and die rather than 
compromise. I guess that's what made the war inevitable. We'd been 
warning 'em for years, but they never thought we'd put our lives on the 
line just because they never had the guts to. They figured that if the 
federal government told us to do somethin' then, by God, we'd have to 
give in, whereas we knew that when push came to shove, we, by God, would
NEVER give in... that they'd have to kill us first. And you know what? 
A man who's willing to die for his country is 99 times out of 100 a man
who will kill for it too. And THAT was a part of the equation those 
pointy-headed liberals never counted on."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The culture and 
philosophy of the rebels of Phil Gordon's stripe, like many of their 
individual bloodlines, was Scots-Irish. It traced its lineage from 
highland freedom fighters like William Wallace and the hard-headed 
Scotch Covenanters through generations of Irish revolutionaries, across 
the pitiless Atlantic to these shores. James Webb, Secretary of the 
Navy in the Reagan administration and later, ironically, Democrat U.S. 
Senator from Virginia, wrote this of the Scots-Irish in 2004,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They
tamed the wilderness, building simple log cabins and scraping corn 
patches in thin soil. And they pressed onward, creating a way of life 
that many would call, if not American, certainly the defining fabric of 
the South and Midwest, as well as the core character of the nation's 
working class... They came with nothing, and, for a complicated set of 
reasons, many of them still have nothing... These people are too often 
misconstrued and ignored when America's history is told. They did great
things. And in truth, the Scots-Irish... are a force that still 
shapes our culture. The Scots-Irish brought with them a strong, 
bottom-up individualism... Their unique soldierly traditions formed 
the backbone of the country's military, particularly in the Army and 
Marine Corps...</p>

<p>The 
traditional Scots-Irish culture, like America itself, is a study in wild
contrasts. These are an intensely religious people--indeed, they 
comprise the very heart of the Christian evangelical movement--and yet 
they are also unapologetically and even devilishly hedonistic. They are
probably the most anti-authoritarian culture in America, conditioned 
from birth to resist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>said Webb, noting that even Rosa Parks, 
whose refusal to go to the back of the bus sparked the modern civil 
rights movement, spoke with pride of her Scots-Irish great-grandfather.</p>

<p>Despite this anti-authoritarianism, continued Webb,</p>

<blockquote>
they
are known as the most intensely patriotic segment of the country as 
well. They are naturally rebellious, often impossible to control, and 
yet their strong military tradition produces generation after generation
of perhaps the finest soldiers the world has ever seen. They are 
filled with wanderlust, but no matter how far they roam, their passion 
for family travels with them. Underlying these seeming contradictions 
is a strong unwritten code of personal honor and individual 
accountability.<p></blockquote>

<p>Independence.</p>

<p>Honor.</p>

<p>Family.</p>

<p>Personal responsibility.</p>

<p>God.</p>

<p>On
all of these tenets of the Scots-Irish faith, the new administration 
was bound to fail to live up to the standards of these traditional 
Americans, and fail it did. There were too many campaign debts owed to
the left-liberals of the Democrat party for it to be any different. 
From the moment the new president took over, by fiat and judicial 
appointment the administration began to violate every one of the 
Scots-Irish's most cherished beliefs, systematically intruding the 
federal government into their personal lives.</p>

<p>It began with guns,
just as it had in the Clinton Administration. The alphabet agencies 
were packed with bureaucrats whose first reflexive actions on November 
3rd were designed to curry favor with the incoming bosses.</p>

<p>Just 
as the ATF had sought to please the anti-gun Clintons by carrying out 
the Waco raid, the agency dusted off plans and operations that had been 
shelved since January, 2001. Out of this eargerness to please their new
masters came the raid on Phil Gordon and the Battle of Sipsey Street.</p>

<p>It
did not help that the judicial appointments of the new administration 
to the federal courts (and the decisions which those justices wrote) 
were fantastically unpopular with the citizens who later participated in
the rebellion. The 5-4 decision in <i>Barney vs. Boy Scouts of America</i>
which mandated that the Scouts include homosexuals and even pedophiles 
as scoutmasters along the Canadian model resulted in the destruction of 
that historic youth group. And the formation of alternative youth 
organizations such as the Christian Scouts of America and the Jewish 
Scouts of America hastened the process of polarization in the society 
into religious and non-religious camps.</p>

<p>The new liberal tilt of 
the Supremes was felt in decisions on everything from property rights to
guns to free speech. The Court's application of the so-called 
"fairness doctrine" to radio and television just about killed commercial
conservative talk radio. The removal of this important means of 
sharing information and venting opinions against the new regime caused 
great frustration. The people began to believe that someone was trying 
to silence their complaints and worse, that there was no redress 
possible in the courts or the political process. It was natural that 
some folks concluded that the only thing that they could do to defend 
their rights was to clean their guns and be ready to use them.</p>

<p>A 
new word began cropping up in conservative circles to describe their 
opponents: "anti-constitutional." The right had described the 
Clintonista measures of the decade before as "unconstitutional". 
Somehow that did not seem a strong enough word to describe what was 
really going on in the new administration, and "anti-constitutional" was
perhaps a more accurate description.</p>

<p>And just as the government 
got more oppressive, the culture war continued to escalate. But now the
body count was starting to hit closer to home for conservatives. A 
satanist rock band, Dark Prince, cut an album entitled "Worshiping the 
Master." The title track suggested that the best way to honor Beelzebub
was to start stacking up bodies of their enemies, the Christian 
faithful. On April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine school massacre
and Adolf Hitler's birthday, 18 year old Alex Benjamin, a satanist and 
Dark Prince fan, shot his way into a Baptist sunday school building in 
Centerpoint, Alabama. Before he was in turn shot dead by a churchgoer 
who never went anywhere without his pocket pistol, Benjamin killed 3 
adults and 12 children, ages six to thirteen. He died with a smile on 
his face.</p>

<p>Benjamin became a folk anti-hero in some quarters and 
over the next six months copy cat massacres spread across fourteen 
states. In California, a yeshiva was targeted by a self-proclaimed 
Odinist. This specimen of twisted humanity claimed in a note found 
after the attack that he killed his victims in the sincere hope that if 
enough bodies were stacked up, the gates of Vahalla would spring open 
and Odin and all his other Norse biker-god buddies would come roaring 
back out onto the earth to reign in blood and terror. Thirty-seven 
people, mostly children, died in the yeshiva attack. On the door was 
posted a sign in bold letters: "Absolutely no firearms allowed." When 
he ran out of victims, the Odinist killed himself.</p>

<p>After that, 
the Jewish Defense League began to experience a resurgence, not only in 
California, but all over the country. Christian volunteers also began 
providing armed security for their own church properties and, in four 
cases, would-be mass murderers were killed in the parking lot before 
they could strike down innocents at worship, thus getting to meet the 
Devil a little earlier than they had planned. A website devoted to the
fad carried this advice to the satanist faithful: "Don't target the 
Catholics, Baptists, Methodists or Presbyterians. They're more likely 
to pack when they pray. Hit the Unitarian-Universalists, they believe 
in gun control."</p>

<p>To the Scots-Irish, especially the Christians 
among them, it seemed as if the world were turned upside down. Robert 
Thomas Barry, an oil-patch worker from Hobbs, New Mexico, put it this 
way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know, this is worse 
than 1860. A Tidewater cotton planter and a cod-eating New Hampshire 
Yankee had more in common with each other than we do with our own 
countrymen today. They prayed to the same God, believed in the same rule
of law, and shared the same heritage. The only thing they disagreed 
about was slavery. Now that's a pretty big thing, but at least they 
considered each other to be countrymen. These people? Why these people
are the enemy... They are the antithesis of everything we believe in. 
God, private property, morals everything. It scares me I don't know 
these people. I don't understand these people. They are aliens. Its 
like the invasion of the body snatchers. They look like us. They talk 
like us. But they are NOT us! Do you realize that I have no reasonable
expectation that the basic concept of my house is my house and yours is
yours is respected? I have no reasonable expectation that my 
daughter's chastity is of any interest to them. I have no reasonable 
expectation that THEIR OWN daughters' chastity is of any interest to 
them. And if I'm so rude as to point this fact out to them, they have 
no idea what I'm talking about. I could be talking in Urdu. The bottom
line is, we're God-fearing, life-loving, freedom-cherishing responsible
 people, and they ain't. And you know what? As time goes by, we get 
fewer and they get more numerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the devout 
tradition-loving people of the country who increasingly felt like a 
despised minority in their own homeland, the new administration looked 
like the local representatives of the Devil himself.</p>

<p>As the 
months rolled by, and the country grew more chaotic and yet less free, 
some of them came to a conclusion: this can't go on much longer. 
History, they knew, is made by determined minorities. For good or ill, 
majorities coalesce around the few who have the will to resist the tides
of the history and the strength to swim upstream dragging the rest of 
the society with them.</p>

<p>During the American Revolution, for 
example, one third of the colonists were against British rule, one third
were for it, and the final third blew with the wind, willing to take 
whatever came. Indeed, there were more colonists who served in the 
military forces of the Crown than served under Washington. In the end, 
the Revolution was accomplished by less than 3 percent of the population
fighting as combatants, actively supported by a mere 10 percent of 
their countrymen.</p>

<p>Just 3 percent to fight the greatest military power then in the world.</p>

<p>3 percent.</p>

<p>And they won.</p>

<p>When James Webb wrote these words in 2004, he, like Dionne, was more right than he knew:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The
Scots-Irish are a fiercely independent individualist people. It goes 
against their grain to think collectively. But, as America rushes 
forward into yet another redefinition of itself, the contributions of 
the Scots-Irish are too great to remain invisible. My culture needs to 
reclaim itself--stop letting others define, mock and even use it. 
Because our country needs us. We are the molten core at the very center
of its unbridled, raw, rebellious spirit. We helped build this nation 
from the bottom up. We face the world on our feet and not on our knees.
 We were born fighting. And if the cause is right, we will never 
retreat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However cognitively dissonant he was in hitching
his political wagon to the collectivist Democrat party who largely 
despised the traditions of the Scotch-Irish, beginning with the Battle 
of Sipsey Street, Webb's prediction unfolded with swift and startling 
prescience.</p>

<h4>"Old Dog": 3 weeks after the Battle of Sipsey Street</h4>

<p>Office of the Governor of the State of Alabama<br/>
10:00 AM Central</p>

<p>The
men and women filed into the office gravely, somberly. The subject of 
this meeting was Phil Gordon, the Battle of Sipsey Street, more than a 
hundred dead federal agents on Alabama soil, and what the state of 
Alabama was going to do about it, if anything.</p>

<p>The Governor 
looked out the window, lost in thought as the members of his new 
administration took their seats. As the last invited attendee came 
through the double doors, the Director of the Department of Public 
Safety leaped to his feet and strode across the carpet to clap him on 
the shoulder and shake his hand.</p>

<p>"Jack, you old dog, howinhell ya been?"</p>

<p>Jack
Durer, pushing 70 and still the tallest, if grayest haired, man in the 
room, returned the greeting warmly in his booming bass voice:</p>

<p>"Hell, Billy, I rode in here on my Harley from Chilton County. I guess that counts for something."</p>

<p>The exchange drew the Governor out of his reverie. He pivoted his chair to face his staff directly. He nodded at Durer.</p>

<p>"Jack, thank you for coming. Billy tells me you have a lot to contribute to our understanding of the overall picture."</p>

<p>Now seated, Jack Durer nodded, "Yes, sir, I believe I do."</p>

<p>"All, right. Billy, what do we know about what really happened at Sipsey Street?"</p>

<p>The
DPS director began his briefing. The Governor had heard most of it in 
dribs and drabs over the past three weeks, but it was many in the room's
first time to hear the story.</p>

<p>It wasn't pretty.</p>

<p>From 
confidential sources in the public and private sectors, DPS had 
determined that Gordon had probably not deserved the attentions of the 
feds. It seemed that he had not crossed the line into illegality until 
after he learned he was being targeted by the ATF, and in that he had 
only (only!) broken the laws on the use of explosives. He had his 
blaster's license, after all, so mere possession was not illegal. The 
firearms he had used were all semi-automatic so the allegation by the 
ATF of automatic weapons possession was bogus as near as anyone could 
reconstruct from the wreckage left by the explosion of Gordon's gun 
safe. The ATF had apparently picked on Gordon because they didn't like 
him running his mouth, writing letters to the editor and politicians 
about ATF abuses. Only they'd finally picked the wrong victim. Of 
course the ATF was saying he was the greatest madman mass murderer of 
all time, but that was true only if Gordon hadn't been acting in self 
defense.</p>

<p>"So," the Governor said when Billy Mitchell finished, "was it self defense?"</p>

<p>The DPS director looked up from his notes.</p>

<p>"Governor,
the Attorney General can probably speak to that subject 
professionally," the director nodded toward dark-skinned AG across the 
room, "but I'd say that if he had lived, and his defense had access to 
the information we've uncovered, his lawyer could make a damned good 
case it was self-defense."</p>

<p>The AG nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Mitchell continued, "But sir, Jack here knew Phil Gordon personally. I'd like you to hear his opinion."</p>

<p>The Governor turned to Jack Durer.</p>

<p>"What can you tell me?"</p>

<p>Billy
Mitchell interrupted. "Governor, I know there's a lot of folks here 
who probably don't know Jack or his history of service to Alabama."</p>

<p>He paused, and the Governor nodded his assent.</p>

<p>"Jack
Durer retired a few years ago after serving in DPS from the Wallace to 
the James administrations. He ran the Intelligence unit of the Alabama 
Bureau of Investigation for many years and he's kept up his sources of 
information since then. There's more than a couple crooked politicians 
in this state who are out of office or behind bars because of Jack's 
work -- and that's AFTER he retired. If there's something going on in 
the state that Jack doesn't know about, it's either unimportant or one 
of his informants hasn't checked in yet."</p>

<p>Jack Durer grinned. "Thanks, Billy, that's quite a buildup."</p>

<p>Actually,
it wasn't close to being half the story. Oh, Durer had had a long and 
fabled career in the Alabama State Troopers and ABI, to be sure. But he
was, as they say, a man of many parts. Before his career in Alabama 
law enforcement, Jack Durer had served in the 5th Special Forces Group 
in Vietnam, eventually working for, and becoming friends with, the 
legendary Bill Colby of the CIA in the Phoenix Program. He had 
maintained his contacts in the spook community since then and they had 
often paid him, and the people of the great state of Alabama, great 
dividends in the intervening years.</p>

<p>Not that the people of the 
state would ever know it. Jack Durer was also a man who could keep 
secrets, especially his own. Most of those crooked politicians that 
he'd arranged jail time for never knew his fingerprints were on their 
case files. They never knew he was coming, what hit them, or that he 
had ever been there in the first place. He still carried his 5th Group 
coin in his wallet, and had lived its motto, "De Oppresso Liber" -- "To
Free the Oppressed."</p>

<p>Durer lost his smile as he faced the Governor.</p>

<p>"Sir,
Phil Gordon was as law-abiding a feller as I ever knew. We didn't meet
in Vietnam, but I got to know him, I guess about five or six years 
after we came home, at an Alabama Gun Collectors Association gunshow. 
Phil was a serious gun nut and so am I. He always despised the ATF for 
Waco and their many more minor sins over the years, but he always obeyed
their stupid laws and regulations even though he thought they were 
unconstitutional. I hadn't talked to him for almost a year, right after
his wife died. After he was killed I spent a little time running down 
sources that I have within the ATF and FBI. I've shared some of that, 
but not all, with your director of DPS here," nodding at Billy, "and 
I'll tell you that the ATF did not intend for Phil to survive that raid.
 They wanted his scalp."</p>

<p>Durer paused.</p>

<p>"What I believe is
that Phil Gordon, learning by accident that he had been targeted by the
ATF for his opinions, decided to teach them a lesson about picking on 
the wrong feller, and by God, he sure did."</p>

<p>Jack paused again. "But was it self-defense? Hell, yes. No doubt about it."</p>

<p>Roy Marsh turned to his Attorney General.</p>

<p>"Robert, what do you conclude?"</p>

<p>The
immaculately dressed AG, Alabama's first black man to serve in that 
post and widely expected to succeed Roy Marsh as Governor, replied 
without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Sir, not only was it self defense, I'd consider bringing murder charges against the ATF agents responsible."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"If any of them were still alive."</p>

<p>Jack Durer chuckled, and the room stirred.</p>

<p>The Governor did not smile.</p>

<p>"You
know," speaking to no one in particular, "I went to many of those ATF 
funerals. I didn't go to Phil Gordon's. I was advised not to."</p>

<p>Here, the Governor looked hard at his Chief of Staff.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should have."</p>

<p>"Gosh knows there's at least half the state who think you should have," said his press secretary. "They believe he's a hero."</p>

<p>"Maybe he was," said the Republican senate minority leader.</p>

<p>"But you'd better not say so in public," the press secretary shot back. "You'll end up with a federal tax audit at least."</p>

<p>Jack
Durer spoke up. He hadn't come here to honor Phil Gordon or to bury 
him. The state was about to come apart and Ray Marsh needed to know it.</p>

<p>"Sir,
there's more pressing business because of this, and Phil Gordon's last 
stand is going to look like a Disney World ride if you don't deal with 
it."</p>

<p>Ray Marsh replied, "Go ahead."</p>

<h4>"De Oppresso Liber"</h4>

<p>"Governor,
Alabama has had a large and active militia movement for almost twenty 
years now. Most of 'em are real quiet, but they've been training, most 
of 'em, since the '90s. And ever since the new administration took 
over, they've been growing -- growing BIG, and growing more competent. 
My sources within the movement tell me that its all they can do to 
restrain their members from attacking the feds right now. And its not 
like they have full control over their troops. They're militia, all 
volunteers, and leading them is like herding cats and chickens at the 
same time, as one of them told me. There is no Betty Crocker Seal of 
Approval for militias. There's racists out there, Kluxers and Nazis, 
who have been waiting for something like this. The responsible leaders 
will help us prevent terrorism if they can, but they want assurances 
that the state is going to do what it can to prevent the ATF from 
attacking them like Phil Gordon. And if the ATF screws up and attacks 
one of them like they did Phil, they'll ALL react. They've been sitting 
on ready for three weeks. And not just here, all over the country. 
You've seen the headlines, sir. Surely you know where this is headed. 
It's going to get bloody. And with the new laws coming down the pike..."</p>

<p>Durer let the menace of that thought hang in the air.</p>

<p>Billy
Mitchell put in, "I'll tell you this, they're badgering me about it. 
Kraut Mueller's called me twice a day since it happened, "touching base"
and wanting to know what we're going to do to keep the ATF from doing 
it again."</p>

<p>The press secretary snorted, "Mueller? That fat old windbag? He's all talk."</p>

<p>Durer's head pivoted like a machine gun traversing until his steely gaze locked in on the PR flack.</p>

<p>"That, I have reason to know, is incorrect. Kraut Mueller is a lot more than talk."</p>

<p>The press secretary tried to hold Durer's eyes and failed, looking down at his feet.</p>

<p>The
Governor looked about the room. Everyone here, save Durer, was part of
what he called his "kitchen cabinet." They could be trusted, he 
thought, with what was going to come next without leaking it to the 
press or the feds.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack," the Governor said mildly, "as it
happens the Attorney General and I have had some ideas along those 
lines. Robert, why don't you tell us about the Doctrine of 
Interposition and how it may apply here?"</p>

<p>The AG smiled broadly,</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>He began, "The Doctrine of Interposition goes back to English common law..."</p>

<p>And
as they listened to the AG's presentation, they began to see where this
was headed. For his part, Jack Durer reached into his back pocket and 
fetched his 5th Group coin from his wallet. As the Attorney General 
spoke, he idly flipped it over and over in his right hand.</p>

<p>"De Oppresso Liber."</p>

<p>As the immaculately-dressed <i>magna cum laude</i> graduate of Harvard Law School concluded his presentation, the "old dog" knew he was going back to war one last time.</p>

<p>And he smiled.</p>

<p>Only those who knew him best would have seen the hint of the deep sadness behind it.</p>

<h4>3 February 1965: Bogalusa, Louisiana - The Skirmish at Andrey's Cafe</span></h4>

<p>He
was back in Korea, cold, scared and mad as hell when somewhere in the 
distance, at the edges of his consciousness, a phone rang. </p>

<p>Bobby
Williams, third shift maintenance man at the Crown-Zellerbach paper 
plant, wasn't due to get up for another three hours. He groaned and 
rolled over, burying his head deeper into the pillow.</p>

<p>It kept ringing.</p>

<p>A thought penetrated the haze. Where was Lucy?</p>

<p>"Crap," Bobby muttered, and threw the covers back and sat up.</p>

<p>The phone stopped.</p>

<p>"Figures," he sighed.</p>

<p>He
could hear Lucille talking, her voice rising, but couldn't make out the
words. Sitting on the side of the bed in his underwear, he rubbed his 
eyes and then ran his right hand back and forth over the close cropped 
hair on his head, trying to lose the grogginess. He looked at the clock
on the nightstand.</p>

<p>"Crap."</p>

<p>He'd never get back to sleep now. Might as well get up.</p>

<p>As
he did, his wife threw open the door and blurted out, "Bobby! Joe 
Baker says those two white boys from CORE is getting beat to death by 
the Klan down in front of Andrey's. He says meet him at Aunt Sylvie's 
right behind there as soon as you can."</p>

<p>She paused, and then in fear for her husband moaned aloud, "Oh, Bobby."</p>

<p>Bobby Williams was awake instantly. They had planned for this, him and Joe and some of the men from the plant.</p>

<p>"Get
my rifle and my clips from the front closet," he ordered and set about 
throwing on his clothes. They were dirty from the night before, draped 
over the chipped wooden chair in the corner.</p>

<p>If'n I die in 'em, t'won't matter one way or t'other if they're clean or dirty, he thought. </p>

<p>He yelled after his wife through the open door, "And get me a glass of water!"</p>

<p>Thirsty, he remembered with a tight smile. Combat always did make me thirsty.</p>

<p>In
about as much time as it takes to tell, Bobby Williams met his wife at 
the front door. His Garand leaned against the doorframe.  Lucy stood 
there, as beautiful as the day he married her despite the two daughters 
she'd borne him and a third child almost here any day now and everything
else in a hate-filled world gone crazy. His glass of of water was in 
her left hand and the bandoleer marked ".30 Caliber M-2 Ball" in her 
right.</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>Lord, she had pretty eyes. It 
was her eyes that first drew him to her, that afternoon at the church 
picnic that seemed like an eternity ago now. At this instant, tears 
were forming in them.</p>

<p>Bobby took the glass from her hand, 
tenderly, and gulped down the water. Then, words failing him, he hugged
Lucy tight for a long moment, her swollen belly pressing against him. 
He released her, took the bandoleer from her hand and slung it over his 
head so it dangled on his right side.</p>

<p>Then he grabbed the rifle and ran out the front door.</p>

<p>Behind him, Lucille Wiliiams began to sob.

<hr/>

<p>A
historian would later write that "the eatery was a tiny matchbox of a 
building, little more than a single room 15 by 15 feet." But just right
now, it was a battlefield in a war.</p>

<p>And the first shots had already been fired.</p>

<p>Bill
Yates and Steve Miller were two white activists of the Congress of 
Racial Equality, come to Bogalusa that day to meet with local black 
labor officials down at the Negro Union Hall. When they left the Hall 
to drive back to New Orleans in Miller's car, they noticed a shadowing 
vehicle full of white guys. As it happened, and it was no coincidence, 
the car held five stalwarts of the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
 They were there to teach these two "nigger lovers" a lesson about 
meddling in things that weren't any concern of theirs.</p>

<p>The two 
unarmed civil rights activists, knowing that if they continued on out of
town along the narrow two-lane highway that ran between Bogalusa and 
New Orleans they would be easy pickings, pulled into Andrey's to use the
pay phone to call for help.</p>

<p>Yates, the older man, leaped out of
the car and hit the ground running, making for the front door. The 
Klan vehicle pulled in front of Miller's blocking the path. Shots rang 
out, though no one was hit, and one of the Kluxers threw brick at 
Miller's car.</p>

<p>The Klansmen leaped out and ran down Yates before 
he could get inside the cafe. Throwing him to the ground, they began to
dance on him a bit. The Kluxers toyed with him, giving him a broken 
hand and severe internal injuries, before he escaped and staggered into 
the front door of Andrey's. Miller backed his car out of the roadblock 
and then on around the back of the cafe, parked it and joined his 
injured friend inside.</p>

<p>As Yates held his sides and groaned, 
Miller peeked out the door and saw four more carloads of Klansmen join 
the first and slowly drive up, down and around the cafe, "circling their
prey," as one historian later put it.</p>

<p>They were trying to work their courage up for another go at it.</p>

<p>Miller
began to feed coins into the pay phone, calling everybody he knew. 
Local white telephone operators refused to put through calls to the 
black community, so Miller called his mother long distance in San 
Francisco, who in turn called other civil rights activists who in their 
turn called the FBI and the Louisiana state attorney general and the 
media.</p>

<p>"Remember Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney?" Miller asked a 
UPI reporter on the phone. "Well you're talking to the next ones right 
here. We're about to get it."</p>

<p>But Miller, understandly panicked, was exaggerating the situation. He was wrong for two reasons.</p>

<p>First,
the Klan had a problem. Surprised by the dash into Andrey's parking 
lot, they had jumped the CORE activists at the edge of Bogalusa's Negro 
community. This wasn't some lonely road with no witnesses. Although 
the streets had emptied when the shots were fired, there were any number
of witnesses peeking out from windows and doorways.</p>

<p>In 
addition, some of these men, the leaders, were well-known in the black 
community. They knew that. Even so, the Klan had reigned around 
Bogalusa for almost a hundred years. They owned the local police, the 
Sheriff, and other politicians.</p>

<p>But still, their courage, if you
can call it that in such cravenly human specimens, failed them. Too 
stupid to carry out their original plan correctly, too scared to finish 
the job and too proud to just call it a day and drive away, they waited.
 They waited until something very strange happened -- that second thing
I was talking about.</p>

<p>It was something almost unprecedented in 
the Klan's experience heretofore. Something they'd talked a lot about, 
but had never, in their secret heart of hearts, ever thought would 
happen.</p>

<p>And that something was the Deacons for Defense and Justice.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
paper plant workers watched from concealment (not cover, Bobby 
recognized ruefully) at the back of Aunt Sylvie's as the Klan cars 
paraded up and down in front of Andrey's Cafe and then stop for a 
palaver as the Kluxers discussed what to do. They watched the Klan and 
Aunt Sylvie watched them from her back window, unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Black mens with guns, Lord have mercy," she worried.</p>

<p>The
men were all blown from the exertion of their various runs to get to 
the rendezvous. Sweating profusely despite the cool February weather, 
Joe Baker wheezed air in and out of his tortured lungs and complained, 
"Damn, I'm too old for this shit."</p>

<p>Bobby Williams smiled at him, "I been telling you you gotta quit smoking. It just kills your wind."</p>

<p>Baker,
a short, lean man with skin the color of coffee with cream, just 
wheezed and spat, looking back sourly at Bobby, who was ten years 
younger, twice his size and three times blacker.</p>

<p>Bobby took stock
one last time. One Garand, an M-1 Carbine, two lever-action .30-30 
deer rifles, a twelve gauge pump shotgun and the .45 automatic that Joe 
Baker had brought back from the Pacific twenty years ago. Aside from 
Bobby and Bill Waverly, the guy with the carbine, they had maybe twenty 
rounds apiece, no more. Bill only had a fifteen round mag for back up 
and a thirty round banana mag in the weapon. Forty five rounds. Bobby 
had eight in the Garand and forty-eight in the bandoleer. </p>

<p>That was it. Plus the lever-actions and the shotgun would be slow in reloading.</p>

<p>Thin, real thin. Well, he'd fought Chinks with less. And these mostly-fat crackers ain't nearly as tough as Chinks. </p>

<p>He smiled, as much to give his men courage as anything. Bobby decided. </p>

<p>"Alright,
 we'll do this one at a time. I'll go first, then you Joe, then the 
rest of you. The ones behind will cover the one crossing. The next to 
last man covers the last man from the backdoor, got it? Bill, you got 
the carbine and plenty of firepower so you come last. We're puttin' all
of us into that little shack, I know, but reinforcements are on the way
and I want to make a good show."</p>

<p>He swallowed hard. Thirsty again, his mouth was dry as dust.</p>

<p>"Don't start anything. But if they start shootin', shoot to kill." </p>

<p>Bobby
paused, looking at them in their faces, each in turn. They'd talked 
about this, but they'd never practiced it. Still, every man was a 
veteran of some war. The Army or Marines had trained them, and trained 
them well.</p>

<p>Bobby grunted softly. Well, it would just have to do.</p>

<p>"You with me?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," the other men, led by Joe, muttered their assent, some of them just nodding.</p>

<p>Yeah, they were determined.</p>

<p>This Klan shit ends here.</p>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>Bobby
looked again. No time like the present. He leaped up and sprinted 
with his Garand held at high port in front of him across the danger 
space, and came to rest with his back to Andrey's back door.</p>

<p>Out front, Joe Carl Thornton saw him.</p>

<p>"Hollingsworth!"
he yelled to one of the Klan leaders, "I just saw a nigger with a gun 
run into the back! Shit! There goes another one!"</p>

<p>Another Kluxer from down the block yelled, "Hell, there's a bunch of 'em!"</p>

<p>The
Kluxers who had guns raised them, but hesitated, uncertain about what 
to do as most of them couldn't see what was happening. Autie Shingler, 
whose only weapon was a baseball bat, looked down at the Louisville 
Slugger stupidly and shuddered. He didn't want to die in no shootout 
with no niggers this day or any other.</p>

<p>Delos Williams, another Klan leader and no relation to Bobby, yelled out the pertinent question, "How many of 'em?"</p>

<p>"Hell," yelled the second man, almost plaintively, "I don't know. Mebbe six or seven, mebbe a dozen!"</p>

<p>"Goddam!" Hollingsworth spat. "Goddam!"</p>

<p>Niggers with guns. This shit was serious. Gotta get the cops in here to run 'em off.</p>

<p>"Joe Carl," he ordered, "Get on that police radio and tell 'em we need some deputies to run off these coons!"</p>

<p>Niggers with guns.</p>

<p>That was a different deal altogether.</p>

<p>Shit,
Hollingsworth thought. Even if the cops talk 'em into leaving, they'll 
take them two pointy-headed Yankee agitators with 'em.  I guess the 
fun's over for today.</p>

<p>Even so, the Klan stayed as the afternoon started to fade toward darkness.</p>

<p>But
the Kluxers now peered behind them into the deepening gloom, and 
wondered, "How many of these black bastards with guns are there?"</p>

<p>And another thought followed that swiftly, "Am I in their sights right now?"</p>

<p>Even
as the other men followed him across, Bobby Williams opened the back 
door at Andrey's and walked in past the cook, who took one look at the 
leveled M-1 rifle in the maintenance man's hands and grinned.</p>

<p>He'd
been ready to use his sawed off shotgun if the Kluxers had come into 
his place, but now he was off the hook. The Deacons were here.</p>

<p>Miller
saw Bobby out of the corner of his eye and just about dropped the 
phone. He knew they'd been guarded by armed men a couple of nights 
before when the Sheriff started floating a rumor that a white lynch mob 
was coming to hang him and Yates, and he recognized Bobby as one of the 
men who had been there. A feeling of total relief flooded through him. 
They would not die alone this day, beaten to a pulp even as their 
non-violent beliefs forbade them to fight back. These men would protect
him. It wasn't until later that he realized how hypocritical he was. 
One thing for sure, Miller thought, these guys know the drill.</p>

<p>After
a glance around the room, Bobby eased over to the front door, taking in
the enemy's dispositions with a series of peeks. His men silently 
arrayed themselves at each door and window, covering the streets outside
and each other. These guys have been there before, thought Miller.</p>

<p>The
white boy was still frightened though, and after realizing that help 
had arrived but the Klan wasn't going anywhere, he began feeding nickels
in the payphone again. He couldn't get a dial tone and he panicked.</p>

<p>"They cut off the phones!  They cut off the phones!" he shouted, looking at Booby and the other men.</p>

<p>"Son," said one, "you got to put a nickel in there first."</p>

<p>Miller
looked down. The white boy fished another nickel out of his pocket, 
tried it and got a dial tone. Sheepishly, he went back to calling the 
outside world.</p>

<p>"Reinforcements are here," called Bill Waverly 
from the back, and three more men entered. Bobby wasn't having any of 
that. There were too many men in here already.</p>

<p>"Look," he said 
quietly, reasonably, "there's too many folks in here already and we need
y'all to watch the perimeter and cover us from out there."</p>

<p>"Well, where do you want us?" one asked.</p>

<p>"C'mon," said Bobby, "I'll show you where to stand."</p>

<p>This
next part was a little dicey, Bobby knew. He didn't want the Klan to 
think they were pulling out, so he decided to ignore them.</p>

<p>He turned to the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Now follow me nice and slow and DON'T get ahead of me. Don't bunch up, but don't run, walk," he commanded.</p>

<p>The three newbies looked at each other and then nodded in unison.</p>

<p>Nervous as he was about what he was about to do, Bobby almost laughed. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"All, right," he commanded, "follow me."</p>

<p>Returning
the hold on his weapon to high port, Bobby Williams stepped out into 
the late afternoon and strolled back to the Aunt Sylvie's place. His 
reinforcements likewise gripped their weapons and followed like a gaggle
of baby ducks, two steps behind the man in front.</p>

<p>"Damn!" said a Kluxer to his buddy who was off to the side enough to see the procession, "Look at that shit."</p>

<p>When
he made the concealment at the edge of Aunt Sylvie's place, he began to
breathe again. One by one, the newbies joined him, out of sight now 
from the Kluxers. He looked around.</p>

<p>"OK," he pointed, "you, over
by that shed, you by the old jalopy over there and you," pointing to 
the man with another carbine, "you stay right here. Keep a three-sixty 
look out. Don't let nobody sneak up on you or on us. If anybody comes 
to firebomb the cafe, you kill 'em, you understand?"</p>

<p>They all nodded.</p>

<p>"You," he pointed to the man with the carbine.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"You know how to use that thing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I was in Korea later than you, but I was there. You ever hear of a place called Pork Chop Hill?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," grinned Bobby, "I heard of it."</p>

<p>He paused, looking down at the man's belt. "How many mags you got?"</p>

<p>"Six,
one in the carbine and four in here." He slapped the olive drab canvas
case on his belt. "And one more in my pocket. All thirties. 
Hardbacks. They'll work."</p>

<p>"OK," Bobby conceded with a grin, 
"you'll do. You be my squad leader out here. Anybody else shows up, 
you put 'em where they can cover over there," he pointed, "and over 
there," pointing over on the other side. "Don't let 'em get too far 
spread out but don't bunch 'em up either. I want you as a base of fire 
we can fall back on if it gets too hot up there," pointing at Andrey's 
Cafe.</p>

<p>He looked at his new corporal. "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Demmings."</p>

<p>"OK, Demmings, I'm countin' on you."</p>

<p>"Right, we ain't goin' anywhere."</p>

<p>"You
best not, or you'll have a helluva lot more than the Klan to worry 
about," Bobby said with a glower and then spoiled it by grinning.</p>

<p>Demmings grinned back.</p>

<p>"We'll be here."</p>

<p>"Oh,
yeah, one more thing. Can I have that extra mag you've got in your 
pocket? I got a man in there with a carbine who's a little light on 
ammo."</p>

<p>Demmings hestitated, then agreed. </p>

<p>"Sure," he said, handing the thirty rounder over, "Iffen you get killed, I'll just get it back from the Coroner afterward."</p>

<p>Bobby snorted. He'll do, he thought. And then he did something even harder than the first walk over.</p>

<p>He walked back.</p>

<p>He
stood to his full six feet two inches, slung his Garand like he was on 
the parade ground, and marched, yes marched, slowly back to Andrey's. 
Head erect, eyes straight, focused on a spot just about the back door. 
His old DI would have been proud. "Damn," said the Kluxer, "Look at 
that uppity nigger. LOOK at him."</p>

<p>None of the Kluxers who saw 
him as much as raised a muzzle. They were flabbergasted. THIS had 
NEVER happened before. It was beyond their experience. And it scared 
the excremental bejeezus out of each and every one of them.</p>

<p>Inside, the Deacons welcomed Bobby back in with a whoop and a holler.</p>

<p>"Damn,
boy!" exclaimed Joe Baker, "that was as cool as a cucumber in the deep 
shade. You damn near BEGGED them crackers to shoot you!"</p>

<p>Bobby grinned, and then turned serious.</p>

<p>"Get back on your windows and keep watch!"</p>

<p>But
secretly, deep in his gut, he smiled. The crackers were cowards. If 
they wouldn't shoot at him when he paraded like a tom turkey at a shoot,
they wouldn't when he could shoot back at them from cover. This was 
going to be all right. It wasn't over. But unless somebody really 
screwed this up by doing something stupid, it was going to be all right.</p>

<p>As
if to prove Bobby Williams right, by the time it got good and dark the 
frustrated Klan took counsel of their fears and drove off. But no one 
knew whether they had left any stay-behinds out there or not.</p>

<p>The Deacons kept watch, from Andrey's, the lights turned down low.</p>

<p>Maybe now is a good time to just let the history books tell it like it was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eventually
FBI Special Agent Frank Sass in New Orleans reached Miller on the pay 
phone in Andrey's. The Klan caravan circling the block had melted away 
at sunset, but it was still unsafe for Miller and Yates to leave the 
cafe. Agent Sass told Miller not to leave until Sass could come to 
Bogalusa and talk to local authorities.</p>

<p>Miller retorted that the
agent should not delay calling the Bogalusa officials; he and Yates 
needed protection immediately, and they had already notified the media. 
"The whole world is watching," Miller warned.</p>

<p>As
the resident agent for Bogalusa, Sass was familiar with the recent 
civil rights activities there. He soon arrived at Andrey's but balked 
at entering the building. "Steven Miller, come on out," yelled the 
agent in his distinctive southern drawl. One of the black guards 
cautioned Miller that the cafe door was illuminated by a light, making 
Miller a clear target if he ventured outside. "Don't go out there and 
silhouette yourself, boy," warned the man.</p>

<p>So Miller told Sass 
to come in if he wanted to talk. The FBI agent opened the door and took
a few steps inside. He was not prepared for the scene confronting him:
the tiny restaurant was packed with black men armed with rifles and 
shotguns.</p>

<p>"His mouth dropped a foot," remembered Miller with 
some amusement. "He literally couldn't talk for several minutes. He 
just stood there stunned."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sass left to go arrange for protection to get Yates to a hospital but Sass...
left without making any promises, saying only that he would speak
with the state police. The black guards waited a few hours for him to 
arrange protection, but when the agent failed to return they decided to 
move the CORE men to the home of Bob and Jackie Hicks. They concealed 
them in the back seat of a car and transported them in an armed convoy 
to the Hicks' house. When they arrived, Yates and Miller were greeted 
by a second defense force, scattered in trees, behind bushes and inside 
the house. </p>

<p>It was imperative to get Yates to a hospital so his 
injuries could be treated, but the local hospital was out of the 
question. By 10:30 PM CORE's regional office had arranged for a state 
police escort for Yates and Miller. Four patrol cars soon arrived at 
the Hicks' home. The ranking patrolman walked to the door. "He came 
in, took about four steps into the room, and saw all these guys with 
guns and his mouth fell open and he was rooted to the spot," said 
Miller. "He was just dumbfounded."</p>

<p>The armed guards relished the moment.</p>

<p>By
then, Bobby Williams had handed off his Garand and bandoleer to another
volunteer, caught a ride to his house, and hugged his wife again before
rushing off to the Crown-Zellerbach plant. He still had a shift to 
work, and he did it in the same dirty clothes he'd worn for two days.</p>

<p>Three days later, Lucy Williams presented Bobby with his third child, a boy. They named him Robert E. Williams, Jr.</p>

<p>In the fullness of time, he would become the first black Attorney General of the state of Alabama.</p>

<p>But that is another story.</p>

<i>
<p>(Author's
afterward: The chapter you have just read is properly described as 
"faction." There really was a "skirmish" at Andrey's Cafe on 3 February
1965. The events proceeded just as described. If I have taken some 
liberties with the names and precise actions of the men who would later 
form the Deacon for Defense and Justice chapter of Bogalusa, Louisiana, I
have, like Alan Eckhart in his "Wilderness" series of novels, merely 
given a best guess at dialogue to situations that are otherwise 
well-documented.</p>

<p>At this remove, we do not know exactly the 
names of those men first to the Cafe. Many more have claimed to be than 
could have fit in the tiny building. I have taken the liberty of 
inserting my fictional character Bobby Williams into this historical 
moment. Miller later reported that the men "moved with military 
precision."</p>

<p>Bobby Williams is not such an outlandish guess from
Miller's account. I would heartily recommend that anyone seeking the 
facts of the incident, or of the remarkable history of the Deacons 
themselves, should consult Lance Hill's history. It is an incredible 
story, and one that provides lessons even for today. -- MBV)</p>

<p>Will
Shipman and Tom Swenson slipped through the bars that blocked the mouth
of the old mine. They weren't bars really, not like you'd find in a 
jail or at the counter of the old Winston County Land Bank. These were 
rails, taken up from the double track that had serviced the big old 
mine, set into concrete and welded together like a porous scab across 
the massive stone entrance arch. The engraving in the capstone read 
"1918". It was hot outside and the cool beckoned them inward. Being 
young and skinny, they had no trouble getting through the narrow 
openings.</p>

<p>As they moved forward out of the sun's embrace into the
gloomy dark, they fished out their flashlights and carelessly began to 
explore. They'd never been in this mine, though they'd been told it was 
dangerous and they shouldn't go near it. Some said it was gassy with 
deadly methane. Some said it was haunted. The coal dust was probably two
or three inches deep under their feet and wet from condensation. It 
scrunched under their feet like black snow and clung to their shoes. The
main shaft seemed to go on into the mountain forever, but they'd only 
gone about a hundred and fifty yards or so when, unaccountably, they 
both halted.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the last ten yards or so, they'd lost 
their sense of adventure. Now they gripped their flashlights as tightly 
as they did their courage, and wildly shined them into the inky deep of 
the mine, illuminating... nothing. Yet, there WAS something. Will 
strained to hear and and see. No, there was nothing. Will and Tom held 
their breath, listening. No, Will thought, there was a BIG nothing. His 
hair stood up on end, and his flesh literally crawled, I mean CRAWLED, 
moving liquidly, spasmodically up his arms and legs, his muscles 
jerking.</p>

<p>A thought penetrated his fear and Will turned and 
flashed his light back down toward the way they'd come. There were two 
sets of footprints coming into the mine, his and Tom's. And, he realized
in a panic, nothing else. No critter tracks whatsoever. Not a squirrel 
or a racoon, not a bobcat. Nothing. There weren't even any spider webs. 
That was so far beyond his experience that he couldn't get his brain 
around it. Old mines always had critter tracks. Whatever was in here was
scary enough to keep all other living things out. All except us.</p>

<p>"Tom?"</p>

<p>"Y-yeah?" His best friend was frightened too.</p>

<p>"There ain't nothin' in here. This place is DEAD."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>And
so without another word between them they backed out, slowly. They 
didn't turn and run. As much as they wanted to, some primal instinct 
told them that if they turned their backs they were dead. So they faced 
the nothing and backed out to the bars, all one hundred and fifty yards.
Only when they were at the grate in the sunlight did they turn sideways
and wriggle through the bars.</p>

<p>And when Will Shipman was safe in the sunlight once more, he woke up.</p>

<p>Will
was sitting up in bed, drenched in sweat. "Oh, God," he groaned aloud. I
was back in Miller Mine. The sun shone in on him through the bedroom 
curtains. He ached all over. Will saw from the clock on the nightstand 
it was almost 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah. Charlie 
Quintard. The ATF. Moving his stash up to the cave. Charlie's war 
trophies. Stuck a thief's hand in a vise and dumped him in Smith Lake. 
Damn.</p>

<p>Will brought his right hand to his face and massaged his 
eyeballs, getting control of the memories and the nightmares, though 
where one ended and the other began, Will couldn't really say.</p>

<p>Miller
Mine. How long ago had that been? He was in high school then, he 
remembered. Why had he dreamed of that? Had Charlie's dank little cave 
triggered the memory? Or was it the bounty of the boxcar in another mine
that he knew he would soon have to do something about?</p>

<p>There 
was a loud bang out in the kitchen, like a big pan being dropped from 
about six feet onto the linoleum... Mary, being subtle again. She was 
back and wanted some answers. That was the opening gun of a marital 
skirmish, he knew from long experience. Will groaned again. So what 
excuse am I going to give her for being in bed at 3 in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Will
pivoted and put his feet over the side of the bed. Tentatively, every 
bone creaking and muscle screaming, he stood. Then he shambled off into 
the kitchen, going to face the music.</p>

<p>On his way he yawned, scratched his two-day growth of beard and complained to nobody in particular, "I'm too old for this crap."</p>

<hr/>

<p>The next day...</p>

<p>Charlie Quintard eased up to the cache point, all his senses straining.</p>

<p>A
bank covered with kudzu only twenty yards from a logging road, it 
contained a fifty-five gallon plastic barrel that had been sunk sideways
into it back in the 90s. The drum had a carefully-crafted wooden lid 
that friction fit into the top, the surface of which appeared to be a 
sideways view of a rotted log. Only a close-up inspection would have 
revealed the preservatives it had been soaked in to keep the insects 
away. Despite its proximity to the road, the folds of the ground made it
invisible to passing vehicles, not that there was much traffic these 
days. Five yards away from the kudzu-shielded drum, a random stick 
protruded up from the bank, just like a flag on a mailbox.</p>

<p>Charlie
grinned. "You've got mail," he mimicked the old AOL voice. He pulled 
the stick out of the ground and laid it down, then moved to the lid, 
brushing away the kudzu vines that draped over it. Removing the lid, he 
pulled the M-1945 GI packboard out with its lashed-on cargo and dropped 
it down the bank, watching it roll gently through the kudzu. Taking a 
plastic baggie out of his pocket, he put his letter to Will in the drum 
and carefully replaced the lid. Rearranging the vines until he was 
satisfied no one could tell they had been disturbed, Charlie carefully 
worked his way down the bank, his mocassined feet eluding the entangling
kudzu.</p>

<p>Once down, he shouldered the heavy packboard and made his
way back to the cave, stopping periodically to cover what few tracks he
left. Regaining his new home away from home, he dropped down on the 
camp bed he'd crafted from limbs and ropes and began to explore the 
mysteries of the packboard by electric lantern, almost as excited as a 
kid at Christmas.</p>

<p>Toilet paper! Thank the Lord. And prunes for 
regularity. Vitamins. A very complete yet compact first aid with 
instruction book. Cyalume sticks. A pump flashlight that didn't require 
batteries. A couple of portable camp lamps with extra six volt 
batteries. Mountain House freeze dried food. Spices. Dried fruit. Four 
dozen MRE heaters. No MREs, thank God, but he could use the heaters to 
heat other food and himself. The cave was dank, and Charlie already 
hated it.</p>

<p>And books, wrapped in ziplock bags. A field manual on 
the Ingram MAC-10. A field guide to herbs and edible plants of the 
Southeastern US. A paperback Complete Collection of Sherlock Holmes and 
The Unabridged Mark Twain. Bless you, Will Shipman. In the rush to move 
the food, Charlie had left almost all of his library behind, grabbing 
only his pocket Bible and his favorite book of Cherokee culture and 
history. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sam Clemens would do in a pinch, 
though.</p>

<p>A small arms cleaning kit with a variety of brushes and 
jags, several hundred patches, pipe cleaners, cleaning rags, bore 
cleaner, grease and gun oil, all in individual gallon ziplock bags. 
Xeroxed field-stripping instructions on the types of weapons Charlie had
in his trophy collection, with hand-written addenda on packaging the 
firearms for long term storage. Trash bags.</p>

<p>Waterless 
handcleanser and shampoo! Charlie might be a self-taught backwoodsman, 
but that didn't mean he had to stink like an 18th century Cherokee 
brave. Unscented too. Good thinking, Will.</p>

<p>Space blankets. A GI 
poncho and liner. A sewing kit. More handwritten instructions in a 
ziplock bag. A handheld radio with extra batteries and more instructions
on how to communicate with Will in an emergency. Something in a black 
paper cylinder with metal caps on both ends, heavy, with tape going 
round the center holding the container together. In faded letters, it 
read "M-15, Smoke, WP."</p>

<p>And a letter, and a map.</p>

<p>"Dear Charlie,</p>

<p>This
ought to get you started. You're going to want to stick around the cave
for the next few weeks as much as possible. At least a hundred ATF 
raided your cabin the afternoon of the day we moved you out. They're 
starting to search the lake too. I don't know what if anything they 
found. They know it was you because they're offering a $50,000 reward 
for information on your whereabouts. Don't worry though. They never did 
find that asshole Eric Robert Rudolph with all their technology. A local
cop did that for them after they'd pretty much given up..."</p>

<p>Charlie
grunted. That was cold comfort to him. Besides, they'd had ten years 
and two wars to improve their technological wizardry, hadn't they? He 
knew that from the Popular Science and Popular Mechanics magazines he'd 
read in the library. Charlie continued reading.</p>

<p>"... We're 
going to have to be careful as well about resupplying you with the 
caches until I get a better handle on how they're looking for you. Read 
the instructions I put with the radio and use only the click protocol I 
have given you at the times and frequencies indicated. Only speak over 
the radio if you have to break cover and escape and evade and then keep 
it short. Use the code words I have provided. If I need to get you a 
message or have more supplies for you at one of the cache sites, I'll 
use the click method too. Again, consult the protocol for times and 
frequencies of when to listen.</p>

<p>I've selected three possible 
pickup points if we need to get you out in a hurry. They are marked on 
the enclosed topo map as A, B &amp; C. A is the best I think. It's the
closest to you. It leads away from the bigger road which is likely to 
have more traffic, and the old logging and mining roads and abandoned 
railroad beds crisscross so that multiple vehicle escape routes are 
possible in case one or more is blocked. I've penciled in some of them 
that aren't on the map, but you probably know the area better than I do.
 And in case we have to abandon the vehicle, or we miss connections on 
the pickup, I have marked rally points, W, X, Y and Z which are 
reachable on foot in less than four hours. We will use the following 
click code for each of these...</p>

<p>Charlie skipped down to the last.</p>

<p>We'll get through this.</p>

<p>God be with you Charlie."</p>

<p>It was unsigned.</p>

<p>At the bottom there was a PS, "Burn this after memorizing."</p>

<p>Charlie sighed. This Batcave crap was already old and he was lonely beyond any experience. He sure missed Pushmataha.</p>

<p>He
moved to the cave mouth and sat down in the warm light of day. Charlie 
Quintard basked in the sun and took what comfort he could from it and 
from the tangible proof of the friendship and assistance of Will 
Shipman. He hoped it would be enough. He was alive and he intended to 
stay alive, if for no other reason than to wreak more vengeance on the 
ATF for the deaths of Phil Gordon and Pushmataha. Tonight, he would read
The Hound of the Baskervilles, and dream of old times, better times, 
with Push.<br>__________________________________</p>

<p>One week after the skirmish at the old Gordon place...</p>

<p>Barton
Meigs hated having to rely on and worse, trust, John Claxton and his 
Brightfire mercenaries, but the ATF regional boss had to admit that 
Claxton had the ability to put his hands on technology that Meigs could 
have only dreamed about.</p>

<p>By now, Meigs knew the name of the 
"person of interest" in the disappearance of ten of his agents -- 
Charlie Quintard. They still hadn't found any bodies, but a thorough 
search of the Gordon cabin and its approaches had turned up evidence of a
firefight.</p>

<p>This time, Meigs had sent 163 federal agents and 
Brightfire mercenaries by helicopter, boat and Humvee in a coordinated 
assault. They came up empty-handed but at least none of them had 
disappeared in the process. The same could not be said for Charlie 
Quintard. They had found a small grave, but dug up only a dead dog. 
Ballistics said it was an agency weapon that killed it. We lost ten 
agents and he lost a dog, Meigs mused bitterly. Bad trade.</p>

<p>Strangely,
the only recent brass the forensics unit had found was from his agent's
guns, and none that could be said to be from their presumed assailants.
Quintard had to have had help, Meigs figured. No one untrained man 
could take out four to six men at a time. He might have got the first 
team unawares, but surely the second team had come in wary and loaded 
for bear.</p>

<p>After all, the Indian was a burned-out computer geek 
hermit, not Rambo. At least that's what the profilers said. He hadn't 
had any military training. Hell, he'd never been in trouble with the law
at all until this. Quintard had done mountain-man-rendezvous 
Walter-Mitty kind of stuff, but that was about all they knew. Those 
familiar with him had been uniformly closed mouthed about the Indian. 
The local post office personnel all had amnesia. Even the nice lady 
librarian had told them to go to Hell in words that had shocked the 
patrons who witnessed it. Quintard's fellow Cherokee had been 
particularly surly, ordering Meigs' agents off their property at 
gunpoint in two cases. That had been a close run thing. Meigs couldn't 
afford to lose any more agents.</p>

<p>So he's got friends and 
accomplices. He's had help and he'll continue to get it. He's probably 
living in a cave up there like that prick Rudolph in North Carolina back
in the 90s, only no deputy sheriff was going to turn this guy in if he 
caught him rooting around in a trash can. And Quintard probably wouldn't
be reduced to dumpster diving. Meigs had no doubt that Quintard could 
get a lot more help than Rudolph had if the people of Winston County 
only knew where the Charlie Quintard Charity Donation Box was.</p>

<p>We,
on the other hand, will get no help from the locals and none that we 
can trust from either the county sheriff or the state. The IRS had been 
helpful with the name of a Winston County deputy who had tax problems, 
but even with him on the payroll they'd learned nothing about the 
whereabouts of Quintard, nor much about the few friends who might have 
helped him. They had learned a great deal about how unwilling the 
Sheriff was to get in the middle of this, though. I'll get to that 
pusillanimous bastard one day. But not now. It was simply a matter of 
priorities.</p>

<p>The mystery of the bodies was another thing. The lake
seemed a logical place but it was so BIG an area to search. They'd used
sonar searches and contract divers in the area immediately offshore of 
the Gordon cabin to no result. They were still searching, but the 
hydro-geologist and the search team leader, after consulting their 
respective crystal balls and comparing notes, didn't hold out much hope 
of a quick find because of all the deep dips and folds in the lake 
bottom. Each would have to be identified and explored without much help 
from the machines.</p>

<p>A ransom demand had been recieved, purporting 
to be from the kidnapper of his missing agents. But they had quickly 
traced it to an opportunistic petty criminal in Jasper, Alabama who 
would likely be spending the next twenty years in federal prison. No, 
they were dead, Meigs was sure of it. But where?</p>

<p>Still, as 
important as finding the bodies was, finding Quintard was more 
important. Trying to limit the Indian's access to help, Meigs had the 
entire Bankhead National Forest area officially shut down. There were no
longer any of the thousands of innocent visitors to the area who 
normally would have roamed the forest. But it wasn't that simple, Meigs 
knew. There were thousands more people whose homes were scattered 
throughout the general area, intermingled with federal property. Meigs 
didn't have the authority to dispossess them, as much as he wanted to. 
There were simply too many people who had a right to be where Barton 
Meigs didn't want them to be, and he knew that some of them had to be 
helping Quintard. In addition, it was hard to sort them out from the 
visitors who didn't have a right to be there.</p>

<p>For now, the ATF 
was searching vehicles at random roadblocks and carrying out searches of
nearby homes on a federal judge's blanket warrant which Meigs was 
certain would never survive legal challenge. These clumsy efforts were 
making a great many innocent people very angry to no purpose. If they 
ever did spot Quintard now, Meigs knew, they were hardly likely to turn 
him over to the ATF.</p>

<p>He had, to the chagrin of the Forest 
Service, flooded the area with "undercover" agents in brand new park 
ranger uniforms but they fooled nobody with their city slicker 
clumsiness. Their ranger trucks had already begun turning up with "ATF" 
or "Gun Gestapo" spray painted on the tailgates and "pin the tail on the
Fed" was a new and thoroughly enjoyed past time of Winston County 
teenagers.</p>

<p>But this, Barton Meigs hoped, just might work. This 
time, Brightfire had impressed him. The remotely piloted surveillance 
blimp swung gently in the breeze from its portable pylon which had been 
erected on the tarmac of the old World War Two vintage airstrip in 
southern Tennessee, hard by the Alabama state line. Meigs had 
commandeered it from the owner of the defunct flying school who had last
used it, by making him a deal on his considerable tax trouble which had
been discovered only this week.</p>

<p>New chainlink fences and barbed 
wire were still being installed along the perimeter, and the old guard 
shack and dilapidated quonset huts were even now being bulldozed to make
way for a modern hardened entrance and a large hanger. Command and 
control of the blimp would be accomplished from the trailer which now 
sat about a hundred yards from the pylon and living areas for the 
Brightfire pilots, maintenance crew and security detail were being 
hauled into place as he stood amidst the cacophony of construction noise
and blowing dust. They were mostly old FEMA trailers, Meigs saw, but 
they would serve. At least I don't have to live in them.</p>

<p>It was 
good that they'd found this spot in Tennessee, Meigs reflected. 
Relations with the state authorities in Alabama were already poisonous 
and getting worse. Alabama Bureau of Investigation agents were shadowing
his own all throughout the state now, ordered to do so by a pissant, 
holier-than-thou governor would had been "offended" by the "federal 
misconduct" at the Battle of Sipsey Street. As unwise as Barton Meigs 
agreed that operation had been (he still cursed his predecessor's memory
daily), he had no patience for state governors who acted bigger than 
their britches and didn't understand their place in the federal 
universe. To hell with him, Meigs swore. We'll find this cop killer 
without the Governor of Alabama and all his dickless ABI men. And if he 
gets in my way enough, maybe I'll get the opportunity to arrest HIS ass.</p>

<p>Who knows? Maybe after we get Quintard, I'll use this to spy on HIM.</p>

<p>The
blimp swung with the breeze again and brought him out of his reverie. 
Damn, Meigs thought, this is bigger than I thought it would be from the 
briefings. The blimp was almost 200 feet long, with three fins at the 
rear and a gondola containing the state-of-the art detection equipment. 
It had an operational ceiling of 15,000 feet and a top speed of 60 miles
an hour. Two of them would operate from this base, maintaining a 24-7 
surveillance of Quintard's potential hiding places.</p>

<p>Of course 
this wasn't like Iraq or Afghanistan and there were lots of restrictions
the FAA had put on the deployment of these Brightfire airships. Some 
air lanes had to be shifted and the airspace over Winston County was put
off limits to civilian aviation, except police and fire helicopters and
even THEY had to get his permission before they lifted off. The phone 
call he'd had from the chairman of the local airport authority down 
there had been memorable. The man had cussed him for six minutes and 
fifty-two seconds and if he repeated himself even once, Barton Meigs 
hadn't noticed it. The ATF regional director had thought that his 
father was the champion cusser of all time. Now, he shook his head at 
the depths of his ignorance. The airport authority guy had been an 
Olympic champion athlete of the profane and obscene. Meigs was still 
amazed.</p>

<p>Still, Meigs, thought with satisfaction, if we can't get 
him with this, we aren't trying hard enough. The Brightfire techs had 
told him about the problems created for the sensors by the dense tree 
canopy in parts of the forest, and they certainly couldn't see 
underground into a cave. But experience told Meigs that Charlie Quintard
would have to be moving outside of his lair sometime. And when he does,
we'll have him. Maybe then we can close the Gordon case for good.</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Or, maybe not.</p>

<p>That
same afternoon, Will Shipman looked up from his desk at the marina 
office to see a tall, lean older fellow pull up on a Harley outside the 
bay window which fronted the restaurant parking lot across the way. He 
looked vaguely familiar but Will couldn't immediately place him. He had a
folding rod and a fishing creel strapped to the back of his bike, but 
instead of walking into the restaurant he headed back across the parking
lot for the marina office door.</p>

<p>When the older man hit the door 
and made a bee-line past Shaunna at the front desk toward Will, Shipman 
knew he wasn't a fisherman. Where have I seen him before? He racked his 
brain. Even when the man extended his hand and told him his name, Will 
still couldn't place him.</p>

<p>"Hi, Will, I'm Jack Durer." He waited, 
and then seeing not a spark of recognition in Will Shipman's eyes he 
offered, "We have a mutual acquaintance, Kraut Mueller."</p>

<p>Will 
shook his hand, the old memory moving up from the dim recesses of his 
brain. "Kraut? When, no wait, I remember, give me a second. The meeting 
at John Brassey's place. When was it, '95?"</p>

<p>"June of '96," Durer replied.</p>

<p>"You worked for the state then, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah,
but that was a long time ago. I'm retired now and up here to do some 
fishin'. Got any suggestions?" As he spoke, he nodded toward the back 
door. Will took the hint.</p>

<p>"Sure, I've got a map of the lake posted on the back porch. Let me show you."</p>

<p>They
walked out back to the porch, which was connected to the dock by a pine
board stairway. Will started to show him the map of Smith Lake, but 
Jack squeezed his shoulder and guided him toward the stairs, and the 
dock. Will complied and together they walked down to the marina dock.</p>

<p>"You rent boats?"</p>

<p>"Sure, it's my biggest money maker next to being a guide."</p>

<p>"That's the ticket. Let me hire you for a couple of hours. How much?"</p>

<p>Will told him, and Jack nodded with a merry grin on his face. He didn't even try to dicker like most out-of-towners.</p>

<p>"That'll be fine. You got a boat, I guess?"</p>

<p>Will thought he was pulling his leg. "Yeah, a couple three."</p>

<p>"You got somebody else's boat we can use?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Uh, yeah. We can take that one down there," Will pointed. "It's here for maintenance and just came out of the shop."</p>

<p>"Know the guy it belongs to?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah."</p>

<p>"Live around here?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Where was this going?</p>

<p>"A friend?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly."</p>

<p>Durer nodded. "OK, let's take that one."</p>

<p>"You going to go get your rod?"</p>

<p>"No. You've got some rental tackle don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Well, go get it and put it on the bill. We're burning daylight."</p>

<p>Five
minutes later, after telling Shaunna he'd be with a customer for a 
couple hours, Will conned the borrowed boat around the point and out of 
sight of the marina. Jack Durer hadn't said another word in the interim,
until now.</p>

<p>"Blind Squaw Cove is just ahead, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, how did you know that?"</p>

<p>"I
can read a topo map," Jack said with a grin. "It's pretty private 
place, isn't it? Not close to the road, steep cliff straight up from the
lake, but with a shelf of overhanging vegetation?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you didn't get that from a topo map."</p>

<p>"No, Google Earth." He paused. "Let's head there."</p>

<p>Another
five minutes and they were there, sheltered under the trees. A water 
mocassin plopped out of one with a splash and undulated away in search 
of warm water and Alabama sushi.</p>

<p>Will Shipman waited. This was Durer's show.</p>

<p>"Let's fish while we chat a bit."</p>

<p>"OK."</p>

<p>Out came the rods and reels. The hooks were baited, lines cast.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Mr. Durer, but we didn't bring any beer."</p>

<p>"That's OK, Will, this is business. And call me Jack."</p>

<p>"Business?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Serious business." The older man paused. "You know you've got ATF surveillance all over your ass, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've spotted a few of them, but not consistently."</p>

<p>"Look harder next time, and EVERY time, they're there."</p>

<p>"Where are they now, back at the marina?"</p>

<p>"No,
they're chasing a wild goose they think is named Charlie Quintard. I 
know because some of my old ABI boys pointed them in the wrong direction
at my request. Charlie is their number one priority. You're their 
second priority."</p>

<p>"Why me?"</p>

<p>"Don't kid a kidder, Will, and
don't try to act the fool, or play me for one. I'm the best friend you 
have in the whole wide pea-pickin' world right now and that includes 
your wife Mary."</p>

<p>Durer saw the darkening look on Will Shipman's 
face. "Don't get pissed son. I really am here to help you. In fact, I 
need you as much as you need me."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Let me 
answer your question first. You're their second priority because they 
think you can lead them to Charlie Quintard. They think you know where 
he is. Point of fact, so do I. I'm even more convinced of it than they 
are thanks to the disinformation we're dishin' out to 'em with both 
hands."</p>

<p>"Uh huh. So, even if I did, which I'm not sayin' I do, you want to know where he's at, huh?"</p>

<p>Durer
let out a belly laugh. "Lord, NO, son. If you tried to tell me now, I'd
plug my ears and sing 'Dixie' at the top of my lungs. I want to make 
sure that boy is NEVER found. Not by the likes of the ATF. But if he is 
found, I want to make sure that its much more later than sooner. I need 
to buy some time, a couple months would be good, six months would be 
better."</p>

<p>"And that's how I can help you? How's that?"</p>

<p>"Well,
you won't be helpin' me, exactly. I'll get by whether Charlie Quintard 
goes down tomorrow or becomes a mysterious legend who disappeared like 
smoke and was never seen again. Who we'll both be helping is the 
Governor."</p>

<p>"The Governor?" Will Shipman was as puzzled as he sounded.</p>

<p>"Yeah.
Look Will. I was friends with Phil Gordon too. The Governor had no idea
what the ATF was about to do him, although they'd asked for DPS 
assistance that day with traffic control and the like. But they gave us 
no warning of what they had up their sleeves or who their target was. 
The whole thing was as big a shock to the Governor as anybody else and 
now he's stuck with having to deal with the consequences." Durer 
paused. "What do you think of the Governor?"</p>

<p>Will Shipman 
reflected for a moment. "Well, I voted for him. He struck me as the most
honest, principled and incorruptible man as ever held the office. 
'Course in Alabama that ain't sayin' much," he grinned. "I think he's an
upright Christian man and we'll never have a better leader in 
Montgomery."</p>

<p>Durer smiled. "You're right. But more importantly we
couldn't have a better man in this crisis that the ATF's madness had 
put us all in. This country is about to finally come apart, you know 
that don't you?"</p>

<p>Will nodded and Durer continued. "The Governor 
believes, and I do too, that the only hope for the country to stay 
together is to get everyone to agree that the old scheme of federalism 
where the states get to decide more of their own future is the way to 
go. But the administration and the bureaucracy, hell, even a slim 
majority of the American people, don't see it that way. Especially the 
new President."</p>

<p>Will again nodded.</p>

<p>"What the Governor 
wants to try is the Doctrine of Interposition to see if he can get the 
Feds to back off some. Ever heard of it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I read a lot 
about it when Chief Justice Moore was trying to stop the ACLU and the 
Feds from removing the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Supreme Court. 
Didn't do him any good. That RINO Governor Riley stabbed him in the 
back."</p>

<p>"Right," agreed Durer. "But has it occurred to you that 
Ray Marsh IS the Governor now? And that he's got the backing of the 
Attorney General, not to mention a majority of the people in the state, 
black and white?"</p>

<p>Will nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"In addition, where 
Judge Roy Moore had public opinion on his side but not much else, Ray 
Marsh has most of the levers of state power in his hands and the brains 
to work them. He's ten times smarter than any other politician in the 
state with the possible exception of the Attorney General. Robert 
Williams, Junior has a mind like greased lightning along with a Harvard 
Law degree."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know that's right."</p>

<p>"There has never
been a better time or place to try to stop the federal leviathan than 
right here and right now. And Ray Marsh is the fellow to do it. What he 
doesn't need right now is any more complications, like the ATF making 
another martyr out of Charlie Quintard and starting a shooting war that 
spreads like a wildfire across the country."</p>

<p>Will thought for moment and then asked, "You're saying that Governor Marsh sent you?"</p>

<p>Jack
Durer smiled. "No, not exactly. In fact he doesn't know I'm here nor 
will he know if I can help it. Let's say that I'm anticipating him 
wanting me to be here, if he actually knew what was happening in Winston
County at the moment, which he doesn't."</p>

<p>"So," said Will Shipman slowly, "You want me to take your word for all this without proof?"</p>

<p>"What's proof?" Jack snapped. "Have I said anything that contradicts reality as you understand the present situation?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Will.</p>

<p>"And if the Governor can hold the line against the Feds, maybe push them back a bit, then that's a good thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"And it would be a good thing if the ATF never gets their hands on Charlie Quintard?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Absolutely."</p>

<p>"And you're willing to help me make that happen?"</p>

<p>Will was silent for a while and then said, "Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"OK," Jack Durer said, "You wanted proof, here it is. Have you ever met Barton Miegs?"</p>

<p>"No, but I know who he is. The papers say he's heading the search for Charlie."</p>

<p>"He
is that, and a lot more. He's the new ATF Regional Director. Works out 
of Nashville. And he's ten times smarter than the idiot who got himself 
killed going after Phil Gordon. He's not a bad sort for a federal gun 
cop, but that ain't saying much. He'll still do his damnedest to catch 
Charlie, and you, if he thinks you're helping him. And he won't shed 
many tears if you're both killed in the process. Think of Meigs as your 
opposite number, the OPFOR commander. You're going to have to get crawl 
inside his skull and mess with his decision cycle. Him and the 
Brightfire mercenary commander who's been tapped to help him, John 
Claxton."</p>

<p>"They're using mercenaries against us? Against Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Hell,
yeah," said Jack Durer with a grim laugh, "Phil Gordon just about wiped
out their personnel roster around here, if you hadn't noticed. They had
to get thug replacements from somewhere, and Brightfire and other 
companies like them are it. The word I get is that they'll get no 
assistance from the services on this, at least not until they fire the 
current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and about fifteen or twenty other 
generals and admirals. The administration isn't prepared to take the 
heat on THAT yet, thank the Lord. And until they do, the Army won't 
fight our own people over gun ownership. Plain and simple. And if they 
did, the President couldn't be certain which way some of them would 
point their guns. So its Brightfire and mercenary companies like them 
and the federal police agencies including, of course, the ATF."</p>

<p>Jack Durer reached inside his windbreaker and pulled out a pad and pen, handing them to Will.</p>

<p>"Here,"
he said, "you're going to need to take notes because there's a lot to 
cover and no time to repeat myself. Make notes of what I'm about to tell
you, commit them to memory as soon as you can and then burn them."</p>

<p>From
his other pocket, Durer produced some xeroxed sheets in a ziplock bag. 
"You'll need to do the same with this after you transcribe and encrypt 
it. You can't possibly memorize all of this data, but find a safe place 
to hold onto the copes you make, NOT, I repeat NOT, on any property that
is your own."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"A complete T.O.&amp; E. of 
both the ATF regional structure and the Brightfire elements tasked to 
assist them. Names, addresses, intentions of the enemy as near as we can
determine. Sterile transcription copies, no one will ever trace them. 
Some photographs of principal enemy personnel."</p>

<p>Will raised his eyebrow at that. "ENEMY personnel?"</p>

<p>Jack
Durer looked at Will Shipman with an impatient intensity that said he 
was examining the curves and nuances of the younger man's spinal 
vertebrae and judging them to be slightly substandard. Will almost 
wilted under the gaze. Damn, this guy is scary. Another thought 
intruded: He's killed before, with his own hands, up close. He started 
to say something, but Durer beat him to it.</p>

<p>"You got a better 
description?" the older man demanded. "This is a war THEY launched upon
the citizens of their OWN country, which includes YOU. If they aren't 
your enemies BY THEIR OWN HANDS," Durer snapped out the words like 
gunshots, "then I don't know what that word means. It's mostly a cold 
war right now -- God help us to keep it a cold war -- but its a war. Get
used to it," Durer finished brutally.</p>

<p>Will cleared his throat. "Right," he said huskily.</p>

<p>"If
this," Will said as he brandished the thick wad of sheets in the 
ziplock bag, "is that complete, then what do I need to take notes for?"</p>

<p>"That,"
pointing at the pen and notebook, "is for what I couldn't easily put 
down in writing, as well as communications security stuff for contacting
me. You must be familiar with some fieldcraft or the ATF would have had
you both by now."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Will agreed, "some, but obviously not enough if I couldn't make all of my ATF tail."</p>

<p>"You don't contact Charlie directly?"</p>

<p>"Lord,
no," Will replied. "I've got both dead and live drops I use. Trusted 
friends who service the cache sites. Charlie has a radio I gave him with
a CEOI for an emergency, but I pray God he never has to use it."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Durer, "me too." He paused. "OK, write this down."</p>

<p>When
he got to the part about the Brightfire RPV surveillance blimps, Will 
interjected, "What!?! How are we supposed to beat that?"</p>

<p>"Will, 
Kraut Mueller once told me that if he had to pick anybody to watch his 
flank it would be you. He said you're experienced, bright and 
resourceful. Plus you know your own AO better than anybody else."</p>

<p>Shipman could feel the smoke being blown up his back passage.</p>

<p>"But HOW?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"I
don't know, but I have every confidence you'll figure it out. And 
you'll have to do it in such a way as to avoid having your fingerprints,
or those of any of your friends, on the job."</p>

<p>"Right," sneered Will.</p>

<p>"Look,"
said Durer, "these RPVs, whether they're Predators or blimps, aren't 
infallible. Everybody's seen the images of Osama walking in the middle 
of his entourage in the dark of night. Looks impressive. But you know 
what they didn't have in that footage?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"TREES. 
Look around, Will, what do you see here? Some of this is double canopy 
stuff, especially up in the Sipsey Wilderness. Thick vegetation hinders 
the imaging of these things, even the thermal sensors. You can alter 
Charlie's thermal image as well, using space blankets sewn inside a 
hooded poncho."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Will, "I'd heard of that and 
Charlie has the makings of one right now. If he did what I asked in the 
instructions, he's already put it together."</p>

<p>"Good," Jack said with evident approval, and then continued.</p>

<p>"Plus,
the biggest challenge with these imaging systems is expert 
interpretation and that's one thing that Brightfire and the ATF haven't 
yet achieved on their own and won't. In fact, the biggest secret of our 
own military's success with these things is the interpretation that's 
done at a top-secret Air Force installation on the backside of Maxwell 
Air Force Base in Montgomery. They don't fly 'em, they don't maintain 
'em. All they do is interpret little electronic squiggles into clues of 
enemy personnel and operations. And they are the best at what they do in
the entire world. But as I said, they're not going to be working on the
ATF's little Winston County problem. If they were, you'd be dead 
already."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a cheery thought," said Will. "Let's hope they stay on the sidelines."</p>

<p>"Getting
back to dealing with this Brightfire blimp, you can also give the thing
many other targets to confuse it, some of them I've listed in the 
packet. Finally, you can go after either the vehicle as it flies or the 
ground control station, but only as a last resort, and only if you can 
guarantee zero enemy casualties in the process and only if you don't get
your fingerprints on it."</p>

<p>"That's a hell of a tall order."</p>

<p>"I
know, so shut up and soldier. Tomorrow, a customer in your restaurant 
is going to leave a book underneath the last booth on the right, the one
with the broken footboard. Retrieve it when you total the receipts at 
the end of the day as you usually do."</p>

<p>"And I was going to get 
that fixed," Will shook his head with a sad grin. "Is there anything 
about me that you don't know about?"</p>

<p>Jack Durer looked at him 
kindly. "Very little. Unlike the ATF, I don't have your phones, your 
house and your business wiretapped." Will looked at him sharply. "What I
DO have, is an informant in the ATF section who monitors all of those, 
and Kraut Mueller's and those of a half dozen other names you would 
probably recognize."</p>

<p>"OK, so we're going to use the book as a cipher system?" Will volunteered.</p>

<p>"Right,"
said Jack, "Go to the head of the class. Its not foolproof, and there 
are computers at Langley that could still crack it given enough time, 
but where the CIA and the NSA stand in all of this is by no means 
certain. The struggle for the hearts and minds of the spooks goes on. 
What we're hoping is to postpone any decision making time on their part 
until after Alabama has had a chance to implement the Governor's gambit.
That's more information than you need to know, but it may help you 
understand that on this the federal government is by no means the New 
World Order monolith portrayed in the paranoid ether." Durer paused.</p>

<p>"You'll like the book though," he said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because
its a limited edition reminiscence and history of Winston County in the
19th Century. Only a hundred copies ever printed and fewer than twenty 
identified as still in existence."</p>

<p>"You mean..."</p>

<p>"Yep. 
Told you you'd like it. Don't let out a war whoop when you 'accidentally
find it cleaning up.' Remember, the whole place is bugged."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>"OK, let's continue with the notebook."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>"The ATF has a deputy in the Winston County Sheriff's Department, his name is..."</p>

<p>For
about an hour, Will Shipman scribbled notes, asking questions, getting 
answers sometimes, sometimes getting questions back in return. What did 
he think? How would he deal with this contigency or that? Part of it, 
Will came to realize, was Jack Durer testing him, feeling him out, 
pointing him in the right direction, motivating him. Will started to 
tell Durer about the boxcar, but backed off. Concentrate on the subject 
at hand. Durer, and the Governor, have enough to worry about right now.</p>

<p>Somewhere
in that long period of writer's cramp on the gently rocking boat, Jack 
Durer made an observation that caught Will Shipman's imagination. "There
are going to be a lot of people in Winston County who won't like the 
cover being ripped off their business for everyone else to see. Some of 
them will be in a position to do something about it." Will knew his 
county and his people as well or better than anyone. He knew that Jack 
Durer was absolutely right about that. He even came up with a name, but 
he did not speak it. Let's think on that a bit, he told himself.</p>

<p>Durer
was back on his Harley and headed southeast by the time the ATF agents 
got back from their goose chase. He had even paid the bill with cash. 
Insisted on it, in fact.</p>

<p>Will Shipman was now convinced that, 
with Jack Durer's help, he could keep the ATF and their mercenary 
minions spinning. But what to do about the blimps? He was still thinking
on it when he went to sleep that night. About two o'clock in the 
morning, he sat straight up in bed out of a sound sleep and knew without
a doubt how he was going to do this. He just had to have a little 
patience and let human nature take its course.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mary murmured.</p>

<p>"Nothing honey," he replied softly, laying back down. "Nothing at all."</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
blimps had been flying for almost a month now and what they'd found was
impressive. Marijuana fields, meth labs, cock fights, dog fights, 
whiskey stills, a counterfeiting operation, the recently disturbed soil 
of graves containing four dead bodies, the parson of a local Methodist 
congregation dallying with the church secretary, and twenty one possums 
with IR thermal imitators strapped to them.</p>

<p>The last gag was the 
idea of a senior in the International Baccalaureate School of Shades 
Valley near Birmingham. Possums being rather territorial even when 
transplanted from one place to another, with electronic help they had 
successfully imitated a human with a ninety eight point six temperature 
moving in and out of dark, tight spaces and down to water, out to food 
and searching for dates.</p>

<p>When caught, the senior insisted that it
was all in pursuit of a winning science fair project, and though he 
advanced to the state finals, he was unable to accept the college 
scholarship he earned for he was still being held for questioning when 
the fall semester commenced. Legal wiggle room for such detentions was 
discovered in the latest iteration of the PATRIOT Act, and there was a 
lot of the Fourth Amendment that just wasn't there any more. Since such 
laws were now being used against their enemies, the so-called liberal 
civil libertarians didn't give a rip. Those who did mostly stayed quiet 
out of fear of being detained themselves.</p>

<p>Barton Meigs estimated 
the lost man hours in the tens of thousands and there was still no sign 
of Charlie Quintard. The reward was boosted to a half million, then a 
million. Still nothing. No bodies either. Dead Man's Holler remained an 
undiscovered country to the ATF and Charlie Quintard was still its only 
tour guide.</p>

<p>Not that he got around much anymore.</p>

<p>Pinned to
his cave, Charlie was so sick of it, so stressed by being alone, so 
heartsick at the loss of Pushmataha that some mornings he awoke in his 
dank prison with thoughts of suicide on his mind. He memorized Sherlock 
Holmes. He memorized Mark Twain. He memorized the Bible and came to a 
new appreciation of all of three works. To stay sane, he overruled his 
initial resistance and took out his frustration by practicing with the 
MAC-10 and its sound suppressor in the back recesses of the cave. He got
to be very, very good with it, despite the fact that twice he was 
nearly killed by ricochets and once a deflected slug blew apart one of 
his scat sacks and the cave filled with the smell of ordure until he got
it repackaged.</p>

<p>His food was holding out, though he was running 
low on toilet paper, waterless shampoo, cyalume sticks and batteries. He
stayed fit by exercising in the flat back hall of the cave. But his 
nerves were shot. He made friends with a field mouse that wandered into 
his home, feeding it so it returned time and again. He dubbed it Mickey 
and though it was the only social interaction he had, it was a poor 
substitute for Pushmataha. Lord, he missed that dog. Will had sent word 
that there was a surveillance blimp overhead and to be extremely 
cautious about keeping under the trees as much as possible.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In
the wider world, the ATF and the federal leviathan it served were under
increasing stress themselves, facing a low-intensity conflict waged by 
like-minded Phil Gordons all across the country.</p>

<p>In Washington 
and West Virginia, both the ATF and the FBI powered up their comuter 
terminals one morning to find that they had been hacked in a coordinated
attack with large numbers of programs and millions of files corrupted 
by "The Sipsey Street Cyber Commandos." The NCIC was found to have been
interlaced with the entire phone directories of New York and 
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Senator Charles Schumer was later discovered 
to have had his name grafted onto the file of a convicted child 
molester, which flagged him for arrest when the computer discovered one 
of his addresses was too close to an elementary school. It was later 
determined to be an inside job by a contract employee with a spotless 
seventeen year record.</p>

<p>A week later, the IRS computer system 
crashed from a similar, but far more deadly cyber attack, also an inside
job. The total system failure, including redundancies, had been 
reckoned impossible prior to this. "Inconceivable," said one industry 
analyst familiar with the system. It wasn't.</p>

<p>ATF offices were 
being vandalized. In one night, a maintenance company employee 
crazy-glued every single lock in the federal building in Albany, New 
York.</p>

<p>Every.</p>

<p>Single.</p>

<p>Lock.</p>

<p>They were still 
trying to calculate how many gallons of crazy-glue that was. The 
perpretrator, who turned himself in the next morning to the Albany PD, 
declared himself a "prisoner of conscience" and was awaiting a jury 
trial.</p>

<p>In northern California, an HVAC contractor who had a cousin 
who was an exterminator, placed about a hundred dead and rotting rats in
the ductwork of a building that including an ATF field office over a 
weekend while the unit was being serviced. When the unit was turned 
back on the following Monday, thirteen office employees, three field 
agents and the ATF supervisory agent vomited.</p>

<p>This inspired other
attacks using Butyric acid -- which was much more easily deployable 
than dead rats -- all across the country. Butyric acid, a mild acid 
that smells like a combination of rancid butter and three day old vomit 
boiling on a stove, was inserted in random attacks on federal cars in 
the Phoenix Arizona area. This was accomplished by means of a large 
syringe with a needle inserted through the rubber seals of the door 
windows and then sprayed within. No car with federal plates was safe.</p>

<p>And no one wanted to drive them thereafter. Not even after they had been cleaned. Twice.</p>

<p>In
both Massachusetts and New Jersey, places that had competed for the 
title "Most Anti-Firearm State in the Country," arsons of federal 
government property were epidemic. In Trenton, every single federal 
vehicle in a storage lot was burned after the surveillance cameras had 
been paintballed into ineffectiveness.</p>

<p>Some of the incidents did 
not involve property and were not so petty. In Boston, an ATF 
supervisory agent was assassinated as he walked on a crowded midday 
street near Faneuil Hall. Shot in the back of the head with a .22 
pistol, his assassin had not yet been caught, or even identified.</p>

<p>More
restrictive laws were coming. More power was being claimed by the 
federal government. But more states were resisting, too, in the south, 
the west and rural midwest. Ironically, the number of violent incidents 
in those states was lower than in the "blue areas" where gun control was
wildly popular. The armed citizenry had not yet given up hope and faith
in their elected officials who, one way or another, were seeking to 
stand between the ATF, its mercenary auxiliaries and the people they 
were elected to protect. The citizen militias, it must be admitted, were
taking the intervening "Phony War" period seriously to train and 
further prepare for what seemed to be coming.</p>

<p>All of this was 
unknown to Charlie Quintard. He also was unaware that he had become a 
folk hero -- that country ballads were being sung about him. Nobody 
knew for sure what had happened, so everyone was free to read their own 
morality tale into the rumors. Charlie Daniel's version of his tale, a 
long re-work of "Simple Man," had made number one on the country charts a
week ago.</p>

<p>But even in his isolation, frustration and ignorance 
of things, Charlie Quintard in the end decided to stay alive, to force 
himself to be fit and alert, and to await the moment he could break 
cover and leave his prison cave forever. Then, he knew, he would wreak 
more vengeance upon the heads of the dogkillers of the ATF. And this 
time he would use a silenced submachine gun in addition to his bow, hawk
and knife. Phil Gordon and Pushmataha were not yet fully avenged.</p>

<p>Not by a long shot.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Peewee
Carpenter was pissed. He was pissed in way that almost unhinged him, as
men often are when money, power or sex are on the line. Peewee had 
taken successive tidal waves of destructive hits from the ATF's search 
for Charlie Quintard. You see, it was Peewee's marijuana fields, meth 
labs and crack houses which had been taken down one by one in the past 
month, toppling like dominos. He was even discomfited by the discovery 
of three of the four dead bodies, since they had been put in that 
condition on his orders.</p>

<p>He coped the best he could, transferring
operations to other counties. But there he ran into rivals, some of 
them old acquaintances, more vicious than Peewee and nursing murderous 
grudges. And, Peewee reflected angrily, it didn't help anyway because 
that damn blimp seemed to follow him wherever he went. Had he known that
it did so because of a carefully crafted ABI surveillance and 
disinformation plan put together by Will Shipman and Jack Durer, he 
would have lost his temper and had them both killed most gruesomely. He 
certainly was in a position to accomplish it.</p>

<p>But he didn't know.</p>

<p>So Shipman and Durer continued breathing, staying alive to continue to push Peewee Carpenter into a corner of their making.</p>

<p>Peewee
had his own sources on the Winston County Sheriff's Department and in 
the Drug Enforcement Administration come to that (although he had 
learned to his regret never to trust a DEA agent -- once bought they 
didn't stay bought) so he knew most of what they knew. And what they 
knew, or strongly suspected, was that Will Shipman was helping Charlie 
Quintard, though by what means they could not exactly say.</p>

<p>Peewee
Carpenter also learned that someone had even put out the rumor that the
ATF agents were dead at HIS orders because they stumbled on one of his 
drug operations. At various times the ATF leadership in Nashville almost
believed that one, especially after one of their agents and two 
Brightfire mercs had died tripping boobytraps and landmines laid around 
his one of his pot fields.</p>

<p>Peewee had the rest of his defenses 
removed after that. One of his competitors from Walker County had even 
come in and harvested one of his fields in the confusion. He felt he was
being pecked to death by crows. The only way he could start to recoup 
his staggering financial losses was to grab Charlie Quintard and claim 
the million dollar reward.</p>

<p>Even that, Peewee knew, wouldn't begin
to touch the damages he had been done. He'd worked the calculator two 
nights ago and he had figured that, in lost product, disrupted business 
and seized property and cash, that damned blimp had cost him upwards of 
15 million dollars.</p>

<p>Had Peewee been a man of stouter courage or 
greater daring, he would have kidnapped Shipman and tortured him until 
he talked. But this was Winston County and Shipman had many, many more 
friends than he did. The feud he would start with such a move would 
certainly be bad for business (and it could get worse, he knew, far 
worse) and it might even kill him.</p>

<p>Shipman was related to Aunt 
Jenny Brooks and everybody knew about her famous forty year feud. Just 
about everybody, no, strike that, make it EVERYBODY that the old woman 
had wanted dead had preceded her by a considerable margin. He knew that
because two of his own ancestors had been on Aunt Jenny's coup stick. 
And one of them had involuntarily provided that old bitch with her "soap
dish." In Winston County, Peewee knew, nobody ever got too far from 
their own history.</p>

<p>Peewee Carpenter did not get where he was by 
being foolhardy, so just as he had recoiled from fighting the feds at 
the edge of his pot fields, he would not start a feud. But what in Hell 
could he do about that blimp? He'd heard that it was controlled from a 
defended airfield across the state line in Tennessee. He'd even had the 
field reconned. It was way, way too tough a nut for his boys to crack. 
How could he knock down something that cruised from a mile to three 
miles up? It was an insoluble problem that didn't look like it was going
to get better, and it damn near made Peewee Carpenter insane.</p>

<p>It
was good that he was so distracted, for when the solution was presented
to him indirectly, cleverly, quietly, seemingly accidentally through an
intermediary, he did not question its origin so glad he was of its very
promise of relief. One of his boys, a meth head named Jerry Winfield 
had overheard a kid named Jimmy Flynn boasting that he knew how to take 
down the blimp, he even had the means to do so, but he didn't have the 
guts or the explosives to try it. But he could, he was sure. If, that 
is, he wasn't about to be married.</p>

<p>Winfield butted in on the conversation and asked him how he would do it.</p>

<p>Jimmy
pulled out a napkin from the restaurant table dispenser and diagrammed 
it out. It involved a weather balloon, several weather balloons 
actually, a video camera for tracking mounted on top, a lower structure 
strapped tight to the balloon consisting of stabilizers and rudders 
which were battery driven like a remote controlled aircraft and ten 
pounds of dynamite or C-4 packed inside ten pounds of military surplus 
flechettes or better yet, sharpened nails with the heads ground off. 
The lift was provided by hydrogen or helium gas in the balloon envelope.
Sure the blimp flew high, but weather balloons were designed to fly 
even higher.</p>

<p>The idea was to launch several of these devices at 
once, each with its own operators just like the blimp. Using the camera,
the pilot operator would guide the weather balloon bomb to the blimp, 
try to get beside or above it and an assistant would detonate the charge
with a cell phone when the operator ordered. The flechettes or nails 
would do the rest.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Jerry Winfield, "but where would you get the weather balloons? They don't grow on trees."</p>

<p>That
was the thing, said Jimmy Flynn, that made it so sweet. He'd been down 
to Birmingham last Saturday and spotted a whole boatload of World War II
vintage balloons in an Army surplus store. That's what had given him 
the idea.</p>

<p>What Jimmy Flynn neglected to mention was that the shop
carried them only because they had been given to the owner by somebody 
who was "cleaning out the basement of stuff grandpa collected." The 
owner, always willing to accept a gift, marketed them as novel war 
relics, priced them at $20.00 each and, up until Jerry Winfield 
overheard Jimmy Flynn, he had sold exactly none of them. He didn't even 
get the name of the lady who gave them to him. They had in fact come 
from Deacon Shipman's legacy.</p>

<p>The key, Jimmy said, was to launch 
several at them at once from a carefully constructed grid of launching 
sites beneath the blimp's course. Anybody who did this would likely only
have one shot at it. But of course it wouldn't be Jimmy Flynn who did 
it, but he was certain it could be done.</p>

<p>The thing about the idea
in Peewee Carpenter's mind was that as zany and idiotic as it sounded, 
as he looked at the napkin diagram and thought about it, it just might 
work. And what would be the downside? He would be destroying private 
property, but not even government property. And it wasn't like he was 
killing anybody. What was the punishment for that? Something like 
vandalism, right? Oh, maybe there'd be an explosive charge or so, but 
nobody living would testify against HIM in federal court. He'd beat 
those kind of odds before, after the key witnesses disappeared or caught
infectious amnesia.</p>

<p>So he put out the word. If anybody knew of a
customer who worked in a model shop or played around with remote 
control aircraft, he, Peewee Carpenter, wanted to know about it. The 
next day he dispatched Jerry Winfield to Birmingham to buy 20 weather 
balloons, and by the afternoon he'd heard back through his distributor 
network that a there was a pothead in Huntsville who worked with RC 
aircraft behind the counter of a hobby shop.</p>

<p>A promise of a pound
of weed up front got the man up to Winston County the next day. Once 
the job was explained to him, he was certain it could be accomplished. 
His enthusiasm may have been strengthened by the promise of an 
additional ten free pounds of Peewee's best when the job was completed.</p>

<p>He
did it in two long days in a machine shop whose owner owed Peewee a 
gambling debt. The worst problem the modeler had was supervising the 
many minions Peewee had ordered to help him.</p>

<p>Using aircraft 
aluminum, plastic strapping, and light alloy brackets, the RC man 
produced one prototype and then ten production models. The only 
difference between them being that the explosives and projectiles 
(Peewee decided on nails as they were cheaper than flechettes) were 
replaced by twenty pounds of bricks in the prototype.</p>

<p>The helium 
was expensive. So were the cameras, the electronics, the ground station 
TV screens and the used pickup trucks towing ten stolen cotton trailers.
 They improvised plywood sides, fronts and backs that blocked the view 
of the trailer interior from the ground but which had open tops so the 
balloons could be fully inflated and launched without impediment. The 
ballons were to be partly inflated under tarps in the trailers, and only
fully inflated just before launch. The steering rig and explosives pod
below and the TV camera on top were held in place by light bungee rope.
 With care, as the balloon expanded, so did the arrangement of the 
control package and payload. The modeler was particularly proud of 
that. Peewee was unimpressed.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but will it work?"</p>

<p>The
prototype was tested the third day when, in a remote part of Walker 
county well away from prying airborne eyes, the RC modeler almost hit a 
Cessna flying at 5,000 feet. The Cessna belonged to Peewee's 
organization, having been used to smuggle a variety of banned substances
over the years. The fact that Peewee had to put one of his men in the 
side seat with a gun held to the reluctant pilot's head was of no 
concern to him.</p>

<p>In the expert hands of the RC modeler, it was a 
near miss. Peewee Carpenter was ecstatic. After all, the plane had been 
flying in a slow circle. The blimp would be almost still. What he didn't
know was that the pilot decided before he landed that he would take 
that DEA agent's offer of witness protection the next time he saw him. 
Looking at Peewee, the pilot thought, this mother is NUTS.</p>

<p>The 
fourth day was spent dealing with an oversight. They needed somebody 
with access to the air traffic control system to tell them in real time 
where the blimp was and what altitude and heading it was on before they 
set their grid to attack it. By happy circumstance, they found their 
man. What Peewee didn't know was that one of his hardy band of two 
dozen minions entrusted with knowledge of his project was a young state 
trooper -- pulled out of his academy class for precocious aptitude by 
ABI a year before -- who had been building a state drug case against him
for six months. ABI didn't trust DEA either.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, Peewee Carpenter sprung what he thought was HIS trap.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
Brightfire pilot tech was by now thoroughly familiar with the ground 
below the blimp's path. They had been stooging around over the Sipsey 
Wilderness for the past two days, following snitch leads that Quintard 
might have withdrawn north from his old familiar stomping grounds in the
lower Bankhead. This was not unusual. They had followed such ultimately
bogus leads for a week now without result. But this morning they had 
been ordered to look at a particular farmstead and surrounding woods 
outside Double Springs. Here the vegetation was not so thick. Here, they
might have a good shot at pinning this Quintard prick to the ground. 
The tech hoped it wasn't another false alarm. He had heard that a 
special team had been brought in to run him down. He hoped they were as 
good as rumored. He was tired of this chickenshit terrain and this 
boring job. He wanted to get back to armed Predators where he could kill
something.</p>

<p>Give me the desert and a Hellfire missile any day. 
And, he thought, somewhere where the local women don't think you're some
kind of murdering Nazi for being a Brightfire employee. These cold, 
stuck-up Tennessee bitches gave him piles, and little else.</p>

<p>The 
thing was, closer into Double Springs the road net became ideal for 
setting up the box grid that Jimmy Flynn had first outlined on the 
napkin. Not that the tech apprehended any trouble. He saw a pickup and a
trailer covered with a tarp headed into the farmstead as his "back 
seater" sensor man focused his array toward it. It always amazed him how
clear the pictures were he got from the suite of systems mounted on the
blimp. Night or day, it was nothing less than magical.</p>

<p>The truck
halted. Men jumped out and pulled the tarp from the top of the trailer.
What the hell is that? First he thought it, then he said it aloud.</p>

<p>"Dunno," said the back seater, who actually sat beside him in a chair (Air Force jargon died hard). "It's round."<br>"What-the-hell?" they both blurted at once. Their supervisor came over to have a closer look.</p>

<p>"What's the angle on the camera shot?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Five degrees," came the answer.</p>

<p>"Full speed, emergency. Hard to starboard," came the order.</p>

<p>You
don't do a wing over in a blimp, trading altitude for sideward motion. 
But you do have some ability to maneuver. It was the blimp's only hope.</p>

<p>"Widen the view."</p>

<p>Damn,
there were two, three, five, six of these things coming up at the RPV. 
No, there were MORE. And they were coming up FAST. They weren't trying 
to outrun just one attacker. They had to escape a box of attackers.</p>

<p>"Hell, they're balloons!" the rear seater exclaimed. "What the..."</p>

<p>"Christ, you don't think..."</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence. The operator goosed the blimp frantically. Some, not all, of the balloons followed.</p>

<p>The
supervisor shook his head in horrified amazement. "What kind of stupid
bastard attacks Brightfire?" he marveled. And then he thought, whoever
he is, they'll have his balls mounted on a plaque in the corporate 
boardroom in Virginia this time next week. Brightfire's long reach and 
vindictive nature was legendary.</p>

<p>Then, one by one and two by two, they began to explode.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Down
on the ground, Peewee Carpenter was beside himself with joy as he 
guided his balloon toward the blimp. The problem was that he kept 
over-correcting. This was a problem for eight out of the ten operators 
because they had no practice and no video game skills to speak of. Most 
of them were junkies themselves, which didn't bode well for their 
reflexes or their calculating abilities.</p>

<p>Peewee Carpenter lost 
sight of the target on the monitor as his balloon not only spun but 
yawed wildly while he gave violent corrections to his equally violent 
mistakes. Shit, he thought. This isn't going to work.</p>

<p>In point of
fact it didn't work for eight out of the ten balloons. Had a 
disinterested observer been able to take in all of the frantic cursing 
and hopping about the various stolen cotton trailers he would have 
beheld a scene that looked like a cross between Homer Hickham's Rocket 
Boys and Jimmy Breslin's The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight -- played
by a cast of high school dropout stoners -- and laughed himself to 
death. For the few hundred Winston Countians more or less below the 
barrage and in a position to see, the rise of the balloon craft was 
stunning and their subsequent explosions incredible. Everyone above the 
age of five who witnessed it realized it was an attack on the Brightfire
surveillance blimp. Including, most especially, the ATF agents and 
Brightfire contractors who depended upon it on the ground.</p>

<p>The 
only two balloon bomb operators who got their Rube Goldberg craft close 
enough to do some damage were the RC modeler and an 18 year old kid 
who'd played video games all his life. Still, the kid's charge blew up 
short of the blimp because he misjudged his distance to target. Net 
result: a few holes in the envelope cells, but nothing fatal.</p>

<p>The
RC man on the other hand earned his ten pounds of weed. His balloon's 
nails tore through the control hydraulics, half the sensor array and 
punched gaping holes in the gas bag. It was redundant by design, but not
that redundant.</p>

<p>Half blind, out of control, the precious helium 
lift whistling out through multiple tears, the blimp began its 2 mile 
fall toward Smith Lake, slowly at first, then picking up speed. When the
gondola hit the rocks of a nearby ridge instead, the rest of the $6 
million dollar Brightfire surveillance system was smashed to useless 
metal, plastic and ceramic shards. Peewee Carpenter's rage against the 
machine that had complicated his life was successful, even if it hadn't 
been his own idea. And, like most things in life, there were unintended 
consequences. But those would come later.</p>

<p>And the funny thing was, though he was long dead, <i>Feldwebel</i>
Helmut Grass had finally achieved his most fervent wish. His actions 
back in February 1945 had in some small measure helped shoot down an 
American aircraft, thus wreaking vengence for those terrifying Ami Jabos
which had made him piss his pants in that squalid Normandy ditch so 
very long ago. No one knew that however, not even Will Shipman. <i>Feldwebel</i>
Grass, of course, had long since ceased to care.</p>

<hr/>

<p>With the downing of the blimp, the race began.</p>

<p>Will
Shipman would have been forced to move Charlie Quintard soon anyway. 
The disinformation game was pretty much played out and as Will marked 
off the areas of the Bankhead and Sipsey that had been searched by the 
ATF and Brightfire, one area on the map was unmarked and must soon be 
covered by the feds -- the ridge that held Charlie's cave. But now, with
all of the fed's attention riveted upon the downing of the blimp and 
the people who had destroyed it, they had a chance. Charlie had to 
exfiltrate out NOW. Arrangements had been made, his destination was 
fixed. Will keyed the mic on the radio three times, then two, then 
three.</p>

<p>Charlie heard it, keyed the proper response -- three 
clicks -- turned down the volume, lit the fuse on the dynamite jammed 
under the overhanging shelf at the entrance to his cave, and began to 
run.</p>

<p>He carried his bow and quiver, his tomahawk and knife and 
the MAC-10 on a SpecOps shoulder sling that had previously belonged to 
Special Agent Duncan. He had the magazine pouch slung over his shoulder.
All the magazines were pristine now, inside and out, not a trace of 
rust remaining and all were loaded with USGI .45 Caliber ball 
ammunition. To the shoulder strap of the mag pouch he had duct-taped the
M15 smoke grenade, which he had removed from its container. The radio 
was jammed in his pants pocket, and his space-blanket-lined poncho was 
carefully folded and and tucked in his belt at the small of his back.</p>

<p>Behind
him, the blast dropped the overhang into the cave mouth, blocking it 
from casual inspection. His stash would be safe until after the federal 
heat went away. Not that Charlie cared about his trophies.</p>

<p>He was on a run for his life.</p>

<p>He
loped away from the cave, elated at regaining his long-lost freedom yet
running as he had always walked, carefully --always staying under 
overhead cover except when he had to cross roads and trails, using the 
terrain as his ally, moving at angles, using streams when appropriate 
and never ever in a straight line, but always on course, headed for the 
pre-arranged pickup point.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
Brightfire tracker team leader was sitting in the front passenger seat 
of his Humvee at the junction of two logging roads in the Bankhead, 
paying attention to the radio chatter generated by the blimp's 
destruction and awaiting orders when he heard the explosion echoing in 
the hills from Charlie's cave. "Damn," he muttered to no one in 
particular, "That was close." The echoing made direction determination 
difficult, but he guessed that it was roughly northwest of where he was 
now.</p>

<p>He looked at the map board which he had been consulting 
before the explosion. The vehicle GPS was out. That was OK, he was used 
to navigating the old fashioned way in any case. He despised people who 
were helpless without their electronic toys. He tugged on the lanyard of
his lensatic compass and it popped out of the pocket on his harness and
into his hand. This was the first time they'd worked this area, but he 
was unafraid, confident in his team and his own competence. After a 
moment's orientation, he decided. "Saddle up," he ordered his other 
three team members. They headed up the lesser of the two logging roads, 
making straight for Charlie's ridge.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
rest of the hundreds of Brightfire and ATF personnel in and around 
Winston County were instantly focused on finding out where those 
balloons came from. The radio message from the Brightfire blimp 
operations center in Tennessee gave them descriptions of the pickup 
trucks with cotton trailers, so that's what they were looking for. What 
they didn't know now that the blimp was in pieces was that Peewee's 
orders were to dump the trailers in place and disperse in the pickup 
trucks.</p>

<p>One thing slowed them down. Peewee had ordered his 
minions to take the empty helium cylinders from the trailers and throw 
them in the back of the pickups. There was a deposit on the cylinders.</p>

<p>Sheriff
Carter Johnson, on the other hand, knew almost exactly where all of the
balloon bombers were as well as complete descriptions of them and the 
license plate numbers of their trucks. He knew this because Jack Durer's
ABI men had provided them via an anonymous cell phone call to the 
Sheriff's department ten minutes before the attack. And the informant 
provided one other thing. The name of the ringleader of the conspiracy 
and his motive.</p>

<p>Carter Johnson was salivating at the chance to 
nail Peewee Carpenter, and he wanted to get him before the ATF did. 
Hell, thought Carter, this'll get both the ATF and the friends of 
Charlie Quintard off my back. Skeeter Haynes wouldn't stand a chance in 
the primary now. By the time the bombs were launched, every Winston 
County deputy Sheriff Johnson could muster was racing down the various 
roads toward Peewee and his doper confederates.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"STOP!"
ordered the Brightfire tracker team leader, whose name was Finley. 
Ahmed, his assistant team leader who was driving, stopped on a dime. His
team deployed, guns up.</p>

<p>Finley had picked Ahmed up in Iraq after
the Sunni had taken his chance to continue a long-standing blood feud 
by murdering the grandson of the tribal sheik. Ahmed was a former 
Baathist party enforcer who was wanted under another name by the Iraqi 
government for war crimes in the aftermath of the 1991 war, and was then
acting as Finley's translator. Since Finley deemed Ahmed too valuable 
to give up, he'd had himself and his team transferred out of that 
province. The fact that the shiek's vengeance ultimately took the lives 
of twenty-six American soldiers and Marines before the shiek himself 
(along with most of his extended family) was killed by a Hellfire missle
was of little concern to Finley</p>

<p>When Finley left Iraq, Ahmed 
came along, sporting a green card provided by Brightfire along with his 
company ID. Brightfire hired a lot of foreign personnel and frankly 
wasn't too picky about their pasts.</p>

<p>Armando, his radio operator, 
was a Nicaraguan, but whether he'd fought with the Sandanistas or the 
Contras was a little unclear. Maybe both, for it was certain that both 
sides wanted him dead. He'd also found a home at Brightfire.</p>

<p>Patrick
Docker was another survivor of a dirty little war. The Orangeman had 
killed one too many innocent Irishmen of both faiths in and around 
Belfast and while the Brits didn't want him, the IRA (though ostensibly 
now at peace) still did. Badly.</p>

<p>My own little private Foreign 
Legion, smiled Finley. All veterans of dirty wars, all killers, and all 
skilled as any of Cochise's Apaches at tracking. They'd worked for 
Brightfire in eleven different countries now and always got their man or
provided a corpse that looked a lot like him. The company got paid big 
bucks for their work, and Brightfire took care of them too. They were 
among the company's highest paid operators.</p>

<p>The light wind blew 
over the ridge and down toward the Humvee. None of Finley's men were 
smokers. He insisted on it. Armando laid an index finger up to his nose.
Finley smelled it too. Work around enough explosives and you get to 
know their individual bouquets. Dynamite. Finley nodded at Armando. 
Dynamite and rock dust. With a pointed silent order from Finley, they 
secured the doors of the Humvee and moved up the ridge in formation, 
Ahmed leading. Finley came second with Armando behind and to his right. 
Docker came up the rear.</p>

<p>When they came to the collapsed mouth of
the cave, fresh rubble completely blocking it, it was Docker not Finley
who figured it out first. "The bloody fooker has scarpered. He's usin' 
the confusion to exfil." Ahmed spotted some of Charlie's sign, lost the 
trail, then picked it up again more toward the top of the ridge. Most 
anybody else would have missed it, Finley knew.</p>

<p>He's gone over 
the other side, Finley knew, not bothering to take the map out of his 
pocket because he had memorized it. He was gifted that way.</p>

<p>He'll
be getting a ride, probably at that dirt road on the other side of the 
next ridge. His reaction was instant. "Dock, you and Ahmed trail him. 
Don't lose him, but don't engage. We'll go down to the Hummer and try to
cut him off at the next road past the second ridge. Then we'll bag him.
If we can, I want him alive. GO!"</p>

<p>As they ran back down, Armando
pressed the ear-bud screwed into his left ear and then half-yelled, 
"Jefe, they want us back down to chase the balloon bombers."</p>

<p>"Bullshit," replied Finley, "tell 'em..."</p>

<p>No,
he stopped himself, don't tell them I'm chasing a million dollars. 
Somebody else might get a bright idea and get to him first. "Tell them 
we think we've got a small group of 'em up here and we're in hot 
pursuit. We can't break off without letting them get away in heavy 
terrain. Tell 'em that." Armando smiled. He too saw the million dollars 
in front of his face. He smiled again, more broadly, and began to speak 
urgently, pleadingly, into the radio mic.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sheriff
Johnson would have nailed all ten teams of Peewee's balloon bombers 
within a half hour if it hadn't been for the ATF and Brightfire idiots 
getting in his way. The whole business looked like "The Keystone Kops 
Head Themselves Off at the Pass" and would have been hysterically funny,
except for the dead bodies it generated.</p>

<p>The Brightfire mercs in particular were ravenous for vengeance on the bombers of their $6 million blimp. They wanted blood.</p>

<p>Some
of the ATF agents whose orders the Brightfire people were supposed to 
be following simply lost control of the mercs. This was largely due to 
the fact that the Brightfires maintained their own comm channels with 
their bosses, and when they received conflicting orders they obeyed the 
men who handed them their paychecks.</p>

<p>And when you lose control of
angry people with machineguns, a goodly portion of whom are foreigners 
and can't communicate in English very well anyway, you'd better run and 
hide. That is exactly and precisely what most of the outnumbered ATF 
agents did. They got out of the way and control passed to mad, excited 
mercenaries unfamiliar with law enforcement but intimately, lovingly 
familiar with war and murder.</p>

<p>Some set up roadblocks and refused 
to let the deputies pass, not trusting local law enforcement. Although 
tempers flared and guns were drawn, no one was killed at most of these 
confrontations. Most, but not all.</p>

<p>Seventy-two year old Millicent
Sylvan was shot through the head at one of these roadblocks on US 278 
by a Brightfire merc from Costa Rica who misunderstood the orders of his
section leader who was Ukrainian. Sylvan's 16 year old granddaughter 
Merry Kay was left a paraplegic by the same burst and would never 
cheerlead again.</p>

<p>That was bad enough.</p>

<p>It got worse.</p>

<p>Sheriff
Carter Johnson and three deputies hit another roadblock on a 
blacktopped sideroad about a mile off 278 right behind the pickup 
carrying Peewee Carpenter and Jerry Winfield. There were four 
Brightfires on the block, which consisted of their Humvee and a county 
road grader that they had pulled across the road, completely 
interdicting it. They'd been set up just about thirty seconds or so when
Peewee's truck came around the corner with Jerry Winfield at the wheel 
and slammed on the brakes. They came to rest 60 feet in front of the 
grader. The two Winston County Sheriff's cars following likewise slammed
on their brakes and executed a vee-shaped block about 50 feet behind 
the pickup. The Sheriff and deputies took cover behind their vehicles, 
two shotguns and two pistols up and ready. Peewee had nowhere to go.</p>

<p>Standing
on the porch of a bait store on the east side of the road, just 
slightly behind and to the right of the Brightfire roadblock, was an 
undercover ABI man named Finch and a reporter and his cameraman from 
WBRC-6 News in Birmingham. Finch had been detailed to tail this bunch of
mercenaries, The news crew was there because they had been alerted an 
hour before according to Jack Durer's clandestine media plan that 
"something was going on in Winston County."</p>

<p>The crew had missed 
seeing and filming the balloon assault on the blimp, but they were now 
aware of it thanks to Finch, who they thought was a local. The crew had 
stopped here ten minutes ago to get sodas and ask directions. They broke
out their gear when the mercenaries hotwired the roadgrader and moved 
it into place. The screech of Peewee's truck tires brought the camera 
back up and running.</p>

<p>Finch, having a better idea of what was 
about to happen or perhaps just out of an abundance of experienced 
caution, took cover behind the ice machine and drew his pistol from 
under his shirt.</p>

<p>In a normal law enforcement operation, this was 
perfect. The four mercs on the roadblock were loaded for bear and one of
them even had an M-240 medium machine gun on a bipod laying across the 
hood of the Hummer. Chambered in 7.62 NATO, it was loaded with standard 
military fare, a hundred round belt of one tracer for every four ball 
rounds.</p>

<p>The criminals were caught in a bag of overwhelming fire 
power and only a madman would have tried to shoot it out rather than 
meekly surrender. And despite the frightened pilot's low opinion of him,
when it came to HIS skin, Peewee was decidely NOT crazy. He folded like
a cheap suit, got out of the pickup slowly with his hands in air and 
told Jerry to do the same.</p>

<p>But this wasn't "a normal law enforcement operation." Still, for a long moment it looked that way.</p>

<p>Sheriff
Johnson called out to the two men to turn around, face him and get down
on the ground. Peewee was relieved to see it was Carter Johnson himself
and he knew now he was going to live. He immediately complied and so 
did Jerry Winfield. Carter came around the trunk of his patrol car with 
his pistol up, motioning downward as walked forward to emphasize his 
command. Dick Williams, a deputy with nine years on the force and a wife
and three kids, did likewise from the other car.</p>

<p>Here's the 
thing that no one could figure out later. All four of these Brightfires 
were Americans born and bred. No foreigners, they had grown up with the 
idea that when a criminal is called upon to surrender and he complies, 
he is cuffed and taken off to jail after having his rights read to him. 
There were no language difficulties here. Everyone within earshot 
understood what had happened, what was happening, and where this would 
go from here.</p>

<p>Only it didn't.</p>

<p>Maybe somebody thought that 
Peewee was Charlie Quintard, the murderous ghostly Indian who had 
"disappeared" armed men by means of black magic, even though Peewee 
looked nothing like him. Maybe somebody thought that their chance at a 
million dollars was going to walk away and into a Sheriff's car. Maybe 
the gunner didn't intend to kill anybody other then Peewee. The M-240 
is a hoss of a weapon and maybe the recoil got the better of him.</p>

<p>You
could count the maybes forever and still not understand why that M-240 
started up, catching Peewee in the back and head as he was dropping 
down, blowing his brains out on the blacktop and then, muzzle rising, 
stitching the Sheriff diagonally from right kidney to spine to heart. 
Carter Johnson, ex-Marine, survivor of many a battle in South Vietnam 
and thirty plus years of law enforcement, died without a sigh on a 
public road in his own home county. The only thing that crossed his mind
as he fell was that Skeeter Haynes was going to win that primary after 
all.</p>

<p>When the M-240 quit, there was dead silence. Then the rest 
of the mercs, knowing about the camera crew, seeing the dead Sheriff and
the looks on the deputies' faces turning from shock to wrath, decided 
that there had better be just one narrative told of this and that it had
best be theirs. In the silence, they made their decision, and the guns 
behind the HumVee and the grader started up once more.</p>

<p>Dick 
Williams, rooted in place out in the open, died next, hit by 5.56mm fire
from an M-4. Then Jerry Winfield, screaming and cursing.</p>

<p>Then it
was Horace Pines' turn. Horace was a reserve deputy who wasn't even 
getting paid to do this crap. He was a volunteer and he paid the price. 
Frightened to death and huddled down behind the rear of the Sheriff's 
own car, the M-240 rounds sieved it and him, tracers detonating the gas 
tank and setting him afire. When the second sweep of the belt finally 
killed him, he didn't mind.</p>

<p>One of the mercs remembered the 
camera crew and carefully shot the reporter through the head, only to 
killed by a shot from the pistol of a very lucky ABI Agent Finch that 
blew through the Brightfire's clenched teeth and lodged in the medulla 
oblongata. The mercenary went down like a sack.</p>

<p>The M-240 shifted
toward Finch and the ice machine and as it did, Arthur Curtis Looney, 
descendant of a famous Winston County Unionist and the last deputy 
alive, leaned across the hood of the remaining patrol car and hit the 
gunner with a 12 gauge shotgun slug that went in through the flabby 
flesh of his left arm, just over the side panel of his Interceptor body 
armor and traversed the chest cavity.</p>

<p>The gunner, whose finger 
was already on the trigger, reflexively began firing as he spun and 
fell, killing the man beside him who was shooting at the cameraman and 
Finch and missing them both. The dying gunner's burst also flushed from 
cover the last merc, who had to come from behind the big road grader 
tire to get away from deadly stream. In doing so, he was hit by three of
Finch's pistol rounds and two of Looney's 12 gauge slugs.</p>

<p>His body armor stopped some.</p>

<p>Not all.</p>

<p>He
didn't die immediately, but after he was disarmed of his M-4 carbine 
and M-9 pistol by Finch, nobody bothered trying to give him first aid 
either.</p>

<p>Throughout it all, the camera never blinked, though the 
subsequent footage had a blurry spot in the lower right that wouldn't go
away. It was a tiny piece of the reporter's scalp with one long, 
carefully combed hair sticking out of it. Bullets do funny things.</p>

<p>How
the cameraman hadn't died, he couldn't figure out. There were 5.56mm 
holes in the post he had been steadying the camera against. One of them,
right where his head had been, had hit a knot and turned just enough to
miss him, expending the rest of its green-tipped energy in the wall of 
the bait store behind him.</p>

<p>Looking down at the ruined face of the
pretty-boy reporter who he'd never really liked, he knew that from this
day he could either become a drunkard or a convinced Christian for the 
rest of his life. One or the other. He'd never been a church-going guy 
and at that particular moment he badly wanted a shot of Jack Daniels.</p>

<p>In
the end, he went home with his prize winning footage, told his story 
over and over again a hundred times in the next few days, hugged his 
wife and two little kids repeatedly... and went to church that Sunday
and every Sunday after.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Charlie
Quintard didn't know how he knew, but he knew he was being tracked. It 
wouldn't matter if the extraction vehicle was there, and he was already 
over the second ridge and almost to the road.</p>

<p>On the road, about a
hundred and twenty yards down from where Charlie was going to come out,
was Jimmy Flynn in obedience to Will Shipman's orders to be at Point A 
for the link-up. Flynn sat in his official military surplus Winston 
County Volunteer Search and Rescue ambulance, dressed in his official 
SAR uniform, with his heart in his throat, making a poor job of 
whistling "Finnegan's Wake" as he tried to steady his nerves. It wasn't 
working. The song reminded him that his family were relative newcomers 
to Winston County, but were no strangers to gunfire.</p>

<p>Jimmy was 
mostly descended from a short line of Irish coal miners, the first of 
whom had gotten mixed up in some IRA business in the Forties when the 
entire western world was supposed to be fighting Nazi tyranny -- only 
nobody had told the Irish republican holdouts. They still cursed the 
long-dead Michael Collins and "that bloody treaty." Some in the IRA 
thought they had an identity of interest with the Germans as an enemy of
the British and one of them was Patrick Flynn, who hadn't even been 
born in 1916, and was only a newborn in 1921.</p>

<p>The IRA taught 
Patrick Flynn to be a bombmaker -- his teacher was an old Fenian with 
just six fingers left on both hands -- and sent him to London on an 
abortive sabotage bombing campaign that failed before it started because
the Brits owned the Nazi spy ring he was supposed to work with. Almost 
killed in the roundup, Patrick escaped with Webley revolver bullet holes
in his clothes and talked his way onto Liberty ship that needed a 
stoker. The forged US passport which indicated he had been born in 
America helped, as did the religious preference expressed on it -- "P" 
for Protestant. Orangemen were thought to be much more trustworthy than 
Catholics and sabotage was still a lively concern.</p>

<p>Patrick often 
joked later about his "conversion," but his documents were good enough 
to get him a job once he jumped ship in New York and headed to the coal 
fields of Alabama -- which had the double advantage of being starved for
competent help as well as being just about as far from the U.S. 
immigration authorities in New York as you could get without crossing 
the Mississippi River. And Patrick Flynn was a very competent blaster. 
If he hadn't had a chance to use his skills on the Brits, it wasn't his 
fault. But there was a war on and coal was a vital part of that war. 
Nobody looked too close at his story, and besides, Patrick Flynn had 
always been a convincing liar with more than a touch of the blarney.</p>

<p>By
the time Patrick died early of black lung in the 1960s, nobody thought 
of him as anything other than American, including close family friends. 
The menfolk of his family knew the secret though, and it was passed from
father to son. And there were always plenty of Flynn sons. Jimmy was 
the third of four in his family, and he had cousins who came from 
families of six, seven, even nine siblings. Work hard, have sons, die 
young -- that had been the Flynn inheritance. Only Jimmy had escaped the
mines and had no intention of ever going. Factory work was safer and 
cleaner. Besides, the mine jobs were drying up and blowing away anyway. 
And Jimmy was determined to be a solid, dependable breadwinner for his 
soon-to-be new wife.</p>

<p>Flynn prayed he would get to see Katy Dobson
after THIS day. He prayed and he whistled some of the "old tunes" as 
his father had called them. Jimmy's favorite had always been Finnegan's 
Wake. Still, he was doing a real poor job of it when two things happened
almost simultaneously -- Charlie Quintard broke from cover onto the 
road more than a football field away and Finley's Humvee rounded the 
curve less than half that distance past Charlie.</p>

<p>Charlie took it 
all in in a glance and without breaking stride, bolted across the road 
and up the rising ground of yet another ridge and beyond that, a 
sure-'nuff mountain. Charlie knew the ground and realized he would have 
to deal with his pursuers before he caught a ride out of hell. So up he 
went, past Point A and off to what he hoped was freedom, leaving the 
tracker team leader with a dilemma.</p>

<hr/>

<p>At
this point, Finley screwed up. It was the bow and quiver that first 
threw him. Charlie had the bow slung across his back from high left to 
low right and so it was the first thing that Finley noticed about him. 
Bow and arrows? Bow and ARROWS? I knew he was Cherokee but bow and 
arrows? Since the MAC-10 was slung up tight in his right armpit, and the
Brightfire vehicle approached from Charlie's left, it was shielded from
Finley's sight.</p>

<p>The team leader didn't know how close Ahmed and 
Docker were to the road, but in any case they had to be right on 
Quintard's tail. Charlie was already lost to sight in the vegetation. 
On the other hand, there sat the Indian's salvation less than 200 yards 
away down a rutted but straight road. A million dollars just crossed the
road, but there sits his ride. We've just about got the Indian run to 
ground, but his help probably knows the ground as well as he does, and 
that's better than we do. Take him out of the equation and the Indian 
has to hoof it out and we'll track him and kill him.</p>

<p>That was the second thing that threw him.</p>

<p>He
tried to have it both ways and got neither. He ordered Armando to go 
for the ambulance, while he leaned out the window to take it under fire.
This was just plain stupid because nobody hits a target that far away 
down a rutted roadway from a bouncing vehicle without God's own miracle 
making it happen. God was not on Finley's side this day, nor it would 
later turn out, on any other day either.</p>

<p>In fact, by shooting at 
Jimmy Flynn, Finley shocked him out of his fear-frozen reverie. Jimmy 
threw the ambulance into reverse gear and backed crazily down the road 
as fast as he could go and as he rounded the curve backwards, Finley 
lost sight of him. Screw this, Finley realized his mistake. The million 
dollars is headed in another direction. And Docker and Ahmed had to be 
tired. We'll lose him.</p>

<p>He ordered Armando into reverse and they 
got back to where Charlie crossed the road just as the other two mercs 
debouched onto the road to greet them. They were winded, fighting the 
extra weight of their body armor. Finley and Armando were not. They took
up the lead, following Charlie up the ridge. Ahmed locked the vehicle, 
sucking in air, and then he and Docker followed up the ridge.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Jimmy
Flynn kept backing up the narrow road until he got to an old rail bed 
that had serviced a nearby abandoned mine. Without missing a beat, he 
slewed the rear end of the ambulance onto the road bed and threw it into
drive, retreating even faster down the narrow dirt track in forward as 
if the Hounds of Hell were still on his track.</p>

<p>They weren't. They were on Charlie's.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For
his part, Charlie Quintard wasn't quite winded, but he was close. As he
half-climbed, half-ran, Sherlock Holmes sprang into his consciousness. 
"Watson, the game's afoot!" Yeah, thought Charlie bitterly, and I'm the 
game. He made the crest of the third ridge and angled off down to the 
right, knowing where he was going but not yet knowing exactly what he 
was going to do when he got there. The backside of the ridge bottomed 
out into a flat area that many years ago had buildings sitting on it. 
The old railroad bed that Jimmy Flynn had turned around on came through 
the ridge by a short tunnel and cut through this flat space, leading to 
Charlie's destination. Miller Mine.</p>

<p>Charlie Quintard ran right up
to bars across the mine entrance, shucked his bow and quiver and leaned
them up against the rails. A look down told him it was as he had 
remembered -- the footprints left behind by somebody many years ago were
still there in the coal dust, indistinct in the sunlight nearer the 
opening from the effects of winds. There were four sets, all going into 
the mine. He had to climb up a bit, but Charlie slipped between the bars
and stepped down carefully into one of the larger marks. He then 
freshened the trail in the sunlight, moving in about twenty yards until 
he could barely see the originals. Then he carefully backed out in the 
same marks, heels held high.</p>

<p>As he raised his foot, to step up and out, he saw the black stuff stuck to his mocassins like glue. Damn. No time.</p>

<p>Before
taking a step on the rail, he slipped the left moccasin off and stepped
up on his bare foot. He stuck the moccasin in his open shirt, sliming 
himself but too scared and hurried to care. Then, holding onto the 
vertical rail with his left, he repeated the process with his right.</p>

<p>Up,
then, and outside, but he didn't drop to the ground. Reaching down, he
slung his bow and quiver again. Then Charlie Quintard climbed. He 
scrambled up using the horizontal stringers of the bars made from rails,
gripping the verticals with his hands, his bare feet on the iron. Up, 
up, past the capstone with it's "1918" and Charlie dropped over the 
carved stone into the eroded hollow behind it just as Finley and Armando
emerged from the trees across the open space.</p>

<p>Control, Charlie, 
he thought. CONTROL. You're not only going to breathe slowly through 
your mouth, you're not going to make the slightest noise. Fight the 
blackness. Fight the urge to suck it in. CONTROL. Breathe deeply now 
while you can, but don't gasp.</p>

<p>Slower as they approach. Slower. SLOWER.</p>

<p>They're here.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As
they approached the mouth of the mine, the mercenaries split up and did
so from each side, Armando and Finley on right, Ahmed and Docker on the
left, careful not to silhouette themselves for Charlie who they were 
all convinced had disappeared into the inky blackness beyond the 
sunlight. There was no other obvious place he could hide, was there? 
Finley scanned the mountainside and wondered, but not for long.</p>

<p>He
hated to go into this ambush alley. In any other situation in any other
war, he could have called on outside help to finish the job.</p>

<p>Could have and would have.</p>

<p>But not here and not now.</p>

<p>Part of it, a big part of it he knew, was the million dollars. Split four ways it was a lot.</p>

<p>Split one way was better.</p>

<p>But there was more to it than that.</p>

<p>He was cocky. He realized it, but he didn't care. The bow was part of it.</p>

<p>The fact that Finley hadn't spotted the MAC-10 was part of it too.</p>

<p>The
fact that this guy couldn't be as smart as everybody feared he was 
because he had made a beeline to a death trap was also a consideration.</p>

<p>One way in and one way out, right?</p>

<p>Death trap.</p>

<p>Finally,
they had the critical advantage -- they owned the darkness. They had 
PVS-14 night vision monoculars plus IR weapon sights and illuminators. 
They would spot him long before he would see them, if they stayed 
plastered up along the sides of the mine and moved slowly, quietly. He 
wouldn't even be able to see in the IR spectrum while they painted him 
plainly for death. The team had often killed in darkness or in the 
pitchblack inner corridors of urban buildings.</p>

<p>Their previous 
prey had all had guns -- they could shoot back -- and yet they were all 
deader than Julius Ceasar whereas Finley and his boys were still 
victorious, alive and kicking. All this guy had was a stone age bow and 
maybe a knife. Hell, this would be no different, unless you figured 
easier as different.</p>

<p>Yeah, maybe that's what the ten ATF agents 
thought. But then his pride and arrogance took over. Well, that was them
and this is us. They were stupid gun cops, representative of an agency 
known to be a cesspool of foul-ups. Weren't they called "F Troop" for a 
reason? We, on the other hand, are the best there is at what we do. The
size of our private-sector paychecks says so.</p>

<p>And on any level 
you wanted to examine it, the decision the Indian had made to go into 
the mine was a fatal error. Unless, Finley realized with a start, there 
WAS a way out.</p>

<p>The Indian was a local. This was his AO, his Area 
of Operations. If there was a way out of the mine, then Finley was the 
stupid one and not Charlie Quintard. An air shaft maybe?</p>

<p>Ahmed 
was examining the footprints as closely as he could from the safety of 
his side of the arch. Indeed, he recognized, they WERE the target's 
moccasins. The other trails he discounted as old from the weathering. 
The target was still alone. All the tracks went in, none came out. Why? 
Did they die inside? Was there another exit? He could read the same 
questions in Finley and Armando's faces across the way. Docker was 
behind him and facing away from the mine entrance, watching their backs 
as was his job.</p>

<p>Ahmed wanted his part of the million dollars, but
he wanted to stay alive more. He hated this part of Finley's infidel 
country. He didn't mind that it was hot. Iraq had been hot, hotter than 
this. But the humidity of this place made him feel like he was being 
drowned as well as baked. This was as bad as the worst of Africa or 
Central America. It was as Allah willed it, but Ahmed fervently wished 
Allah willed differently.</p>

<p>Ahmed was not a dutiful Muslim, but his
father had been and as he stared back in at the footprints again, he 
could hear his father's voice so long ago, reading one of Imam Zayn 
al-Abidin's Supplications:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many an oppressor has oppressed me with his tricks,<br/>
set up for me the net of his snares,<br/>
appointed over me the inspection of his regard,<br/>
and lay in ambush for me,<br/>
the lying in the ambush of a predator for its game,<br/>
waiting to take advantage of its prey,<br/>
while he showed me the smile of the flatterer<br/>
and looked at me with the intensity of fury!</p>

<p>So when Thou saw, my God,<br/>
(blessed art Thou and high exalted)<br/>
the depravity of his secret thoughts<br/>
and the ugliness of what he harboured,<br/>
Thou threw him on his head into his own pitfall<br/>
and dumped him into the hole of his own digging.<br/>
So he was brought down low, after his overbearing<br/>
by the nooses of his own snare,<br/>
wherein he thought he would see me;<br/>
and what came down down upon his courtyard<br/>
-- had it not been for Thy mercy --<br/>
was on the point of coming down upon me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There
was more, but Ahmed couldn't remember it. He had been on the verge of 
concluding there might be something suspicious about the moccasin 
prints, but now the more he stared at them the less he cared about them.
To hear his father's voice here, reading the Fourth Imam's wisdom, was a
sign, a talisman. "Thou threw him on his head into his own pitfall and 
dumped him into the hole of his own digging." What was this mine but 
that?</p>

<p>With a quarter million US dollars (he had no doubt that 
Finley would treat him fairly) plus what he had saved he could quit this
Allah cursed job in this Allah forsaken country and go back, if not 
home, maybe somewhere close. Lebanon? Even Libya looked good right now. 
He looked back at Finley with renewed confidence and zeal. Let's get 
this done.</p>

<p>Finley saw the look and nodded. Right, we've stood 
around here too long with our dicks in our hands. Let's take him. He 
hand signaled his decision to the other team members. Docker, who was 
too big to fit through the bars anyway, would stay here with the radio. 
Armando unburdened himself of it and set it on the ground. Docker would 
get it after the others were inside. The three of them couldn't fit 
through with their combat harnesses and body armor on so they took it 
all off and their patrol caps as well. They took out their PVS-14s from 
the protective cases, powered them up, checked them and then fitted the 
headbands securely, the units initially pivoted up and out of the way.</p>

<p>Ahmed
would enter first, covered by Docker and Finley. Once in, he would put 
his harness and armor back on, advance twenty yards down the shaft 
keeping tight up against the dank wall and then cover Armando and Finley
while they did the same. They began.</p>

<p>As Docker looked down the 
dark shaft, he was damned glad he was too big to enter. If he hadn't 
been, he would have invented an excuse to stay outside. This place gave 
him the bloody willies.</p>

<p>When he was little in South Armagh, he heard the Banshee one dark night. He'd never told a living soul, but he had.</p>

<p>Funny
thing that. In all his travels and adventures into bloody mayhem and 
organized murder, he'd been scared plenty of times -- no sane man 
wouldn't be -- but he'd never been as scared as he had been as a lad 
when he'd heard the Banshee's high keening moan right outside his 
window.</p>

<p>And truth be told, when there was a job to do, he'd never
before let his mind wander back to then. He was as smart an Orangeman 
as had ever drawn breath. That was why he was still alive. But just 
now, at this place, the Banshee's cries unhinged his logic, ravaged his 
memory and stole his courage. He shuddered. If the Banshee wasn't down 
that bloody great hole, then the Devil himself was and Patrick Docker 
was more than happy to stay right where he was. He'd get his cut of the 
million just the same.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Charlie's
breathing was under control now and, other than his eyes and ears 
straining, he did his very best to emulate a corpse. He laid on his back
just as he'd rolled over the stone into the erosion channel, the bow 
sticking into his ribs and spine like an iron rod. He didn't dare shift 
his weight. He felt ants crawling all over his bare feet.</p>

<p>He 
couldn't see anything of course, being down behind the keystone. When 
his ears heard the rustle and clunk of the body armor and harnesses 
coming off, the rip of the velcro, the shuffle of the boots, he knew 
they were going for it and couldn't believe his great good luck. When he
heard the muffled, receding crunch of the boots on wet coal dust, he 
knew he had won. He had been prepared, if discovered, to stand and rake 
them with the MAC-10 from above, trusting to God and his Cherokee 
ancestors to get them all before they got him. That hadn't been his 
plan.</p>

<p>His plan was to get them in Miller Mine and let the mine do
the rest. You see, Patrick Docker wasn't far wrong about the Devil 
himself being down that shaft. Charlie knew that because of his eleventh
grade science teacher, Mrs. Charlotte Wilson, and he blessed her now 
for the knowledge -- something he'd never thought he would do in a 
million years.</p>

<p>Part of the course requirements that year was a 
science fair project, and Mrs. Wilson being rather convinced of her own 
innate wisdom, selected the subjects for the students rather than 
letting them pick themselves. And poor Charlie Quintard, who couldn't 
have been interested in coal mines if he knew there were naked dancing 
ladies at the bottom of each and every one, drew "The Science of Coal 
Mine Safety." He didn't remember much about that project but he 
remembered this -- Miller Mine was closed down after repeated natural 
gas pockets had been hit.</p>

<p>Natural gas.</p>

<p>Colorless.</p>

<p>Odorless.</p>

<p>Explosive.</p>

<p>Gas.</p>

<p>There
had been explosions too. Men had died, choked or blown apart, it made 
no difference except to the undertaker. This accounted for the ghost 
stories associated with the mine. But even after it was closed, there 
had been one great explosion that blew the wooden bulkhead off the great
entrance.</p>

<p>A forest fire had raced across the top of the mountain
one dry fall day in the early Fifties, and sparks from the burning 
pines had somehow drifted down one of the airshafts, igniting a pocket 
of gas which blew the bulkhead to splinters. That was why, when it was 
replaced, they used a grate of rails that was welded together well away 
from the mouth of the mine, lifted into place with a crane and set in 
concrete. The gas could now more easily vent instead of building up.</p>

<p>Which didn't mean that it didn't keep trying.</p>

<p>Charlie
had been all over the mountain above Miller Mine, probably ten or 
twelve times in the past five or so years. He'd almost fallen into one 
of the old ventilation shafts on one of those jaunts. He knew where 
three of them were, including the nearest one which came out about 175 
feet above his head, angling down at about a 45 degree angle into the 
mountain. He knew he could get to it in a scramble up the slope, but 
first he had to deal with the man left outside, who was shifting and 
pacing below, alternately turning to watch the woods behind him, then 
straining to see down the shaft.</p>

<p>All this Charlie deduced from 
the sound alone. In his head, he choreographed his next move, and the 
seven moves that would follow after that. He needed to kill the man 
quietly and would have preferred his bow, but as it was pinned beneath 
him that was out of the question. To leap upon his quarry with knife or 
tomahawk was too risky. Too much chance of failure and he had to be SURE
of the man's quiet death in order to get the others as he planned.</p>

<p>He
could move his left arm silently far enough to explore the accumulated 
gravel and larger rocks which had been left in place when the soil 
eroded away around them. His hand found a tennis ball sized rock, left 
it, searched for something bigger, failed and came back to it. He heard 
the man mutter to himself, and based on that tenuous evidence Charlie 
concluded that his feet were closer to the man than his head. That 
wouldn't do. When Charlie Quintard rolled up on the capstone, he needed 
the man to be on the other side of the mine's mouth, out of sight of his
buddies working their way down it and looking away from him.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>Charlie took a quiet breath, let it part way out, and flipped the rock as hard as he could over his left shoulder.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Inside
the mine, Finley's hopes for a silent approach were shattered by the 
reality of the crunching wet coal dust, which seemed to thunder and echo
every time one of them took a step or shifted his weight. We're about 
as stealthy as a freight train, he thought angrily. The green glow of 
the night vision revealed nothing. Neither did the IR illuminators. This
place was dead. But the footprints still led away down the shaft, so 
they followed, slowly, cautiously, senses straining.</p>

<p>They were about a hundred yards down the shaft when Charlie flipped his rock.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When
it hit among the sparse vegetation on the left of the mine entrance, it
caused a small cascade of other loose stones and dirt. Docker's nerves,
stretched taught by his relived memories of the Banshee and heightened 
by the sounds coming out of the black maw of the mine (which sounded in 
his imagination like the Devil chewing bones), caused him to jump, 
spinning toward the sound and almost -- not quite, but almost -- making 
him put a bullet into the miniature landslide.</p>

<p>If he had, 
Charlie's plan would have been out the window. But the Irishman's finger
stayed outside the M-4's trigger guard as he had long ago learned, and 
he moved across the mine entrance over to the other side to scan up the 
hillside to see what might have caused it. When he did, Charlie had him.</p>

<p>Docker
spun at the sound behind and above him in time to hear the almost 
instantaneous "CLACK, PHHHT, CLICK" of the MAC on semi-auto. His last 
thought, and only a half-formed one at that, was that it wasn't the 
Banshee after all. The 230 grain bullet caught him just beneath the 
eyebrow of his left eye, ranged downward, snapped his cervical spine at 
the base of his skull as it exited and flipped him backwards.</p>

<p>The
IRA would remain forever disappointed that the Orangeman Docker had 
escaped their justice, which would have begun with an electric drill bit
through the knee and descended in civilized conduct from there.</p>

<p>All
standard .45 ACP loads are subsonic so there was no ballistic "crack!" 
-- just metal on metal of the bolt flying forward, chambering the round,
firing it and cycling to rear with a click as the sear caught it again.
In the shaft, deafened by their own crunching footsteps, the rest of 
the team heard nothing.</p>

<p>Damn, thought Charlie, Will Shipman was 
right about firearms having their place. Then he safed the MAC-10, 
pushed himself up off the stonework, took out his moccasins, placed them
on his feet and threw himself at the mountain, scrambling up for the 
air shaft.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Ahmed saw 
in his night vision that the footprints all abruptly stopped at the same
spot, a thrill of terror shot through him that not even Allah could 
have prevented. "The noose of his own snare," the Fourth Imam had said. 
We are all dead men, he thought dully. He turned to yell "Run!," but was
stopped by a clattering from up ahead.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Lungs
heaving, gut churning, legs pumping, arms alternately clutching 
hillside and vegetation, finding handholds, propelling himself upward, 
Charlie finally gained the first ventilation shaft opening. The grate 
which had once covered it had long since rusted away.</p>

<p>Clumsily, 
with bleeding fingers, he tore at the M-15 grenade, clawing the tape 
away from it and the grenade away from the strap. It was blue-grey in 
color with a yellow band and weighed just short of two pounds. The delay
on the fuze once the pin was pulled was supposed to be between 4 and 
4.8 seconds, although Charlie didn't know that, having never been in the
Army.</p>

<p>According to the accompanying note Shipman had given him, 
the smoke grenade was "to delay pursuit and make anybody chasing you 
think twice about getting close. Be sure you throw it far behind you 
toward the enemy and run like hell."</p>

<p>Charlie still didn't quite get that part. I mean, he thought, what's so scary about smoke?</p>

<p>The
only thing he was hoping was that, being a smoke grenade, it would 
burn, and the burning might set off the gas and take out his pursuers 
permanently. He pulled the pin with his left hand, and threw the grenade
down the shaft as hard as he could with his right, the spoon flying 
free, the striker hitting the primer on the fuze with a loud "POP!" It 
banged and clattered all the way down the shaft that had been cut so 
long ago in the stone.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Finley saw Ahmed turn, then freeze. Then he heard "pop" from a long way away and then the clatter coming closer.</p>

<p>Grenade.</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>Ahmed
ran past him. Armando's and Finley's reflexes and habits were more 
ingrained. When a grenade is thrown at you, you find cover. If you can't
find cover you throw yourself away from the grenade and down, putting 
the soles of your boots to the blast and hoping that the fragmentation 
blows over you, not into you. What you don't do is stand up and run away
like Ahmed. Finley was congratulating himself on just how much smarter 
he was than the Iraqi when the M-15 went off and he realized just how 
wrong he was about that and everything else.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
fuze, being almost sixty-five years old, burned a little longer than it
was designed to do. That was a good thing, because it meant the grenade
had time to drop deeper into the ventilation shaft and Charlie had time
to remember that he probably shouldn't be watching for it to quit 
sparking and start smoking.</p>

<p>He pulled his face away from the 
shaft opening and started to run down the hill on a tangent away from 
both the shaft and the entrance below.</p>

<p>Then the grenade went off 
with a huge boom, dwarfed and forgotten a half-second later as the gas 
in Miller Mine reached out to kill again with the blast wave of an 
atomic bomb simulation.</p>

<p>The Devil's own breath sought release, 
and then found it instantaneously out every ventilation shaft as well as
the main entrance. The fiery blast deafened Charlie and blew him down 
the mountain, ass over appetite. He broke a rib on the MAC and his right
leg on a large rock that got in his way. He came to rest tangled in 
some privet bushes, out like a light. All around Charlie's still form, 
rock slides large and small surrendered to gravity and cascaded down.</p>

<p>The
grenade had been a smoke grenade, sure enough, but not your everyday 
ordinary "pop smoke" grenade that Charlie had once seen in a war movie.</p>

<p>The
"WP" stood for White Phosphorous, the dreaded Willy Peter, the stuff 
that once it started burning produced prodigious amounts of smoke and 
kept on burning, even under water. Willy Peter did his duty that day and
taught Charlie just how much he didn't know about military 
pyrotechnics.</p>

<p>Inside the mine, the fire blazed on, cooking the 
bodies, drying and setting the coal dust on fire, and long after the 
flames ceased to flare from the openings, smoke still poured out. It 
would do so for weeks. The smoke could be seen a long, long ways away.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Just
before Jimmy Flynn hit the main highway in his flight away from Charlie
Quintard and the Brightfire mercenaries -- some ten minutes after it 
had begun -- the road went up a hill that overlooked a large area behind
him which had been logged. Something told him to stop here and see if 
he was really being followed.</p>

<p>He waited.</p>

<p>He wasn't.</p>

<p>And
the longer he waited, the more he repeated the events in his head, the 
more he reproached himself for leaving Charlie Quintard to the mercy of 
those murdering mercenary bastards.</p>

<p>He tried to raise Charlie on 
the radio. He couldn't. He tried to raise Will Shipman. He couldn't. The
chaos down in the valley was reaching its bloody denouement. OK, then, 
it was on Patrick Flynn's great grandson. He took the folding stock 
AK-74 out of the sports bag he carried it in and set it beside him on 
the passenger-side seat. Next to it, he deposited a five pocket Chinese 
shoulder-strapped pouch, containing thirty-round magazines loaded with 
5.45x39 7N6 Russian military ball.</p>

<p>Gathering his courage into his
own two hands, he turned the ambulance around and started to go back up
the mountain approaches. Before he got the ambulance back onto to the 
road, somebody turned off the main highway and pulled up next to him.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Barton
Meigs was as indignantly furious as he had ever been in his life. Or 
would ever be again, after he implemented the decision he had just made.
By now he knew of the deaths of the Sheriff and his deputies, of Peewee
Carpenter and his toady, of the WBRC reporter and of the four 
Brightfire mercenaries who had turned a bad day into the worst one of 
Barton Meigs' life. He also knew that the WBRC-6 cameraman and his 
footage were nowhere to be found, although the TV station van was still 
at Martin's Bait Shop. The shop owner had sworn the cameraman had just 
vanished along with some armed citizen who had helped the surviving 
deputy kill the Brightfire employees who had, apparently without cause, 
run amok.</p>

<p>It was imperative to get that footage before it was 
shown, he thought, but he knew it was a fool's errand. There would be no
tampering with this evidence. He had agents on their way to stake out 
the TV station in Birmingham, but he knew that they'd never get a chance
to seize the original.</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>Wearily Meigs looked up at his aide. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Sir,
the TV people are mostly here now in the briefing room downstairs. 
We're missing a couple of them but you wanted to know the soonest we 
could go with a statement and I think we can go with what we've got."</p>

<p>"OK," replied Meigs. The aide looked nervous. "Is there anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, uh, AD Atherton is holding for you. He demands that you talk to him before you speak to the press."</p>

<p>"Tell
him I'm on my way to the press conference, that you missed me, but that
I left this message for him." Meigs pulled out a piece of fancy ATF 
stationery with his vain-but-now-dead predecessor's name on it. He 
scribbled a couple of lines and handed it to his aide. He waited while 
the aide read it and watched his face go white.</p>

<p>"Clear?" demanded Meigs.</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said the aide, who paused and then said, "Actually, sir, I'm going to enjoy giving the AD this message."</p>

<p>"Good man. Now let me go forth and do the Lord's work this day."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Just a joke, son. A poor joke. And I think the joke's on me anyway."</p>

<p>Meigs left his office and his aide picked up the line.</p>

<p>"Meigs?" demanded Atherton before the aide had a chance to speak.</p>

<p>"No, Sir, this is Agent Winton."</p>

<p>"Put Meigs on, goddammit."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry sir, but he's already in the press conference, sir, but he did leave this message for you."</p>

<p>"That sonofabitch. What's the goddam message?"</p>

<p>"Well, its rather awkward, sir."</p>

<p>"Winton, just read me the goddam message or hit the goddam door."</p>

<p>"Er,
yes sir, well it reads, 'Tell Atherton thank you for his brilliant idea
of shoving these Brightfire maniacs down my throat and tell him I said 
to go f-ck himself in private. Tell him that if he doesn't know how to 
do that, then he can watch my press conference while I f-ck him myself 
in public.'"</p>

<p>Just before Winton heard the click on the other end,
he heard the AD whisper, "Oh my God." Winton, who was a good 
Episcopalian, doubted God was paying much attention to what AD Atherton 
said. He smiled a mournful smile, the most he could muster on such a 
horrible day, and left the office. He did not bother closing the door. 
He was looking for a new job tomorrow no matter what happened next.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It
was Jack Durer. He stopped the car, still halfway on the road, popped 
the trunk from the inside, got out, locked the doors and went to the 
trunk where he pulled out an M1928 Thompson submachine gun with Cutts 
compensator, fifty round drum and the whole nine yards. Durer also 
grabbed a baseball cap and a magazine pouch full of loaded 
thirty-rounders. He slammed the trunk lid and walked over to Jimmy who 
sat dumbfounded.</p>

<p>He had no idea who this old man was, but he 
didn't feel threatened. Durer was carrying the Thompson vertical to the
ground by the foregrip, with the ballcap over the muzzle. It was all 
just matter-of-fact. One guy transferring his weapon to another guy's 
car so they could drive to the range.</p>

<p>Flynn couldn't take his 
eyes off the Thompson, which he had only seen in the movies. Durer 
opened the passenger door and saw the AK-74.</p>

<p>"Here hold this." He
handed the Thompson to Jimmy, who took it gently, reverently, cradling 
it like a baby. It was beautiful, the lustrous wood, the gleaming blue. 
It was almost mint.</p>

<p>The ballcap fell into the floorboard. "And 
keep your finger off the trigger," he added sharply. Then, more 
matter-of-factly, "You mind if I move that out of the way?" Jack pointed
at the AK-74.</p>

<p>"Huh?" said Jimmy, his eyes still on the Thompson.
 He'd been shot at for the first time in his life that day and his 
brain still wasn't working very well. Jack Durer explained.</p>

<p>"I'm coming with you to rescue Charlie Quintard," said Durer as he put the 74 on the floorboard between the seats.</p>

<p>"Oh, uh, OK."</p>

<p>"I've got a good idea where he's at from Will Shipman, but why don't you tell me what's happened so far today?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah, Will, OK," stammered Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Here, son, let me take that off your hands before you get a hard on."</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh, yeah." Flynn handed the Chicago Piano back to Durer.</p>

<p>"I
never seen one before," marveled Jimmy, still astonished at the turn of
events and this apparition of an old man who appeared out of thin air 
at precisely where he was by accident..</p>

<p>"Well, son, I'm kinda old fashioned... If we get out of this alive, I'll let you shoot it some."</p>

<p>"I can?"</p>

<p>"I said, 'if'," Jack said flatly.</p>

<p>Then he added, more kindly but with a hint of exasperation, "Can you hand me my hat?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah," Jimmy groped around on the floor with his right hand and came up with it, and handed it to Durer.</p>

<p>"Thanks, son," and then he ordered, "Drive."</p>

<p>Jimmy put it back into gear and hit the accelerator.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And tell me what the hell's been happening up here."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Charlie
Quintard wished somebody would stop smashing his head flat with a 
sledgehammer. And can somebody please get that bayonet outta my ribs, 
and please, please stop stomping on my leg.</p>

<p>He came to slowly, 
painfully, still amazed at what his little smoke grenade had wrought. He
tried to roll over, to get up, do anything but couldn't. Pinned in 
place by his pain and the privet. And the only thing he could hear was 
ringing, ringing, ringing, ringing.</p>

<p>"Can somebody stop that shit too?" he asked aloud plaintively. He didn't hear his own voice for the ringing.</p>

<p>The wind shifted and smoke blew across his little half-acre of Hell. Charlie choked and then immediately wished he hadn't.</p>

<p>Oh God above, please, my head. Please.</p>

<p>He passed out again.</p>

<p>When
he next awoke, an old man and a young kid were carrying him down the 
hillside strapped to a litter. The were both strangers. Well, maybe he'd
seen the kid somewhere, but he couldn't place him. They both carried 
long arms in addition to him, slung over their backs. An AK and was that
a Thompson? Must be militia, he thought, then lost consciousness 
again.</p>

<p>He woke up in the back of a dark shell. It looked Army 
with dark green paint. Far away down a tinny reverberating well, the old
man was telling the younger one something about a Humvee, a body, 
something had to be moved. Once more he gave over to the dark. Then, 
later, he was bouncing again down the hill. Oh God. OH GOD! Make it 
stop.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. No he wasn't on the hill, he was 
bouncing around in the shell. When the bouncing turned his head, he 
shrieked in pain and then shrieked again when he saw the man he'd killed
at the mouth of the mine laying beside him. Was he in Hell? Why was 
this dead guy following him around?</p>

<p>Before he could form an answer, once again, he passed out.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Finally,
they were back at Jack Durer's car. They had been lucky, although both 
were exhausted, spent. You know, thought Jack, people say this all the 
time, but I REALLY AM TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.</p>

<p>They'd been lucky 
with the keys. Like every competent team leader, the mercenary had 
insisted that all of his team members each carry a spare set of keys to 
their vehicle. The body was a real pain-in-the-ass inconvenience, but 
they couldn't leave it there with a .45 hole in its eye and forensic 
clues littered about. Better to add another chapter to the mystery of 
Big Bad Charlie Quintard.</p>

<p>They'd found the keys in the big dead 
man's pocket, gone back to the Humvee, moved it up to the Miller Mine 
using the overgrown railroad right of way. They left the Humvee like 
they found it, but took the remains of the radio, Docker and all his 
kit.</p>

<p>They left the Humvee, in fact, like the Brightfire team had 
just stepped out of it, walked in and blew themselves up in a mine that 
everybody around here with any sense knew was full of natural gas.</p>

<p>Jack
liked the kid's idea for disposing of the body. He even understood the 
classical reference that occasioned it. And it would provide good cover 
if the kid were stopped at a roadblock, if his guts and his cover story 
held up. An ambulance in a hurry had to have casualties aboard.</p>

<p>A
good day's work, if you could call such butchery in a cause good. He'd 
heard about the innocents who'd died, even about the sixteen year old 
kid, who even if she made it, would curse her lot the rest of her days. 
He knew that he bore more than a little responsibility for that... 
for arranging this evil day. Still, he told himself the old lie that 
he'd told himself all his life.</p>

<p>Yeah, you got some people killed 
but you saved many more lives than that by doing so. He told himself 
that, but deep down he wasn't sure he believed it any more. It still 
hurt. May God forgive me.</p>

<p>Jack Durer took his Thompson and his 
mag pouch and his exhausted old carcass and put them all in their proper
places in his car. It would be a long drive home. He had changed 
history again today, by just a little bit.</p>

<p>He hoped it was enough.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Jimmy
Flynn, knowing now what he had to do and wondering if he'd ever see 
another M1928 Thompson again, immediately took off down the main road 
with his red lights running and his siren blowing. And as he drove he 
began to sing with the ebullience and elation that only those who have 
danced with death and lived can understand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tim Finnegan lived in Walken Street, a gentle Irishman mighty odd<br/>
He had a brogue both rich and sweet, an' to rise in the world he carried a hod.<br/>
You see he'd a sort of tippler's way, but the love for the liquor poor Tim was born.<br/>
To help him on his way each day, he'd a drop of the craythur every morn.</p>

<p>Whack fol the dah now dance to yer partner, around the flure yer trotters shake<br/>
Wasn't it the truth I told ye? Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake.</p>

<p>One morning Tim got rather full, his head felt heavy which made him shake<br/>
Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull, and they carried him home his corpse to wake<br/>
Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet, and laid him out upon the bed<br/>
A bottle of whisky at his feet and a barrel of porter at his head.</p>

<p>Whack fol the dah now dance to yer partner, around the flure yer trotters shake<br/>
Wasn't it the truth I told ye? Lots of fun at...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh shit. Flashing blue lights. Roadblock ahead.</p>

<p>Jimmy began to brake.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Every
eye in the room was on Barton Meigs. This was a press conference like 
none that the ATF had ever held. Meigs was saying that innocents had 
died this day in Winston County and that the ATF was responsible for 
them. He had taken responsibility for the killings. Incredible. It was 
said the Birmingham ambulance-chasing trial lawyers were already 
flocking to the funeral homes.</p>

<p>The rumor was that an ABC 
affiliate had footage of the murders, yes, MURDERS, of Winston County 
law enforcement officers at the hands of Brightfire contractors working 
for ATF. The national network had certainly preempted two hours of prime
time tonight for a special. Rumor was, the Governor of Alabama was 
going to serve notice that all Brightfire employees AND ATF agents were 
being ordered to leave the state immediately. Rumor was, the Attorney 
General of Alabama was going to charge the entire Brightfire corporate 
chain of command with conspiracy to murder.</p>

<p>I have ordered that 
all Brightfire employees in my region cease operations immediately. I 
want everyone to understand they have no authority from me to act in any
capacity under their old contracts. I hereby revoke them unilaterally 
and call on my superiors to ratify my decision. They no longer have any 
legal authority to conduct operations of any kind in my region. If they 
continue to do so, I hope that law enforcement agencies at every level 
will apprehend them as the criminals and outlaws that they have proven 
themselves to be.</p>

<p>I have, to the extent that it is possible at my
paygrade, initiated a full agency investigation of the circumstances of
this tragedy and further, I have sent letters to the President, the 
appropriate congressional oversight committees and the Office of 
Professional Responsibility and the Inspector General's Office at 
Justice, to conduct independent inquiries asking that they whitewash 
nothing.</p>

<p>I will tell you now, before any investigation compels me
to do so, that I was directed, no, ordered, by Assistant Director 
Atherton, over my objections, to accept Brightfire employees in lieu of 
trained federal law enforcement agents. I believe that the innocent 
blood that was shed this day in Winston County, Alabama is on his hands 
as much as any other man's. As far as who may have ordered him to do so,
you must seek answers higher up. I hope the investigations that surely 
will come will find out.</p>

<p>Finally, I'd like to say this. I have 
worked all my life for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives. I have been mostly proud of my agency over the years. I say 
mostly proud because we have been given a difficult, unpopular job by 
the elected representatives of this nation without much thought on their
part as to how we might carry out their whims, some of which frankly 
make no sense. Over the years, my agency like every other human agency 
on earth, has made mistakes. But in recent years, we have been made into
a bully boy agency by politicians who wish to engineer social control 
on the cheap against the will of a substantial number of the people. In
the process, some of my fellow agents, and especially some of our 
higher management, have lost sight of the oaths we took when we signed 
on.</p>

<p>It was in this spirit that my predecessor in this job 
targeted Phil Gordon for enforcement action. I have read all the 
surviving files on Phil Gordon. I believe he was targeted for his 
opinions, not for any violation of law he may have committed before he 
found out he was being targeted. I believe that Mr. Gordon felt, as many
of our people have felt over the years, that the federal government has
gotten too big for its britches and too unaccountable for its mistakes.
I think that Mr. Gordon believed, in the light of some recent cases, 
that he could no longer get a fair trial in the federal courts of this 
country.</p>

<p>I do not condone what Phil Gordon did. Many of the 
agents killed that terrible day on Sipsey Street were my friends, some 
of them lifelong friends, and I grieve for them still. I grieve for 
their wives and their children and for the terrible loss of their future
contributions to this nation. But while I do not condone what Phil 
Gordon did, in the light of this day's bloody events, I better 
understand him.</p>

<p>I end by begging you all, my fellow Americans, 
whether you be community leaders, politicians, law enforcement officers 
or just citizens... I beg you all, let us back up for a moment, take a
deep breath and try to reason our way through this crisis before it is 
too late.</p>

<p>As for me, I have given notice that I will be resigning
my duties in two weeks so that I may work on my legal defense in the 
cases that are sure to arise from this tragedy and for failing in my 
responsibility to keep it from happening. Thank you.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In
the headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland, the Captain switched off the 
press conference. The Major General, lost in thoughts of childhood, 
pressed his fingers to his eyes, fighting tears.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the 
Captain, "you must be very proud of your brother." The Major General 
didn't look up, but said in a husky voice, "Well, I never was much 
before, but I sure as hell am now."</p>

<p>The Captain, understanding that he had been dismissed, said, "Goodnight, sir."</p>

<p>"Goodnight."</p>

<p>When the Captain closed the door, the general let the tears roll down. "Well done, Bartie. Well done," he whispered.</p>

<hr/>

<p>AD
Atherton snapped off the television in his Washington office. "He's a 
dead man walking. If I do nothing else before I leave this office, I'm 
going to make sure of that."</p>

<p>The President of Brightfire replied mildly, "Well, you never can tell what might happen."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Jimmy Flynn came to a stop. Art Looney, senior deputy and now acting Sheriff as of an hour ago, walked up to the ambulance.</p>

<p>"Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Art
Looney looked a lot older than Jimmy ever remembered him being. He 
would have thought it weird had he known, but Art Looney thought the 
same of him.</p>

<p>"I was hopin' you'd come this way," said Art. He 
paused, and then smiled. "OK, pass friend." He motioned the ambulance 
forward, and turned to the roadblock.</p>

<p>"OPEN UP!" Looney ordered his men.</p>

<p>A cruiser began to roll aside, making an opening.</p>

<p>"And Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Kill the lights and the siren. You're just drawing attention to yourself."</p>

<p>"YES, SIR!" He saluted and Art Looney laughed as the kid eased the ambulance through the roadblock.</p>

<p>There
was one thing Sheriff Carter Johnson had been wrong about. Skeeter 
Haynes wasn't going to win that primary after all. After today, Arthur 
Curtis Looney had decided he was going to run for the job. And after 
today, he would win.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Well, it was done.</p>

<p>Charlie Quintard had been delivered to the safe house.</p>

<p>He
would be OK, though his convalescence would take a while. The doctor 
was sure of that. Will had no fear of the doctor speaking outside of 
church. He was his cousin, and a Shipman. In Winston County, that's 
all you had to know.</p>

<p>Will Shipman had also made certain of another thing.</p>

<p>A new coon dog pup, just weaned, awaited Charlie there.</p>

<p>He's
been through hell, Shipman knew, but this ain't over yet, not by a long
shot, and they would need Charlie Quintard. His state, his country, 
would need him. Although how you defined that country after today might 
differ with your proximity to its events.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The
big dead mercenary was where he had belonged all along and Jimmy Flynn 
was slamming the doors on the ambulance and about to be on his way back 
to the Winston County Volunteer Search and Rescue building in Double 
Springs.</p>

<p>He'd called Katy to let her know he was all right. After
all the killing she'd been worried to death. She told him about the ABC
special that was due to come on any minute and promised him she'd save 
it on disc for him.</p>

<p>"I love you, Jimmy," she said.</p>

<p>"I love you too, baby. I'll call you when I get home."</p>

<p>He
looked down one last time at the dead merc. He'd been stripped of every
stitch of clothing and was as naked as the day he came into the world 
in South Armagh, Northern Ireland. He wouldn't have to fear Banshees any
more, though Jimmy wondered if maybe he hadn't gone to the place where 
Banshees ruled the night that never ended.</p>

<p>But wherever he was, this was the perfect ending for him today.</p>

<p>What was it that Will Shipman had said?</p>

<p>"<i>Dulce et decorum est</i>," I think.</p>

<p>Anyway,
it meant "it is sweet and fitting." Shipman had told him some months 
ago about a book that had been written back the 90s, a fiction book by a
guy named John Ross, about the ATF pickin' on the wrong guy, just like 
they did Phil Gordon in real life. Anyway, this guy had a way of gettin'
rid of the bodies.</p>

<p>He fed 'em to the hogs.</p>

<p>And Jimmy had 
just dumped the Brightfire mercenary's mortal remains right in the 
middle of a wild hog wallow on the back forty of an abandoned farm just 
south of the Bankhead National Forest. He could hear the boars grunting 
in the brush out past the illumination of the ambulance's headlights not
a hundred yards away. Well, they're shy, he thought. They'll be 
needin' me out of the way before they dine.</p>

<p>"Eat hearty, boys an' girls," he called, and he hopped back in the driver's seat and drove off.</p>

<p>That night the herd dined on foreign food. Exotic, but still tasty and quite filling.</p>

<p>And as he drove back home, Jimmy picked up the song:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His friends assembled at the wake, and Mrs Finnegan called for lunch.<br/>
First she brought in tay and cake, then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch.<br/>
Biddy O'Brien began to cry, "Such a clean corpse, did you ever see,<br/>
Tim avourneen, why did you die?" "Will ye hold yer gob?" said Paddy McGee.</p>

<p>Whack fol the dah now dance to yer partner, around the flure yer trotters shake<br/>
Wasn't it the truth I told ye? Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake.</p>

<p>Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job, "Biddie," says she, "You're wrong, I'm sure."<br/>
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob and left her sprawling on the floor.<br/>
Then the war did soon engage, t'was woman to woman and man to man<br/>
Shillelagh law was all the rage and a row and ruction soon began.</p>

<p>Whack fol the dah now dance to yer partner, around the flure yer trotters shake<br/>
Wasn't it the truth I told ye? Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake!</p>

<p>Mickey Maloney ducked his head when a bucket of whisky flew at him.<br/>

<p>Jimmy
Flynn laughed, remembering Charlie Quintard's delivery to the 
safehouse. The beat up Indian had roused from his headache and 
concussion long enough to look around and ask, "What's your name?"</p>

<p>Jimmy Flynn didn't know if they should be using real names just now so he said, "Mickey Maloney."</p>

<p>"Huh?" said Charley, "you'll have to speak louder." The effort damn near made him pass out.</p>

<p>So Jimmy shouted, "Mickey Maloney!" with a grin. Then impulsively he added loudly, "I'm the guy who ducked the pail of whisky."</p>

<p>Huh? Whisky? That damn ringing. Had he heard that right? Charlie started to ask, but then had a better question.</p>

<p>"And the old guy, who was he?"</p>

<p>"Why that was Paddy McGee!"</p>

<p>Jimmy Flynn paused. Then he shouted in a badly-faked brogue, "And yer bloody Tim Finnegan! Welcome back to the living!"</p>

<p>Charlie
closed his eyes then. His brain just couldn't take the confusion right 
now. He was asleep before Jimmy Flynn turned to go.</p>

<p>Taking his 
leave of Mrs. Walker, who would care for Charlie these first few weeks 
in her cabin way up in hills of nearby Walker County, he had walked out 
the door, laughing.</p>

<p>He was whistling "Finnegan's Wake."</p>

<p>Ten
days later, Barton Meigs was found dead of a heart attack in his office
in Nashville. He had been cleaning out his desk. The agency had refused
his resignation. He had been fired and action was in the works to strip
his family of his pension. Oddly, there was a mixup at the Nashville 
morgue and his body was cremated in error. They were very sorry for the 
mistake.</p>

<p>William Winton, his former aide, said that he'd died of a broken heart for an agency he had loved.</p>

<p>Barton Meigs' brother knew it was murder.</p>

<p>Three
days after Barton's ashes were scattered over Winston County, Alabama 
by his brother -- a place neither of the Meigs boys had ever been to or 
even thought about before the Battle of Sipsey Street -- Jack Durer got a
private message from a mutual friend asking that he discreetly contact a
certain active duty Major General.</p>

<p>He had some things to discuss bearing upon the peace and security of a southern state.</p>

"Fire
 without movement is indecisive. Exposed movement without fire is 
disastrous. There must be effective fire combined with skillful 
movement." -- <i>Marine Rifle Squad, Fleet Marine Force Manual 6-5</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Students
of Marine Corps tactics are taught that the smallest tactical and 
maneuver element in the Corps is the fire team. Many combat-tested squad
leaders, however ' might regularly dispute this contention. As a 
newly-arrived platoon commander in Vietnam, I ordered fire team rushes 
during the heat of one of my first contacts. I was subsequently amazed 
to watch a lone figure burst forth from the squad on my left, and I 
rushed to query the squad leader concerning his understanding of my 
orders.</p>

<p>"THAT," he answered, "WAS my first fire team."</p>

<p>This
experience, although humorous in retrospect, was by no means unique. It
probably was more common than being blessed with a continual full 
complement of Marines. In fact, its very frequency serves to cast 
aspersions upon the effectiveness of the fire team. If a fire team 
sustains only two casualties, or even one in some instances, it simply 
ceases to exist as a tactical or maneuver unit. Thus it seems that this 
vital link, which provides the foundation for our entire tactical and 
administrative structure, lacks the flexibility to function properly at 
less than full strength.</p>

<h4>An Embarrassment of Riches</h4>

<p>Bill
Curtis' squad had started out as just two friends getting ready for 
uncertain times. That was back in the Nineties, after Waco. It was just 
Bill and his friend Denny Powell. One buddy team. Friends in high 
school, both of them were now veterans. They'd come home after Desert 
Storm and left the rapidly downsizing military -- Bill had been Army, 
Denny had been a Marine -- to take up wives and civilian careers in 
their native home, Double Springs, Alabama.</p>

<p>Now they each had 
teenage sons, two of whom also shouldered weapons in the squad. That was
the way it was with militia, a confluence of like-minded friends, 
bolstered by family. There were folks who allowed themselves to be 
paralyzed by fear of linking up with others, worried (and not 
necessarily irrationally) about federal snitches, <i>provocateurs</i>, or just garden-variety nut-burgers.</p>

<p>Not
Bill and Denny. They'd had their share of experiences with all three 
over the years, but they just kept on training and building their unit, 
staying legal, keeping their eyes focused on creating skilled riflemen. 
It probably helped that they each had lots of cousins. You didn't have 
to vet somebody you'd known all your life. There were four cousins in 
the squad.</p>

<p>But the rest were just friends or neighbors they met 
over coffee at school events, talking politics, finding like minds and, 
more importantly, people willing to do something more than talk. They'd 
started out with just a buddy team, themselves, and then found another 
couple of hunters who had the same idea. Another buddy team plus theirs 
and now they had a fire team. It was pure dumb luck that they ran into 
another bunch of guys training in the Bankhead National Forest one 
weekend in 1996. One pickup truck of camo-painted faces carrying rifles 
met three more pickup trucks of camo-painted faces carrying paintball 
guns and of course they'd stopped to ask questions.</p>

<p>The 
"commander" of that bunch hadn't been able to do a thing when Bill and 
Denny cherry-picked his unit of the best and the brightest. The squad's 
training was far more challenging and focused than paintball games, and 
it attracted the more motivated. Over the years, the unit had waxed and 
waned, dropping men who fell out because of changing circumstances or, 
more often, the demands of their wives.</p>

<p>Bill and Denny tried hard
to make sure the wives of their people were happy, and that they 
networked with other spouses so the FTX weekends wouldn't be dead time 
for them. Cheryl, Bill's wife, and Clarisse, Denny's better half, had 
helped immensely with that. As Cheryl told him with a tinge of 
exasperation, "You know, we wives get together out of self-defense. If 
you're going to run off every other weekend and play soldier, the least 
we can do is have as much fun as you are," adding, "and when did you say
you're going to get around to cleaning the gutters?"</p>

<p>If somebody
needed time off to deal with a home situation, nobody ragged him. And 
for the most part, they always came back. Bill had a policy, "Don't 
shoot the wounded." Even when a guy didn't come back to the squad, they 
always parted as friends.</p>

<p>After Y2K and the passing of the 
Clintonistas from the national political stage, more men dropped out 
because they thought the threat had evaporated with the political 
retirement of the Great Fornicator. But with the election of the current
president, and especially after the Battle of Sipsey Street, events had
once again conspired to bring the old volunteers back, bringing 
younger, newer ones with them.</p>

<p>What was it Ben Franklin had said?</p>

<p>"Nothing concentrates the mind so wonderfully as the prospect of being hung in the morning."</p>

<p>Of
course they had always been friendly with Will Shipman's bunch and had 
trained with them from time to time. But Bill's squad always considered 
themselves a cut above Will's unit because they had tighter standards 
and were more physically fit. Fitness was the key to living in combat, 
Bill knew, and he insisted upon it.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to keep you alive," he'd said to the complainers. "And me too."</p>

<p>It
had been a constant struggle, though, and he had probably lost more 
volunteers from inability or unwillingness to physically hack the 
training than any other single cause. Bill had to admit that even for 
him it was HARD to motivate yourself when there didn't seem to be threat
looming on the horizon.</p>

<p>Now, however, he didn't have that problem.</p>

<p>Now events had managed to grab all of their attention.</p>

<p>In
fact, the new volunteers scared up by the current crisis had allowed 
him to spin off another squad of the guys who were too old, too young, 
too out-of-shape, or who had health conditions of one kind or another. 
He'd organized them into a something like a logistics and support unit 
and given command of it to John Stentinius, a Marine veteran of Vietnam 
and Lebanon with an artificial leg to replace the one he'd lost in the 
Embassy bombing and who had more grit, gumption, and brains than the 
rest of them combined. John now had his people busy extending and 
improving the system of supply caches that Bill and Denny had started 
back in the Nineties in the Forest, and up in the Sipsey Wilderness 
area. They were also working on getting communications links of various 
kinds up and running.</p>

<p>He'd had to transfer some of his old 
friends to the support element, and none of them had liked it very much.
But there were plenty of young, experienced soldiers and Marines back 
from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who were far better suited for 
what was coming. It was no shame to admit the ravages of time, he'd told
the old guys, but they had hated it all the same.</p>

<p>Even so, if 
the volunteers kept coming in at this rate, he could have another 
combat-ready squad in a month, maybe less. He'd probably give command of
that to one of the experienced newbies, Mike Parker probably. Parker 
had come back from Iraq with a Silver Star and the rest of the men 
looked up at him as a demi-god of war, which he damn near was.</p>

<p>He certainly was a competent squad leader, Bill thought, probably -- no, positively -- better than me.</p>

<p>Besides,
Bill and Denny were like an old married couple by now. They'd had every
argument they could possibly have and had still remained friends, and 
Bill didn't know what he'd do without Denny as assistant squad leader. 
But if they grew much bigger, eventually Bill was going to be a platoon 
leader not a squad leader, and then what would he do with Denny?</p>

<p>The
first real argument they'd had, Bill recalled, was over the size of the
squad. Denny had insisted that if they ever got big enough, they should
organize along the lines of a Marine rifle squad -- three four-man fire
teams and a squad leader. Bill, thinking that they'd never get that big
anyway, had a preference for the smaller Army squad.</p>

<p>"We won't 
have any support weapons," Denny had argued, "we'll need all the 
shooters we can get." And he'd added, "Besides, if we think small, we'll
always BE small. We ought to try to grow this as big as we can."</p>

<p>It
had all been merely academic until they finally did get that big, but 
Bill eventually had conceded Denny's point. They would use the proven 
triangular Marine system -- one attacking, two providing cover fire and 
security -- and they would concentrate on making competent riflemen who 
could move, communicate and most of all shoot, dealing out deadly, 
aimed, semiautomatic fire.</p>

<p>Of course they were hampered initially
by the miscellany of weaponry the volunteers brought to the task. Deer 
rifles, shotguns, SKS's, Garands, AR and AK clones - you name it. It was
a logistician's nightmare -- and a small unit commander's, if he cared 
about standardization and the benefits that it brought in combat -- 
which Bill did.</p>

<p>It was better now. Over the years the committed 
men of his squad -- and those who'd stayed were ALL committed -- had 
worked, scrimped and saved to buy better, more capable weapons. The best
shot in each fire team was a dedicated marksman now with a semi-auto 
rifle in 7.62 NATO or .30-06. The 7.62x39 ammo famine had been one more 
reason to leave the SKS's and AK's in the gun safes at home, although 
one fire team had merely swapped out their AK-47s for AK-74s in 5.45x39,
which was still available and relatively cheap, although "relatively" 
and "cheap" were two words of decreasing importance these days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At
the outset of World War II, the Marine rifle squad was composed of 12 
men, with no particular internal organization. This setup literally came
under fire early in that war, as it proved immensely difficult for a 
squad leader to maintain control over as many as 11 men at one time. 
Therefore, after a number of attempts to rectify the I e situation, our 
present fire team organization was instituted in 1944. It has a number 
of advantages over the former system, and has been widely heralded due 
to its "triangular concept" which offers maximum control, 
maneuverability, and firepower. indeed, when compared to the "12-man 
mob" its advantages in these areas are striking:</p>

<p>Control. This 
was perhaps the greatest advantage of the new system as the squad leader
had three subordinate leaders in his span of control instead of 11 men.
This produced more effective supervision.</p>

<p>Maneuverability. With 
the creation of a Four man fire team, a smaller tactical unit capable of
independent maneuver evolved. This served to eliminate the spur of the 
moment "you take Smith and Jones and go over there" approach and 
ostensibly brought into existence a bonafide maneuver element below the 
squad level.</p>

<p>Firepower. The fire team was created to gain maximum
employment of the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). in fact, the whole 
fire team concept was built around the BAR, which provided the nucleus 
of the team's firepower. Fire team formations were designed to protect 
the automatic rifleman, and one rifleman was assigned a secondary 
mission of aiding the automatic rifleman in, finding targets and 
reloading magazines.</p>

<p>This arrangement was highly successful in 
exploiting the BAR (and later the M-14 automatic) to full advantage; the
maximum use and protection of the automatic rifle seems to be the main 
justification behind the present fire team concept. With the advent of 
the M-16, however, this nucleus of the fire team has disappeared. Now 
there may be justification for reorganization. In this regard, it is 
recognized that Marine Corps planners are searching for a heavy 
automatic weapon which would provide the fire team with the same type of
firepower that the BAR and M-14 automatic did; however, two points must
necessarily be made concerning this. First, there is currently no such 
weapon in use, and no positive guarantee that one will be found, while 
the M-16 is currently being used. And secondly, instead of finding a new
automatic rifle of this type, perhaps a better solution would be to 
retain the M-16 and reorganize the fire team.</p>

<p>But
now, thanks to the influx of new volunteers, some of them very 
experienced in the ways of war, and Will Shipman's largesse, Bill was 
faced with an embarrassment of riches. Who could have believed in the 
early years of this decade, when they were scraping by with doing 
mini-FTXs with six guys armed with whatever they could scrape together, 
that he would have <i>this</i> problem?</p>

<h4>"Bee-A-Are"</h4>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/BAR.gif" alt="Browing Automatic Rifle" width='400' height='127'/></p>

<p>You
may not be armed now with a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle M1918A2), but
you are expected to know all about the weapon, because your fire team 
is built around it. Your squad is built upon its teams. If your team's 
BAR man is knocked out, the weapon must be manned and this assignment 
may fall to you. You have to grab that BAR and get it into operation. 
You have to keep it in operation. You will be the BAR man. At present, 
there are three Browning Automatic Rifles assigned to each rifle squad, 
with nine in a rifle platoon. This gives each company 27 BARs. Because 
these weapons are light, maneuverable, and have great firepower, they 
are the most vital weapons of your platoon. You must learn all about the
BAR now as future insurance.</span> -- "The Automatic Rifle," Guidebook for Marines, Chapter 15, 1 May 1948, p. 163. </span></p>

<p>They'd met, seemingly by chance, at the Double Springs Tastee Freeze.</p>

<p>Will
Shipman's invitation had been intriguing: "Come on by the house after 
work and bring your pickup truck with the cap on it. I've got something 
for you. Oh, yeah, and bring a couple of your best guys."</p>

<p>That was all, and he wouldn't elaborate.</p>

<p>It
was three days after what the press was calling "The Winston County 
Massacre." By order of the Governor, the ATF and Brightfire thugs were 
gone, replaced by Winston County sheriff deputies and Alabama state 
troopers. Those few federal undercover agents still in place wore ABI 
surveillance that was as close and intimate as their underwear.</p>

<p>The feds no longer ruled Winston County.</p>

<p>Will
was waiting for Bill and his boys on the porch when they drove up. 
"Drive around to the barn," he called out to them. "I'll be with you in a
minute." They were out of the truck by the time Will came around the 
house and Bill started to ask what this was all about.</p>

<p>Will cut him off with an upraised palm.</p>

<p>"Please
hold all questions until the end of the presentation," imitating the 
voice of Wilson Shropshire, the Double Springs High School principal who
had served for three decades before passing away of a heart attack at 
his desk. They all recognized their old principal's measured tones and 
laughed.</p>

<p>Will unlocked the high-security padlock on the sliding 
door. That's new, thought Bill. "All right, boys," Will said as he slid 
back the big door, "come on in and shut the door behind you." He walked 
over to the light switch and gave it a flick. Overhead flourescents 
flickered into brilliance. Bill Curtis and Denny Powell followed Will 
in. Mike Parker turned and slid the door shut.</p>

<p>Mike Parker 
whistled softly. The barn was packed with crates, Bill saw. No, not just
crates, military crates. Some had tarps over them and some had recent 
spray black paint over the markings. What the...</p>

<p>Will turned to face Bill Curtis. "How big is your unit now, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Total? About 32, with more coming in every day," Curtis answered. "The ATF and Brightfire are really great recruiters for us."</p>

<p>Shipman nodded. "You know, Bill, I always appreciated the fact that you grew your own unit and never tried to cherry-pick mine."</p>

<p>Curtis answered with a smile, "That's because I figured you'd beat the hell out of me if I tried."</p>

<p>"You're right. I would have. But we've both cooperated for so long I think of y'all as my own."</p>

<p>Curtis
started to open his mouth and Will Shipman saw the objection coming. 
"Don't get your panties in a wad. I'm not trying to take over your unit,
although the time may come soon when you'll want me to. Let's just say 
for right now that we're brothers in arms and I can stand having you 
better armed, is all. We've both got plenty of enemies out there, don't 
you think? DOMESTIC enemies?"</p>

<p>Overcome by curiosity about what 
was in the crates, Bill was going to let slide that crack about wanting 
Will to take over. So he merely replied, "Yeah, they buried the Sheriff 
today on account of some of those domestic enemies."</p>

<p>Will nodded again. "I went to the funeral." The Sheriff and his two deputies were buried in a common ceremony.</p>

<p>Almost all of the county and half the state had turned out for it. The Governor was even there. So was Jack Durer.</p>

<p>Will
continued, "Anyway, I've got some presents for you and your boys. It's 
time to spread around the Shipman family fortune, I think."</p>

<p>Bill Curtis was fit to bust. "Quit beatin' around the bush, Shipman, and tell me what's on your mind."</p>

<p>Shipman
grinned and turned to a shorter stack of crates in front of the others.
"This," he said as he pulled the tarp off, "is what's on my mind."</p>

<p>On top of the stack of crates was twenty pounds of parkerized steel and gleaming, linseed oil-soaked wood on a bipod.</p>

<p>The
three men gaped at the sight. Finally, Bill Curtis said, 
"Whole-E-SHIT." It wasn't an exclamation, as much as a benediction. Mike
Parker added, "That's a fact." They all moved forward to look at it, 
but nobody wanted to touch it, lest the mirage disappear.</p>

<p>Shipman
smiled indulgently, like a dime store Santa Claus at a bunch of 
goggle-eyed kids. "This, my friends, is an M1918A2 Browning Automatic 
Rifle manufactured by the International Business Machines Corporation in
1944. It is new and fresh out of the cosmoline. I've got magazines and 
ammunition to go with it."</p>

<p>Mike Parker jumped on that. "How many mags? How much ammunition?"</p>

<p>Shipman
replied, "For you? Twenty magazines and 2000 rounds of ball in 
bandoleers and stripper clips per rifle." He added, "I've also got web 
gear to go with each BAR."</p>

<p>Parker whistled again, and then asked the last, vital question. "How many rifles are you going to let us have?"</p>

<p>"Well,
I've been thinkin' on that. Allowin' for your unit growin' and all, 
plus maybe puttin' some ammo and rifles in caches for back up, I figured
on ten. If you grow your unit some later, there's more where these came
from."</p>

<p>"How many more?" asked Parker.</p>

<p>"There's a hundred total, counting these."</p>

<p>Bill Curtis said the only thing he could think of. "Well, shit and shove me in it."</p>

<p>Shipman laughed. "If you insist. I've got a manure pile out back that's handy."</p>

<p>Denny Powell finally recovered his voice. "Where in the name of God..."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Will Shipman slowly, "that's a long story."</p>

<p>So he told them about the preacher's son, the deacon and the boxcar. He gave them the short version.</p>

<p>When
Will was finished, Bill Curtis looked at the BAR again, longingly, 
lovingly. In wonder, he said again, "Well, shit and shove me in it."</p>

<p>"There's more," Shipman offered.</p>

<p>"What?" asked all three men at once, as if on cue.</p>

<p>"Hand
grenades. Old World War II frags, but they work. Some M15 Willy Peter 
smokes. Rifle grenades. High Explosive Anti-Tank dual purpose and Willy 
Peters. Springfield rifles with attachments to launch 'em and the blank 
cartridges to make 'em fly. You can have ten Springfields, too. That's a
case of them right there," Will said as he pointed at the bottom of the
stack of crates. "And another 10,000 rounds of ammo to go with 'em. 
It's corrosive of course, and you'll have to be scrupulous about 
cleanin' the weapons, but it's got one advantage over modern 
non-corrosive."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Mike Parker.</p>

<p>"It's free, son," replied Shipman, "it's all free."</p>

<p>Bill
Curtis knew enough to look a gift horse in the mouth. "And what will 
you be wantin', Will Shipman, in payment for all these 'free' toys?" He 
knew the answer, but he wanted to hear it from Will's own mouth.</p>

<p>Will
looked offended, then smiled craftily, and then, he turned deadly 
serious. "What I want, Billy Curtis, is for you and your bunch to come 
runnin' if me and mine get hit. Just like I'll come runnin' if you get 
hit. There's a war comin'. If you hadn't noticed, it's already here. So 
what I WANT is for you and yours to get real familiar with these 
'toys'," Will ground out the word with emphasis, "so you won't blow your
own balls off when I need you. I need you to be blowin' the other 
bastards' balls off when, and not if, they come back."</p>

<p>Will 
paused, then turned friendly again. "What I want in return for the 
firepower is for you to show me what a competent small unit leader I 
know you to be. Good enough?" He stuck out his hand.</p>

<p>Curtis didn't hesitate. He shook Will Shipman's hand. It was a blood oath and they both knew it.</p>

<p>"Hell,
Billy," said Shipman, "your boys are better than my boys because you've
had 'em trainin' for years when mine were just laid up and watchin' war
movies on the DVD. I'm smart enough to know that. Well, my boys are 
gettin' ready again, but your boys are ready now. Think of this as a 
return on all that sweat equity you put in."</p>

<p>Bill nodded at the 
complement, equally pleased that it had been given and also in the 
knowledge that it was indisputably true. Then a thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>"You
know," observed Bill Curtis, "this ain't the first time the Curtises 
and the Shipmans have stood shoulder to shoulder against an enemy."</p>

<p>"No,"
allowed Will, "it ain't." He paused, and then clapped the younger man 
on the shoulder and proclaimed, "The First Alabama Union Cavalry 
Regiment rides again."</p>

<p>Curtis reached out for the BAR, but 
Shipman beat him to it. "Get your own damn BAR, this one's mine. It took
me half the night to get the cosmoline off'n it. It was like petrified 
dinosaur turd after almost seventy years in that mine. Go clean your 
own."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Bill Curtis good naturedly. "C'mon, boys," he 
said to Denny and Mike, "let's get this stuff loaded and back home." The
work party set to their task with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Will Shipman just stood back and enjoyed the scene.</p>

<p>He could afford to, bein' Santa Claus and all.</p>

<h4>T.O. &amp; E.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The
key weakness of our present system is a lack of flexibility. The 
present fire team concept cannot absorb casualties and continue to 
function adequately, does not properly use the team leader as a unit 
leader, and is poorly suited to the M-16 rifle. However, it is far 
superior to previously attempted concepts and there seems to be a 
question as to whether a better system could ever be found. There is a 
better system which is easily adaptable to today's Marine Corps. It 
involves no changes in manning levels and has been combat tested. It 
involves changing the fire team from its present four-man structure to a
six-man team composed of a fire team leader, assistant fire team 
leader, and four riflemen. Let's examine the advantages using the 
triangular concept as a reference point. -- <i>James Webb, "Flexibility and the Fire Team," Marine Corps Gazette, April 1972</i></p>

<p>Tommy
Powell, Denny's oldest son, tossed and turned in a dream from which he 
could not awaken. People were trying to kill him and they shouted in 
strange languages. There was a wall. They had to make it to the wall, 
somebody yelled.</p>

<p>His dad? No. Somebody else.</p>

<p>He followed 
him as the bangs and flashes and zips seemed to come from everywhere. 
Somebody in front of him got hit. Tommy could see the blood and tissue 
blown out the back of the man's thigh. He knew that he knew him but he 
couldn't remember his name. Young like me. The rifle, someone else 
screamed, get the rifle. Tommy slung his own and picked it up. It was 
big and heavy, but somehow though he'd never seen one before, he knew 
how it worked.</p>

<p>He made it to the wall, and woke up covered with 
sweat, the shots and the shouts and the screams still echoing in his 
ears. He was in his room. It was quiet in the room, still early evening 
and he had to go to school tomorrow. Beyond the door, he could hear the 
muffled news on the television downstairs as his mom waited for his dad 
to come home. He lay back down on the sweat-soaked covers and closed his
eyes, but sleep wouldn't come for a long time.</p>

<p>"Well, if we drop
back into the old late World War II/Korean War model used by the 
Marines, then that makes it one grenadier and one BAR per fire team, 
with one rifleman designated as the assistant BAR man," said Denny 
Powell.</p>

<p>They were all in the cab of Bill Curtis' pickup, on the 
way home to examine their new toys. They were discussing how this 
embarrassment of riches would fit into their Table of Organization and 
Equipment, their T.O. &amp; E.</p>

<p>"We've already got a Designated 
Marksman per fire team," said Curtis. "We never figured on getting 
automatic weapons and the DM was supposed to sub for that. So do we give
up the DM? You can't make the Assistant BAR man do anything else but 
that, right? Are we going to have fire teams made up of all specialists 
except for the team leader? Who's going to be the rifleman/scout? The 
DM? The team leader?"</p>

<p>Denny Powell replied, "Look, I don't have 
an answer yet, I'm just thinking out loud here, so bear with me. The 
Marines summarize their fire team organization with the phrase 
"ready-team-fire-assist", since that's the arrangement of the fire team 
when its in a column. 'Ready' is the rifleman/scout. 'Team' is the team 
leader, who also works as a grenadier with an M203."</p>

<p>Mike Parker broke in, "You can't have a team leader with a bolt action rifle, it's too damn slow."</p>

<p>"Yeah,
yeah, I know," said Denny, "let me finish the thought. OK. The 
automatic rifleman, nowadays armed with an M249 SAW, also served as 
second in command of the fire team and is called "Fire." The AAR carries
his extra ammunition and is called 'Assist.' That way, when you're 
communicating in the middle of a firefight, nobody has to guess who's 
being addressed."</p>

<p>Denny paused for a moment.</p>

<p>Mike said, "Well..." but Denny cut him off.</p>

<p>"Let
me finish. So you move by rushes. If you take fire, the fire team is 
organized in such in a methodical way as to engage the enemy with fire 
team 'rushes' -- movement by one part of the team during cover by fire 
by the other part of the team. Usually, its first the Rifleman and Team 
Leader will move ahead, being covered by the Automatic and Assistant 
Automatic Riflemen, then the Automatic and Assistant Automatic Riflemen 
will move up to the Rifleman and Team Leader, being covered by the 
Rifleman and Team Leader, and so on. The process is repeated until you 
can't go any farther without serious risk to the entire fire team. Of 
course the team is also covered by other fire teams in the squad. The 
optimum ratio of support fire teams to attacking fire teams is 2 to 1. 
Somebody actually did a study on it. Some Army general, I think, I read 
an article about it once, General Dupree or something."</p>

<p>Mike Parker corrected him, "DePuy."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's it." Denny took a sip from his Diet Mountain Dew and continued.</p>

<p>"Anyway,
once you're on the objective, the fire team assumes a 'hasty 180', 
where the Automatic Rifleman covers 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock (12 o'clock 
being the most likely avenue of enemy approach), with the Rifleman and 
Assistant Automatic Rifleman covering 9 to 11 and 1 to 3 respectively. 
The Team Leader is next to the Automatic Rifleman to complement his fire
with grenade rounds and to assign targets for the M249. Once a frontal 
enemy counterattack is deemed unlikely, the fire team then will assume a
'consolidated 360' to secure the flanks."</p>

<p>Curtis cut in, "And your point is?"</p>

<p>Denny
responded with more than a little exasperation. "I told you, I don't 
have a point yet, I'm thinking out loud. But I don't see how putting a 
bolt action rifle into the mix is going to work. It's too thin. And what
if you have casualties? The whole damn thing breaks down."</p>

<p>"Well,
we don't have to use the Springfields, you know," said Bill. "We can 
shoot the grenades off an M1 or M14 type rifle, even an AR come to 
that."</p>

<p>"Where would we get the grenade blanks?" asked Denny.</p>

<p>"I
heard one of Kraut Mueller's guys had some for sale at the last AGCA 
gunshow. They're rollin' their own now. Had 'em in all calibers," 
replied Bill.</p>

<p>"Guys," interjected Mike Parker, "maybe there's another way."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Bill and Denny simultaneously.</p>

<p>Mike Parker smiled. Sometimes these guys were like an old couple that had been married since kindergarten.</p>

<p>He began to explain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most obvious advantage of a six-man fire team is its overall flexibility in every area of the triangular concept.</p>

<p>Control.
The team leader's ability to control his unit should not be affected by
the addition of two men. Col Hays established the maximum limit for 
control at seven men. The newly organized fire team would provide its 
leader with a maximum of five men, well within the seven man limit, and 
certainly more challenging than the present maximum of three. Abolishing
the automatic rifleman and the key positions he presently occupies, 
plus the addition of two more men, gives the fire team leader the 
advantage of placing himself where he can best control his unit. The 
final control consideration is the creation of an assistant team leader 
who would be ready to take charge without hesitation. He would also 
occupy key positions in tactical formations.</p>

<p>Maneuverability. A 
six-man fire team could sustain up to three casualties and still exist 
as an effective maneuver element, thus fulfilling its mission of being a
tactical and maneuver unit. The six-man team has the flexibility 
necessary for combat since formations can be changed to accommodate 
smaller numbers with no loss in efficiency.</p>

<p>Firepower. The team 
members may fire on semi-automatic or full automatic at the discretion 
of the team leader. An additional point should be made at this point 
concerning the present search for a new, heavier automatic rifle to fill
the gap left by the demise of the M-14A. While a heavier automatic 
rifle would undoubtedly provide the fire team with greater firepower, 
the sacrifice in overall flexibility negates its advantages. This is 
especially true when one considers that the M-60 machine gun is usually 
available at the platoon level, and that any contact made at ranges in 
excess of even 100 meters may be supplemented by external supporting 
arms of some sort. Therefore, the advantages gained in overall 
performance and flexibility by not implementing a different automatic 
weapon are greater than those derived from its use... The beauty of 
this entire proposed change is its flexibility, and the fact that it 
would have absolutely no ill effects on current manpower requirements 
within the Marine Corps, while increasing the overall effectiveness of 
the fire team and squad itself. Tactics of employment would not change, 
except that the fire team, perhaps for the first time, would actually 
become what it is purported to be by our instructors-a viable tactical 
and maneuver element, capable of sustaining casualties and still 
performing its assigned missions.</p>

<p>-- <i>James Webb, "Flexibility and the Fire Team," Marine Corps Gazette, April 1972</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Is
that the same Jim Webb that wrote Fields of Fire and got himself 
elected as a Democrat U.S. senator from Virginia?" asked Bill.</p>

<p>"Yup,
the very same," replied Parker. "Of course, he wrote that back in 1972,
before the Squad Automatic Weapon and he had entirely too high of a 
regard for the M16 if you ask me. I hated that jam-o-matic mouse gun in 
Iraq."</p>

<p>"So," Curtis asked, "what you're saying is that we adopt 
the six-man fire team model, keep the BAR man and his assistant, the 
grenadier, who is not the team leader, and the Designated Marksman and 
we still have a rifleman/scout?"</p>

<p>"Right," replied Carter. "We'll 
call them 'Ready-One' and 'Ready-Two,' with the DM being 'Ready-Two.' 
The grenadier would be the assistant squad leader, which would take the 
decision making load off the BAR man. Let's call him 'Grenade'. I'm with
you, though, Bill, the grenadier shouldn't have a Springfield. We 
should find a way to get him the ability to fire them off a semi-auto. 
And we ought to add one other man. A runner slash RTO to tag along with 
the squad leader. The assistant squad leader can be the best of the team
leaders. I know it's big. But you know what? The only reason the Army 
ever had smaller squads that I could figure out is that you couldn't get
a bigger squad in a helicopter or an APC. And the last time I checked, 
we didn't have any air or armor."</p>

<p>The other two men chuckled.</p>

<p>"Look,
it's a twenty man squad. But it's controllable. The squad leader, we'll
call him 'Six', still controls 3 fire team leaders plus the RTO/runner.
I dunno what we'll call him, 'Arty' maybe. The team leaders control 
five. Its doable. It maximizes our strengths, including the new weapons.
And we've got the numbers to do it. We'll be able to outrange any ATF 
or Brightfire bunch we've seen so far and we'll hit harder, even if some
of them have M203s. You know, even if we didn't have the BARs and the 
rifle grenades, this would be a better organizational model for militia.
You can still start out with buddy teams and build to this point. Webb 
may be a sell-out prick as a politician but he was right about this. And
you know what, Marine squad leaders in Iraq and Afghanistan shuffled 
their teams to make two teams of six for just those reasons."</p>

<p>"I was going to give you the next 13-man squad, you know."</p>

<p>Parker
shrugged. "So what? If it happens, it happens. Its not like it means a 
big raise in salary or something. The main thing is to put together as 
capable a squad as possible and this is the way I think we can do it. 
But I've got one other radical suggestion."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Curtis.</p>

<p>"We transition from two-man buddy teams to three-man teams."</p>

<p>Denny blurted, "What?"</p>

<p>Curtis just said, "Why?"</p>

<p>"I
know, I know, it's heresy right? We all learned on the two-man buddy 
team concept. But I've been doing a lot of reading lately on squad 
organization and I'm convinced that just like bigger fire teams, the 
larger buddy teams make sense. Hear me out."</p>

<p>He saw they would hold their objections and so he proceeded.</p>

<p>"If
a fire team is six men, then why not have two three man buddy teams? 
One is led by the team leader and the other lead by the assistant team 
leader. The three-man team, some folks call 'em 'triads', has greater 
depth that the traditional buddy team. If one man is hit, there's still 
two more to carry on with the mission, rather than having an orphan with
nobody to watch his back. The ChiComs and the NVA and VC all used 
three-man cells as the ideal building block of their ten man squads with
3 3 man cells and a squad leader. You've got a full crew for an 
automatic weapons section, like for an example a BAR man, 'Fire,' an 
AAR, 'Assist', and our Assistant Team Leader/Grenadier, 'Grenade.' 
That's one base of fire element supporting the Ready One, Ready Two and 
Team on the assault."</p>

<p>He paused and he saw they were with him so far.</p>

<p>"Now,
in addition to being more durable in case of casualties, it's a lot 
easier to spread the work of living in the field and maintaining 
yourself as a fighting team with three instead of two. We don't want to 
be caught in the position of digging fighting positions or anything 
unless we have to, but it's sure as heck easier with three instead of 
two. Plus, except during operations you've got one guy on watch, one guy
cooking, cleaning weapons or working and a third sleeping."</p>

<p>Mike paused, looked up and saw Denny nodding.</p>

<p>"Now
Denny, you're absolutely right about DePuy's work. He not only thought 
that two back, one up was a better way to assault, he PROVED it. With 
two fire teams to provide a base of fire to ensure suppression of the 
defenders and one fire team, out front attacking (which gives you fewer 
targets for the enemy), the attack would succeed nine out of ten times. 
If you reversed it and put two up in the assault and kept one back, the 
odds of success fell to 25 percent. His conclusion was that on whatever 
scale of military operations you were talking about, success went to the
smallest size of maneuver element backed up by the greatest amount of 
suppressive fire."</p>

<p>"Patton said it the same way in World War II, 
but never got around to putting it down in so many doctrinal words. 
Remember the way they used to do it with the old heavy weapons squads? 
Automatic weapons to keep their heads down to make them seek cover. 
Mortars to seek them out with indirect fire when they hid. And anti-tank
missles to destroy the bunkers or the houses when they ran from the 
mortars into overhead cover. Well, gentlemen, our fire teams will now 
have all three. BARs and Designated Marksmen for accurate suppressive 
fire. Rifle grenades to hit them with indirect and more rifle grenades 
to blow holes through walls."</p>

<p>He saw they were both nodding, working it out in their heads, imagining the new T.O. &amp; E.</p>

<p>"The
greater our suppressive fire and the faster we maneuver into the 
bastards, the more fights we'll win and the fewer casualties we'll have.
Rommel said it. Patton said it. DePuy proved it. It requires training, 
practice, and repetition, but now we've got the tools to make it all 
work."</p>

<p>Parker stopped, looking at Bill and Denny like a 
prosecuting attorney surveying a jury after an eloquent, lucid and 
forceful summation.</p>

<p>Curtis looked at Denny Powell. "What do you think?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think Mike's right. I think it'll work."</p>

<p>"OK," decided Bill Curtis, "I'm not entirely convinced about the three-man buddy team, but let's try it."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The
mission of the rifle squad is to locate, close with, and destroy the 
enemy by fire and maneuver, or repel the enemy's assault by fire and 
close combat. The rifle squad consists of three fire teams, each of 
which is built around an automatic weapon and controlled by a fire team 
leader. The squad is composed of 13 men: a sergeant (squad leader) and 
three fire teams of four men each. Each fire team normally consists of a
corporal (fire team leader/grenadier), two lance corporals (automatic 
rifleman and assistant automatic rifleman), and a private or private 
first class (rifleman)... The Squad Leader... is responsible for the
discipline, appearance, training, control, conduct, and welfare of his 
squad at all times, as well as the condition, care, and economical use 
of its weapons and equipment. In combat, he is also responsible for the 
tactical employment, fire discipline, fire control, and maneuver of his 
squad... The Squad Leader trains his squad in the performance of tasks... He maintains the condition, care, and economical use of assigned 
weapons and equipment. The Squad Leader is capable of performing all the
tasks required of a riflemen, Assistant Automatic Rifleman, Automatic 
Rifleman, and Fire Team Leader. He carries, performs operator 
maintenance for, and is a proficient marksman with (all weapons). -- <i>Marine Rifle Squad, Fleet Marine Force Manual 6-5</i></p>

<p>"All right, guys, gather round, take a seat at the tables by twos and we'll get started."</p>

<p>Mike
Parker stood at one end of a large cleared space in the back of Duff's 
Plumbing Supply. On the folding table in front of him was an M1918A2. 
They had cleaned it up, along with the other nine. There were twenty men
in the room, two per rifle. The automatic rifles lay on other folding 
tables in front of the men, two rifles and four men per table. The 
tables and chairs were borrowed from the First Baptist Church.</p>

<p>The
BARs didn't look the same as they had when they'd been first cleaned of
cosmoline. The clunky bipods had been removed and were laid out beside 
the rifles, and the original flash hiders had been replaced with Korean 
War vintage slotted flash suppressors, which were far more efficient at 
their job.</p>

<p>When Parker saw the flash suppressors, he had to know. "Where did you get these?" he had demanded of Bill Curtis that morning.</p>

<p>"Oh,
Will Shipman gave 'em to me, along with a whole bunch of other stuff. 
The day after we got the rifles, I told him our ideas for using the BARs
and the grenades, and how we needed grenade launching attachments for 
the M1As and the Garands that we already own. And I threw in about how 
some 7.62 NATO grenade blanks would be a good idea, and maybe some BAR 
spare parts kits. Three days later he shows up with a couple of stout 
cardboard boxes of stuff and yesterday the rest of it came in by UPS to 
Will's marina, and he called me to come pick it up."</p>

<p>"Where did he get it all?" asked Mike Parker. "How did he come up with it? Snap his fingers?"</p>

<p>"Well, I asked him the same thing and he told me traded Kraut Mueller for all of it."</p>

<p>"Well, Mueller's got the connections. What did he trade?"</p>

<p>"You're
goin' to love this. You remember that boxcar? Well, there were two 
crates of Liberator pistols in there, new in the cardboard boxes. TWO 
CRATES. What're they worth these days? At least a couple thousand each 
for new, unfired in the box, right? Well, it seems all he had to do was 
wave a couple of those under Kraut Mueller's nose and everything we 
needed appeared by magic."</p>

<p>Mike Parker marveled at the way the 
world sometimes worked. "Bill, it's like a famous man once told me, 
'Shit and shove me in it.'"</p>

<p>You could hear their laughter out on the road.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I
joined the 26th Division while they were right in the middle of the 
Tennessee maneuvers. I was assigned as a BAR man in the 2nd Platoon of C
Company, 101st Infantry Regiment. I liked the BAR; it gave you a lot of
firepower. My BAR was a M1918A2 with a bipod on the barrel. Although in
combat, I got rid of the bipod. I think everybody did. It would catch 
on things. I kept mine in my pack. I fired the BAR quite a bit during 
training and qualified with it. We had three=man BAR teams back then. I 
had an assistant gunner and an ammo bearer, but I always carried the 
gun. Our squad was made up of a squad leader, a first and second scout, 
the BAR man and then the ammo bearer and assistant. The rest were 
riflemen; we only had one BAR in each squad. We got over to France in 
September 1944. In combat, I wore a six pocket BAR belt that held two 
magazines in each pocket. But in one pocket, I carried a small box-like 
leather case that had all kinds of spare parts for the gun, So I only 
had ten magazines in the belt and one in the gun. The assistant gunner 
and ammo bearer carried extra magazines for the BAR, as well as ammo for
their own weapons. They both carried M1s. My ammo bearer also wore a 
full BAR belt with magazines. At one time the army had these square 
shaped canvas bags with a shoulder strap to carry BAR magazines, but I 
can't remember if either of the guys had one. Both my assistant gunner 
and ammo bearer were captured in early November. -- <i>Neal Burdette, in <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.exe/showproduct?saleitemid=544580">US Infantry Weapons in Combat: Personal Experiences from World War II and Korea</a> by Mark G. Goodwin, pp. 18-19.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But just now, Mike Parker was all business.</p>

<p>"All
right, gentlemen, this is what you came here to learn about. This is an
M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle. The BAR is an air-cooled automatic 
rifle using a gas-operated long-stroke piston rod actuated by propellant
gases bled through a vent in the barrel and locked with a tilting 
breechblock. It fires from an open bolt. The spring-powered cartridge 
casing extractor is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is 
installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker fired and the bolt 
carrier serves as the striker."</p>

<p>"Each fire team will have one BAR
assigned to it, as well as a gunner to carry it and a-gunner to feed 
it. However, you will ALL learn how to load, fire, field strip and 
maintain this piece. If everyone else in your fire team is down and out 
of the fight, I want the last guy to be shooting this."</p>

<p>Parker 
picked up the rifle and held it in front of him. "This is one heavy 
mother of an automatic rifle. But it is what we have. All of the rifles 
in front of you came from the factory with Bakelite stocks which makes 
them lighter, not that you'll notice after you hump them for a while. 
Unloaded, the rifle weighs about twenty pounds. With a web belt full of 
twenty-round magazines, you'll be humping more than twice that. Each 
loaded magazine weighs one pound, seven ounces. That's why we assign you
an assistant automatic rifleman to tote extra magazines, refill your 
empties and, if need be, to wipe your troubled brow."</p>

<p>The men chuckled softly, but no more than that.</p>

<p>"What
they will NOT do for you is tote your rifle, no matter how heavy it 
gets. If you are assigned the BAR based on your aptitude, YOU will carry
it, and not your 'Assist.' In the process you will rediscover your 
biceps and find other muscles you never thought you had. This is normal.
Now, we have also helped you by stripping off the bipods they came 
with. Some BAR men swore by them, but most said they weren't worth the 
weight, that they got caught in vegetation. We also removed the carrying
handles. Together, this will save you about three pounds. Also, because
we want to make you harder for the enemy to spot on the battlefield, we
have removed the old World War II flash hiders they came with and 
installed Korean War vintage sure-'nuff flash suppressors. This not only
makes it harder for you to be spotted, but preserves your all-important
night vision."</p>

<p>Parker glanced around the room.</p>

<p>"OK, now 
the M1918A2 is an automatic rifle which uses a change lever fire control
mechanism on the trigger housing that permits fully automatic fire only
at two rates of fire. I repeat, there is no semi-auto setting for this 
rifle. There is a fast rate, the 'A' position on the selector. This puts
out about 550 rounds per minute. There is also a slow rate, the 'F' 
position on the selector which puts out 350 rounds per minute. The slow 
rate of fire is achieved by engaging a buffer device installed inside 
the buttstock. However, the maximum EFFECTIVE rate of fire is about 
120-150 rounds per minute, fired in short bursts of from three to five 
shots. This means you'll be pulling the trigger and immediately 
releasing it. With practice, you'll get used to it and you will be in 
full control of the rifle, not the other way around."</p>

<p>"The 'S' 
position," and here Parker showed the men how he was manipulating the 
selector lever on the left side of the trigger group, "is 'Safe.' This 
weapon has fully adjustable iron sights, with a post foresight and a 
leaf rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation) which is 
graduated from 100 to 1,600 yd with a combat zero notch for immediate 
firing up to 300 yd."</p>

<p>Parker took in the room again. They were all furiously scribbling notes.</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<p>"Now
remember, this is NOT a light machine gun, people, it is an automatic 
rifle. You will NOT spray and pray with this. If you fire too fast and 
exhaust magazine after magazine as fast as you can, you will burn the 
barrel out and then you won't be able to hit the broad side of a barn 
with it. You WILL use aimed fire in short bursts, I don't care if you're
fighting the People's Liberation Army of China in an alley. This weapon
fires faster, is psychologically more intimidating to the enemy and 
punches harder than any other rifle we have. With AP you can penetrate 
any body armor with plates that you are likely to encounter. This weapon
is our ace in the hole. SO YOU WILL NOT PUT YOUR OWN RIFLE OUT OF 
ACTION BY YOUR OWN STUPIDITY. UNDERSTOOD?"</p>

<p>They all sang out, "Yes, Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"There
may be times when we may need you to use the bipod, for ambushes, 
defensive positions or long-range shooting, so the Assist will be 
carrying it in his pack. When you do, you will also use this fold-out 
shoulder rest in the butt of the rifle. We will teach you how."</p>

<p>Parker flipped the shoulder rest out, then back in.</p>

<p>"OK,
for some of the problems with the weapon that you will encounter if you
do not perform maintenance the way we teach you. The rate reducer 
mechanism is difficult to clean and is susceptible to damage from 
moisture and corrosion. This renders the weapon inoperable or prevents 
it from firing in automatic mode. Even BARs that were used in the dry 
deserts of North Africa had this problem and I'll tell you why. If you 
rest the butt of this weapon on the ground to clean it vertically, 
instead of laying it flat on a surface, cleaning fluid and burned powder
collect in the buffer mechanism. In addition, you will be issued 
corrosive ammunition for this rifle. Why? Because that's what we have. 
So you will need to be scrupulous about cleaning it, especially the gas 
cylinder. And I mean on a daily basis, gentlemen. However, if you take 
care of Miss Browning, she will take care of you. She is rugged and 
reliable as long as she's regularly field-stripped and cleaned."</p>

<p>There wasn't a ripple of amusement. Good, thought Parker.</p>

<p>"OK,
because this is a weapon that fires from an open bolt, you will NOT 
carry the BAR with an open bolt on 'Safe' unless in the presence of the 
enemy. This means that at all other times you will carry the weapon with
the bolt down on an empty chamber and then, and only then, will you 
place a magazine in the rifle. Whether in the presence of the enemy or 
not, loaded rifles are ALWAYS carried with muzzles elevated or pointed 
to the front. ALWAYS."</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/bar-mag-belt.jpg" alt='BAR Mag Belt' width='400' height='139'/></p>

<p>"Now,
you will notice that each automatic rifleman will be issued an M1937 
BAR Magazine Belt. These belts and the empty magazines issued with them 
are on each end of your table. Study them. You will notice when you do 
that the original lift-a-dot and stud fasteners have been removed and 
replaced with velcro. This was done by our ladies' auxiliary at our 
commander's request because the original set-up was known to deeply dent
the magazines if the auto rifleman hit the dirt hard enough. The blow 
would center on the post, driving it into the mag and the resulting dent
would stop the magazine follower from freely traveling, causing a 
failure to feed. I know that the velcro is noisier than the snaps. All 
that means is that you take the flap off your first pocket and tuck it 
down behind the magazines before you settle in to an ambush position. 
After the ball is opened, believe me, nobody's going to hear the 
velcro."</p>

<p>"One last comment on magazines. They require at least as
much maintenance as the rifle itself. They must be frequently 
disassembled, cleaned, wiped dry, and thinly coated with oil. As much as
possible, keep them free from dirt and rust. If not the spring and 
follower will stick. Your life and all of our lives may depend upon it. 
And you'd better not sluff that duty off on your Assist. I don't mind if
he helps. I don't mind if you're a finicky SOB who insists on cleaning 
his own mags. Good on you. But if I catch you dumpin' the job on your 
AAR, I'll feed you those mags rectally, without lubricant."</p>

<p>He glared at the crowd. Nobody breathed. They believed him.</p>

<p>"All right. Here's how you field strip the M1918A2 BAR..."</p>

<p>Tommy Powell was mesmerized. This was the rifle from his dream. The one somebody had dropped and that he'd picked up.</p>

<p>He'd
had the dream twice more since the first night. It started at the same 
place, but the second and third time it ended a little further on. He 
was at the wall. He ejected the empty magazine of the rifle and slapped 
in a new one, and he pointed it at the screaming men trying to kill him 
and began to fire rolling bursts at the windows. There was a farmhouse 
and there were windows. Someone was screaming about grenades and he woke
up.</p>

<p>It troubled him some, especially now that he understood that
it wasn't a dream, or even a nightmare, but a vision. His grandmother 
had the sight. His momma had it too, although not as specific as his 
grandma.</p>

<p>It was the Cherokee blood in them that gave them the 
vision power. Tommy knew he had it. He'd once seen his grandmother and 
grandfather when they were young down sitting under the Natural Bridge. 
There was an old-timey car and a picnic. His grandfather took out some 
chewing tobacco from his bib overalls and bit off a chew. Then he looked
up at Tommy and smiled. That was it. He woke up.</p>

<p>It had been 
broad daylight and he was sitting under the Natural Bridge and it was a 
waking dream. A vision, said his grandmother after he'd told her about 
in embarrassment, not a dream but a vision. There were places, she 
explained, where the visions came more readily than others. His momma, 
who had more education than his daddy, explained it like this.</p>

<p>"Tommy,
there's places in our world where time and space intersect. Where you 
can stand today and feel yesterday looking over your shoulder, hear it 
whispering in your ears, and see it playing out in front of your eyes. 
Natural Bridge is place like that. I met a man once who said he had an 
experience like that up at Stone's River in Tennessee on a battlefield 
where his great granddaddy fought. Your grandfather died a long time 
before you were born. I reckon it was just his way of saying hello 
across the years. Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to tell anybody 
else who hasn't got the sight about it, they won't understand. Just 
appreciate it for the gift it is. Someday it might warn you of danger 
so's you can get out of the way."</p>

<p>Since then, he'd had other 
visions. His grandma came to him the night she died in Birmingham, him 
sleeping in his bed in Winston County, and told him not to fret, that 
everything was all right. He woke up the next morning, and his momma and
daddy had come in all puffy-eyed and cried out from the ride home and 
told him she had passed. He told them about how grandma had said it was 
all right, and he wasn't upset, not a bit, though he'd been close to 
her. There were other times, visions he couldn't explain. An eagle and 
an Alabama black panther, fighting, but friendly-like, as if neither 
wanted to kill the other. A Cherokee warrior who turned and spoke to him
in ancient words he understood, though afterwards he couldn't remember 
them. And now this. It was a warning, Tommy had no doubt. Maybe he would
have the dream enough times where he could see the end and know what to
do when the time came.</p>

<p>He would wait.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After
they were captured, I was short on ammo. Another guy in the squad 
filled in for them after that. I had a metal loader that fit over the 
top of the magazines and he would get stripper clip ammo, the five round
clips for the Springfield, and he'd run those stripper clips down into 
the magazines. He was pretty good, he always came up with ammo and 
grenades and kept us well-supplied. If we didn't get issued the 
five-round stripper clips, we'd have to get our ammo from eight-round M1
clips. We got a mix of ball and armor piercing ammunition, but no 
tracers. I didn't want any tracers... The BAR was very accurate, if 
you had open terrain you could shoot out to 600 yards. I felt like I 
could stitch someone at that range. With trigger control, I could shoot 
one round at a time or two rounds or as many as I wanted. I never had 
any problems at all with mine; it was a dependable weapon. You had to 
keep it pretty clean, but I didn't think it was hard to maintain. I kept
a can of bore cleaner and a little can of oil in the belt pocket with 
the leather case. I would have to borrow a cleaning rod to clean the 
bore. -- <i>Neal Burdette, in US Infantry Weapons in Combat: Personal Experiences from World War II and Korea by Mark G. Goodwin, pp. 19.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It
took them a while to train up the BAR men and the grenadiers and to 
work the kinks out of the new structure. On weekends, the Bankhead once 
again rang with automatic weapons fire and the crump of explosions, but 
nobody complained or called the Sheriff's office. Hearing the echoes, 
they would just say to one another, "That's our boys up there again, 
hard at it." If anybody replied it would be something like, "I hope they
save enough ammo for those damn Brightfire fiends."</p>

<p>Trying to 
control 19 men seemed tough at first to Bill, but mostly it was just a 
matter getting used to the fact that the new squad front was so much 
bigger than the old and not to jam in on each other. Using the two back,
one up system also took some practice, and the three man buddy teams 
caused some friction with men who had been split up and didn't like it. 
Finally, some of them came to Bill and told him it just didn't feel 
right. Even Parker had to admit that the sociology of three men as 
buddies didn't always work out. Some men played dominance games and 
others just had a buddy they wouldn't part with and treated the third 
man like a go-fer, not a partner. Parker argued that is was just a 
matter of leadership by the squad and fire team leaders to make sure the
third man wasn't dumped on, but it still caused problems.</p>

<p>Finally,
being militia, they decided to compromise. There would be fire teams 
made up of two-man buddy teams and others made up of three-man teams. 
The troops griped about that too because it meant shuffling the fire 
teams once more, but they had to admit it was better than the 
alternative.</p>

<p>But even with the unsettling changes, the men could 
sense the new power they had, and they responded well, coming up with 
new suggestions. They had used whistles for command and control before, 
but it was young Phillip Curtis who suggested to his father that each 
team leader and the squad leader should use one of a different type or 
pitch so as eliminate confusion. They worked with small squad radios for
the leaders and with 26.5mm flare pistol signals -- smoke for day, star
clusters by night -- and gradually got used to firing and maneuvering 
without tripping over each other.</p>

<p>Having such capable fire teams 
allowed them to be split off for special missions in the middle of an 
FTX without worrying about their lacking the combat power to accomplish 
it. The other thing they all noticed was how having bigger fire teams 
enabled the fire team leader to take advantage of tactical opportunities
without waiting for help or instructions from the squad leader. The 
squad was not only more powerful, but it became more nimble, even with 
its added bulk.</p>

<p>When they went up against Will Shipman's much 
larger unit with blanks and umpires as OPFOR in the biggest militia 
tactical FTX any of them had ever heard of, they cleaned Shipman's 
clock.</p>

<p>It wasn't even close.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The
one big attack we made while I was there, we ran the Krauts off of Hill
310 in France. We all lined up around the back of an old church with 
all our automatic weapons. We started firing to keep the Krauts pinned 
down. There was also artillery and mortar fire hitting the hill too. 
While we fired, another platoon walked down this little valley and then 
went up the hill. We kept firing until they got on top of the hill and 
we were afraid we were going to hit them. Then we quit firing and took 
off right after them. I fired about six or eight magazines during the 
attack. My assistant was lying right there beside me and when I'd drop 
an empty magazine from my gun, he would reload it. He was reloading them
as fast as I was firing them. He was a cool and calm guy under fire. 
The Krauts were still popping up out of the holes when we overran them. 
It was like a Fort Benning field problem and it worked just the way it 
was supposed to work. We just kept up a steady fire and the other 
platoon did marching fire going up the hill and the Krauts were pinned 
down in their holes. I remember when I ran up there, I ran past a Kraut 
machine gun with a big frame mount and a scoped sight. The crew had been
captured, we'd kept them so pinned down they couldn't do anything. I 
came to another hole and these guys popped up and then dropped back 
down. I wasn't going to run past them and leave them behind me, so I 
stuck the BAR down the hole and fired about five rounds. I'm not sure if
I hit them or not, but I went on. We didn't have a single casualty in 
the whole attack. -- <i>Neal Burdette, in US Infantry Weapons in 
Combat: Personal Experiences from World War II and Korea by Mark G. 
Goodwin, pp. 19-20.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bill Curtis, Denny Powell and Mike 
Parker sat outside the CP tent, pleasantly exhausted, staring into the 
campfire. Most of their boys, and Shipman and all his troops, had gone 
home. They had finished their own after action analysis. Their new 
system had worked.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mike, "I guess the payoff will come when we face somebody for the first time for real."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Denny, "but who and when?" Powell and Parker looked at Curtis.</p>

<p>"I
don't know," their leader replied, "But we're a hell of a lot more 
ready than we were a few months ago, whoever it is and whenever it 
happens."</p>

<p>Mike Parker raised his folding aluminum canteen cup with instant coffee in the air, "Here's to the Deacon and his boxcar."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Bill Curtis and Denny Powell as one, raising their own coffees.</p>

<p>Parker laughed.</p>

<p>Just like an old married couple, he thought.</p>

<p>Tommy Powell had another vision that night.</p>

<p>This time, it went all the way to the end. He saw what was going to happen and what he had to do.</p>

<p>Funny
thing, his grandfather was standing right beside him at the end of the 
vision, pointing out the danger and what he must do. He did it, and his 
grandfather smiled.</p>

<p>Then he woke up.</p>

<p>This time, he wasn't sweating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://doyourownpestcontrol.com/blow-fly.htm">Blow Fly</a>:
 any of a large family of flies known for the habit of the larvae, or 
immature flies of, infesting animal carcasses. They are found worldwide,
 occurring nearly every place inhabited by people. Blow flies are 
slightly larger than true house flies, and the bodies of many are 
metallic blue or green in color. Worldwide, there are about 1200 species
 of blow flies, and in North America there are 80... they have robust 
bodies and wide heads. The name blow fly comes from the bloated 
condition of the rotting animal carcasses that their larvae, known as 
maggots, infest. The most frequent species found under these conditions 
is the common blow fly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Unfinished Business: "Blowfly"</h4>

<p>They
may have been chased unceremoniously out of the state of Alabama, but 
ATF had not given up on finding their ten missing agents. Nor had they 
given up on finding Charlie Quintard. Barton Meigs' replacement as 
regional director of the ATF was everything AD Atherton could have 
wanted. This was probably because Atherton himself had hand-picked her.</p>

<p>Dody
Saako was just perfect for the job. She evinced a certain 
predisposition to the slavish obedience of orders, combined it with a 
vicious disdain for the legal niceties in carrying them out and 
possessed on top of it all an insatiable appetite for advancement. For 
Atherton's purposes, Dody Saako was just what the tyrant ordered.</p>

<p>Her
rise in the agency had been nothing short of meteoric. Other agents, 
perhaps jealous or perhaps simply having more scruples, said she had 
fellated her way to the top. She had acquired several nicknames in her 
short career. "Blowfly" was one, for obvious reasons. "Floater" was 
another, as in "shit floats to the top of any body of water." However 
she had managed it before this, it was assumed that she got this 
position without her feminine wiles. Atherton was well-known as the 
raving queen of the DC ATF hierarchy and his appetites did not extend to
the females of the species, even predatory pseudo-masculine types such 
as Saako.</p>

<p>For its part, Brightfire felt it had some unfinished 
business too. After the Winston County Massacre, the Winston County 
Sheriff's Department had found and secured the tracker team's vehicle 
when they moved to investigate the still smoking Miller Mine. The 
vehicle surrendered no clues as to the whereabouts of the missing team. A
week later, ABI had sent a state fire-rescue team into the bowels of 
that smoldering Hell and retrieved three, well, if not bodies in the 
strictest sense, then human remains.</p>

<p>Three, not four.</p>

<p>Thus was one more mystery laid at the door of Charlie Quintard.</p>

<p>John
Claxton of Brightfire intended to solve that mystery first. Which was 
why Jaime Sepulveda had parked his battered pickup loaded with old 
lawnmowers at the entrance to Miller Mine. It was good cover. A lot of 
Mexican illegals had gone home after the recession (some said 
depression) in El Norte claimed their jobs. But there were still bunches
of them scraping by in north Alabama. They did their very best to avoid
being pulled into either side of the current Tenth Amendment argument, 
so neither side paid them much attention. Thus no one had blinked an eye
at Jaime as he drove his pickup with valid Winston County tags past the
eagle-eyed state troopers who were still roaming about in search of 
feds and mercenaries to disarm and escort beyond the state line.</p>

<p>Jaime
was a trained crime scene investigator. The company had made use of him
many times all over the world, usually to cast doubt on other CSI's 
work at the scenes of Brightfire "excesses," enabling company 
contractors to avoid prosecution or conviction in local courts. Now 
Miller Mine was his crime scene. He had no interest in going into the 
mine. He was searching the immediate area outside the mine entrance for 
clues to what might have happened to one Patrick Docker, late of South 
Armagh, Northern Ireland. It was, he thought, looking at the mucked up 
ground left by the state and county authorities, a fool's errand.</p>

<p>An
hour later, he was convinced of it. There was nothing here. Nothing 
that told him anything at any rate. He looked up at the stone archway. 
"1918." Well, that was the last place to look, he thought. Might as well
convince them back in Virginia that I'm thorough. He scrambled up the 
blackened hillside, making for the top of the arch. The vegetation had 
all burned away, and rains had deposited more silt and pebbles downhill,
mixed with streaks of charcoal and soot. There was an eroded channel 
behind the top of the archway, big enough for a man to hide in, but 
nothing more. He turned to make his way down the hillside when the sun 
came out from behind a cloud and glinted off something yellow at the 
other end of the channel. He carefully made his way over and saw 
immediately that it was a piece of brass. .45 ACP. Hmmm. He pulled an 
evidence baggie out of his pocket and used a pen to flick the brass into
the bag.</p>

<p>Jaime Selpuveda searched some more, but found nothing 
else. "Now what," he addressed the piece of bagged brass, "are you doing
up here?" There were a thousand possible explanations. He wondered 
about the most likely of them all the way back to the ATF lab in 
Nashville.</p>

<p>"So," said "Blowfly" Saako, "what have you found?"</p>

<p>There
were four people in the conference room. Saako, John Claxton, Jaime 
Sepulveda, and the ATF evidence technician Dennis Warren.</p>

<p>"Ma'am,"
began Warren, "Mr. Selpuveda found this .45 caliber shell casing at the
Miller Mine site. It matches with several others found five years ago 
at a drug hit in Walker County, Alabama. A DEA informant was killed."</p>

<p>"Walker County? Not Winston?" Saako asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Ma'am, Walker County is southeast of Winston and they share a common border."</p>

<p>"I see, go ahead."</p>

<p>"The
bullets in that case were recovered as well, and matching the markings 
on both bullets and casings, the evidentiary conclusion at that time -- 
which I agree with having gone over it in detail -- "</p>

<p>Saako cut him off. "Get to the damn point."</p>

<p>"Yes,
ma'am." The technician was nervous. He didn't like mercenaries and he 
didn't like Saako although he'd known her all of four and a half 
minutes. "As I was saying, they match to the same MAC-10 machine pistol 
fired with a sound suppressor. The suppressor is ever so slightly off 
center and the markings on the bullets recovered from Walker County 
indicate slight nicks where they hit the metal at the end of the tube on
the way out. It can't be very accurate at distance. The estimated range
in the Walker County hit was just 4 feet or so. I..."</p>

<p>"All right, do you have anything else?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am, I..."</p>

<p>Saako turned to Sepulveda. "Does he?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Jaime Sepulveda shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>John Claxton answered for his CSI. "Yes, we do."</p>

<p>Saako turned back to the ATF tech. "All right, you can go. Leave the evidence."</p>

<p>The
tech sagged with relief, grabbed the table top and pushed himself up as
if struggling with gravity. He left as quickly as possible. Selpuveda 
raised an eyebrow at Claxton and he nodded in return. The Brightfire CSI
stood and left the room as well.</p>

<p>Saako turned to Claxton. "What do you have?" she said preemptorily.</p>

<p>"We
have ah, sources, within the DEA. At the time of the killing of their 
snitch, they had a very good suspect for this murder. Unfortunately, he 
disappeared shortly afterward."</p>

<p>"Disappeared?"</p>

<p>"Yes, along with between five and seven of his confederates. The DEA says they just vanished."</p>

<p>"Vanished, huh?" said Saako. "There's a lot of that going around in that f-cking state." She paused. "And you conclude what?"</p>

<p>"It
seems reasonable to me that whoever your agents ran into is probably 
the same man that these missing druggies encountered. And whoever that 
is, that person acquired the MAC-10 from the druggies. DEA says their 
suspect was running meth labs in several counties at the time, including
Winston. Finally, there is one other thing. There was a report that 
some years ago Phil Gordon had trouble with somebody cooking meth in his
empty cabin just before he rented it to Charlie Quintard. He was 
overheard saying that was the reason he rented it to Quintard, to keep 
the druggies from coming back."</p>

<p>"So you think that Quintard killed the druggies and then used the MAC-10 on my agents and your contractors?"</p>

<p>"It
is not a tremendous leap of logic. My team was tasked to track down and
find Charlie Quintard. When the blimp came down, they refused to leave 
what they were doing and chase the blimp bombers. I can only conclude 
that they had something more important going on at the time than that. 
The ONLY thing more important than that was Quintard. Remember, I lost 
three of my men to the explosion in that mine. Their remains were 
recovered. One is unaccounted for. The team would not have gone into the
mine without leaving a security man outside. And Jaime recovered just 
one piece of brass from the mine entrance. One man, one shot, close 
range. It fits."</p>

<p>"And Quintard moved the body? Where?"</p>

<p>"I 
don't know, and we probably will never know. Quintard may have moved it,
maybe he had friends do it for him. It seems unlikely that one burnt 
out computer geek can turn into the Terminator. I'd say he probably had 
help, maybe even with the killings."</p>

<p>"So who are his friends?" asked Saako.</p>

<p>"From
some random communications intercepts and other evidence, we believe 
this man holds the key to Quintard's whereabouts," Claxton said as he 
passed a photograph over to Saako.</p>

<p>"What 'other evidence'?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not say at the moment," Claxton replied. "I think, if I were to tell you, you would rather not know either."</p>

<p>"Huh," said Saako. She flipped it over and read the man's name off the back of the 8x10.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she replied, "this guy is in our files too. Militia leader down there, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Claxton.</p>

<p>"I've
been told to stay out of Alabama for right now. That comes from the 
White House, they tell me. They also tell me that you've received the 
same orders because the people around the President don't want any more 
Alabama law enforcement officers killed. For the time being, anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Claxton mildly, "I've heard that too."</p>

<p>"So what do you propose that we do?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Claxton airily, "Why don't you let me take care of that?"</p>

<p>Dody Saako wasn't having any of it.</p>

<p>"No. I want to know what you propose that we do."</p>

<p>"I
don't propose that WE do anything. Orders are orders. But it seems to 
me that if someone could get a hold of the man here," he tapped the 
photo on the table top, "and dynamically interrogate him, that might 
lead someone to Charlie Quintard. We may not have enough evidence to 
indict either of them. However, if someone else takes them out of the 
picture in, shall we say, a private quarrel, then no blame can attach to
us and we will still have made the point that no one messes with an ATF
agent, or a Brightfire contractor, and lives. That is a worthy goal, 
don't you think?"</p>

<p>Saako looked at him narrowly and with considerable growing respect. This guy is as ruthless as I am, she thought, maybe more so.</p>

<p>Claxton took her silence as skepticism. "Look, were you at Waco?"</p>

<p>"No," said "Blowfly," wishing that she had been.</p>

<p>"Well,
I was. I was a... military consultant at the time, working for the 
government. Do you know what happened after the compound was fully 
engulfed in flames?"</p>

<p>"Well, I... "</p>

<p>Claxton cut her off. 
"The FBI went in and took down the Davidian flag from their flagpole and
ran up one of their own, just like Iwo Jima -- while the place was 
still on fire with people burning up in there. Do you know what was on 
that flag?"</p>

<p>Saako didn't have a clue.</p>

<p>"'ATF' in big bold 
letters. And surrounding that, four stars, one for each of the ATF men 
killed in the initial raid. You know what the 19th of April is to the 
ATF, surely?"</p>

<p>Of course she did. "It's Elliott Ness' birthday."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Elliott Ness, the patron saint of your agency. Four stars. On his birthday. Surely it's obvious?"</p>

<p>Saako sat silently.</p>

<p>"The
FBI gave your agency a gift on your sacred day. By doing so they wanted
to send a message to everybody. 'You don't kill federal agents without 
consequence, and we'll get twenty of you for every one of ours. We'll 
burn down your church and kill every living soul in it, even your 
babies, to prove our sincerity.'"</p>

<p>Claxton pressed his point. "We 
are coming into a period of our country's history where there will be 
many bodies on the ground. In fact, there already are. Surely no one 
will pay much notice to two more?"</p>

<p>He paused. "Don't you agree?"</p>

<p>Saako felt the mercenary's eyes boring into her. If this was a test, she was going to pass it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>Claxton smiled. "Good. Now, as I said, let me take care of this. We WILL make our point."</p>

<h4>Industrial Mechanix</h4>

<p>Jack Durer's man in Nashville replayed the disc once more, just to make sure he had it right.</p>

<p>"Holy shit," he said again, at the end of it. "Holy shit."</p>

<p>The
name on the outer office door said "Industrial Mechanix." It had been a
real company until the owner of the head office in Mobile had run afoul
of Alabama law. Now it was a front for Jack Durer's intelligence 
gathering efforts in Nashville. The office had the advantage of being 
right across the street from ATF regional headquarters.</p>

<p>Dan Brown called out to his assistant, who was making a new pot of coffee.</p>

<p>"Marty, forget that and get in here."</p>

<p>Marty
Abraham heard the urgency in his boss' voice and was there in an 
instant. "Your man Warren did us proud. You've already made copies of 
this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"No sleep tonight, Marty. You can get 
coffee on the road. We can't even trust encrypted email or fax 
transcript on this. It has to be heard to be appreciated. Take a copy of
this to Durer and put it in his hands as soon as possible." His 
subordinate already looked beat. It had been a long day. "Are you sure 
you're good to go on this?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, boss, no problem."</p>

<p>"OK, is Thompson still sleeping in the back room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How long's he been there?"</p>

<p>"Just three hours. He really needs some more sack time."</p>

<p>"All
right. Take this to Jack, put it into his hands only, answer any 
questions he has and then find a motel and get some sleep. After you're 
rested make your way back here as soon as you can. I'll try to get you a
couple days off to see your wife and kids in two or three days. Right 
now, I need you back here as soon as possible. And tell 'Old Dog' Durer 
that we're gonna need some more boots on the ground up here. This shit 
is going to break wide open and right now I'm not sure which way the 
enemy is going to jump. Hell, he may already be jumping for all I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, son, git. And drive safely. Getting there is more important than speed, and speed is important."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>When he looked up, Marty was gone. Dan Brown looked at his copy of the disc one more time.</p>

<p>"Holy shit," he murmured.</p>

<p>Thompson wasn't going to get much sleep tonight. And neither was Dan Brown.</p>

<h4>Morning, two days later, Franklin, Tennessee.<br/>
"Gonzo Greene and Rizzo the Rat"</h4>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/gonzo.jpg" alt="Gonzo" width='254' height='294'/></p>

<p>Gonzo
Greene was too ugly for his own good. For a man who was in the business
of what some called "black ops" and others called "wet work" and who 
depended upon being one of the forgettable faces in the crowd, Gonzo was
just too ugly to be ignored.</p>

<p>This fact had almost cost him his life a half dozen times already.</p>

<p>They
called him Gonzo because he had big bug eyes and a long, hooked nose 
just like the Jim Henson Muppet. The first time somebody called him 
that, he had to go find a VHS tape of the Muppets and watch it. 
Afterward, he went back, found the guy who called him Gonzo and broke 
both his legs with a baseball bat. Gonzo Greene had anger management 
issues in addition to being butt ugly. This also should have 
disqualified him from black ops. He was able to overcome these two 
deficiencies by being very good at killing people. He really liked 
killing people, and so he was good at it. He even came in time to 
identify with his Muppet namesake.</p>

<p>In the Muppet universe, nobody
knew what Gonzo was. In 'The Great Muppet Caper', Gonzo had been 
shipped in a crate marked "Whatever." In 'Muppets From Space', it was 
said that Gonzo was an alien from outer space. Some thought he was a 
buzzard.</p>

<p>But Gonzo Greene didn't believe any of that. He thought 
that "The Great Gonzo" was a chicken hawk. After all, he was always 
romantically pursuing Camilla the chicken, wasn't he? Didn't he know 
more than anybody about chickens? He had to be a chicken hawk. Who else 
would know more about his prey than a predator? When Gonzo proclaimed 
his undying friendship for chickens, Gonzo Greene saw right through it. 
He'd said the same thing many times just before he put a bullet in 
somebody.</p>

<p>Gonzo the Muppet also didn't care what anybody thought 
of him. Gonzo Greene loved that. Even when John Cleese had called him an
"ugly, disgusting little blue creature who catches cannonballs", the 
Muppet Gonzo didn't care.</p>

<p>What strength of character.</p>

<p>Of 
course, when Gonzo Greene first saw that episode he wanted to kill John 
Cleese for insulting his idol. It was a damn good thing his travels had 
never taken him to Great Britain, or the world would be short one more 
Python..</p>

<p>Like Gonzo Greene, the Muppet was always doing death 
defying acts and, also like Greene, he never gave a damn if they worked 
or not. The death defying was the important thing. The rush. Skating 
across thin ice with a wolf pack at your back. Greene lived for the 
adrenaline as much as the kill. It was almost sexual for him. One of 
Greene's favorite episodes was when Kermit decided to cancel a jousting 
match and Gonzo, in armor for the sketch, forced Kermit at the point of 
his lance to reverse the decision. Another character asks Gonzo, "Do you
really think this will work?" And Gonzo replies happily, "No! Isn't it 
great?!"</p>

<p>Sadly, unlike Gonzo the Muppet, Gonzo Greene didn't have
many friends. In fact, he only had one. That was Richard Andrietti, a 
young twenty-something ex-mobster from Jersey City who had switched 
sides in a deal where Gonzo Greene had been asked to straighten out a 
disagreement between the Brightfire Corporation and the head of a 
dockworkers union local. At issue was how much Brightfire property it 
was permissable to steal in the process of being sent to Iraq. The local
union president said more, Brightfire said less and the union leader 
lost the argument.</p>

<p>The bright side of the deal was that Gonzo 
Greene found a friend. Of course because he was tall, thin and had 
slightly buck teeth, Andrietti was dubbed "Rizzo the Rat."</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/rizzo.jpg" alt='Rizzo' width='170' height='226'/></p>

<p>Rizzo,
unlike Gonzo Greene, didn't like to kill people. He was however a 
torturer of not inconsiderable skill, as he had proven on more than one 
occasion.</p>

<p>It wasn't that Rizzo minded people dying so much, except that when they were dead, they quit screaming.</p>

<p>And Rizzo really liked the screaming part.</p>

<p>At
the moment, Gonzo Greene and Rizzo the Rat Andrietti sat across a hotel
room from John Claxton. They had in their time as freelancers for 
Brightfire worked at Claxton's behest six times. They had been well paid
on every occasion.</p>

<p>John Claxton looked at the two hired guns and
sighed. Why do I feel like Kermit the Frog? Well, hell, he thought, 
they are just tools, and not very sharp ones either. He would use them 
this one last time and retire them. In the world of black ops, that 
meant you didn't get to draw your pension.</p>

<p>He did not bother to tell Gonzo and Rizzo that. He did brief them on their mission.</p>

<p>As usual, they were full of questions, most of them just this side of stupid. Finally, he tired of it.</p>

<p>"Look,
the target will be uncovered as best I can manage it. Given the size of
the diversion force and how much it is costing me you schmucks just 
better not screw up your end of the deal. You'll only have the one 
chance. Get the package to the rendezvous across the Tennessee line and 
take your time getting the information. You'll only have one chance at 
that too. However, he is not to be killed until my guys go in and act 
upon his information. We want both of them, and you won't get your bonus
unless we do. You got that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Gonzo crossly, "we got it."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Across
the street, Dan Brown and Marty Abraham waited to hear from Thompson 
and Diehl. Abraham pressed his ear bud tighter to his head. "Did they 
get anything?" asked Brown.</p>

<p>"No, the laser won't pick up through the thick curtains."</p>

<p>"Do we have any idea who he's meeting?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"All
right. If Claxton comes out alone, put Team Three on the alternating 
tail on him. You, me and Teams Two and Four will stick like glue to 
whoever's in there."</p>

<p>"We'd better move, sir, we've been sitting here too long."</p>

<p>"Right, go. Tell Two to maintain position."</p>

<p>Abraham began to mutter into his mic.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Claxton emerged, looked around the lot and, apparently satisfied, drove off back toward Nashville on I-65.</p>

<p>Thirty
three minutes after that, Gonzo and Rizzo came out, threw their luggage
in the trunk of their rental car and walked over to the Shoney's across
the street to eat lunch. As the car was in full view of the restaurant,
they could do nothing but wait.</p>

<p>Abraham said it first, "Those 
are two of the ugliest mothers I've ever seen in my life. They look like
Abbott and Costello crossed with Freddy Krueger."</p>

<p>Abraham sat up
straight. "Sir, Diehl went in to get a take out order and he's got eyes
on them. They both just went into the john."</p>

<p>Yeah, but what if there was a third guy still in the room? "Hell, let's risk it. Tag it."</p>

<p>"Four, tag it, repeat, tag it now," ordered Abraham over the radio.</p>

<p>His
boys were slick, Brown had to admit. One guy, looking like a generic 
maintenance man, slid out of nowhere that Dan could see and went under 
the front of the rental car. Just that fast he was up, and gone. He 
might have stopped to bend down and tie his bootlace.</p>

<p>"Diehl says they're coming out of the john."</p>

<p>"Did Thompson. ."</p>

<p>Abraham
anticipated the question. "Yes, sir, he swung around back to make sure 
they didn't book out that way. As soon as Diehl gets his order, he's 
going to walk around and join him. We'll have eyes on the front, and 
they'll have the back."</p>

<p>"Good," said Brown.</p>

<p>He knew he shouldn't be a mother hen. These men knew their jobs. They were all Jack Durer's best. As was he.</p>

<p>Abraham
listened to his ear bud again. "Sir, Teams Five and Six are getting off
at the Cool Springs exit right now. They're going to refuel and join us
shortly."</p>

<p>So, Jack had made good on his promise for more boots on the ground. "How many cars?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Team Five has three, Team Six has two. Once they top their tanks they'll be good for a couple of days of alternating."</p>

<p>"All right. As soon as they take up station here, we'll go back to Nashville and I'll cut you loose to go home for a few days."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, sir. My wife went to live with her mother for a while."</p>

<p>Shit. "Anything I can do?"</p>

<p>Marty
Abraham was silent for a moment. "No sir, we'll patch it up later. I 
think, that is, I hope, Sarah's just trying to make a point."</p>

<p>"How about if I have Jack Durer get the Governor to give her a call?"</p>

<p>Marty perked up at that. "Could you do that, sir? I mean, really?"</p>

<p>Brown
chuckled. "Hell, yes, son. Here we are spooking around in another state
risking arrest without any real good reason just so the Governor can 
sleep at night. I'd say he owes us, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Abraham laughed. "Yes, sir, I would."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll send a coded fax on the secure line when we get back."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. It would be a real blessing."</p>

<p>"Don't thank me, thank Durer. Blessings come from God, Marty. Jack Durer just tells God where to send 'em."</p>

<h4>Later that evening, the offices of Industrial Mechanix.</h4>

<p>"He went where?" asked Dan Brown.</p>

<p>"Mexico
City, sir. We watched him get on the plane. He didn't get off and the 
plane took off. The ticket was purchased by a Brightfire subsidiary in 
the name of Dirk Pitt."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, spare me," complained Brown. What a melodramatic ass.</p>

<p>"All
right. It's late. Wake Jack up by phone. Tell him to get ready for 
another coded fax. Mexico City? What's the mercenary bastard up to now?"</p>

<p>Another question occurred to him. "Where's the ugly twins?"</p>

<p>"Sir, they're in Memphis in a fleabag motel in a rough part of downtown. They appear to be waiting for somebody."</p>

<h4>Sixteen days later, The Squad -- "Rubicon"</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The
1st Battalion of the 101st Infantry continued to work its way around 
Hill 310 on 10 November. About 1610 Colonel Scott gave the order to 
assault the ridge behind the hill. This assault was the turning point in
the fight for a foothold on the Koecking plateau. Company C, attacking 
with marching fire behind a curtain of shells, succeeded in pushing the 
Germans off the ridge northeast of Hill 310. -- <i>"The XII Corps Resumes the Offensive (8-17 November 1944)" in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/UNITED-STATES-ARMY-WORLD-WAR/dp/B000GU4780/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1227139150&amp;sr=8-2">The Lorraine Campaign</a>, H.T.

</blockquote>

<p>In his dreams the phone rang.</p>

<p>No,
it wasn't in his dreams. His wife's elbow was in his side. Repeatedly. 
He swore that she sharpened it for just such occasions.</p>

<p>Bill 
Curtis rolled over and picked up the handset, the cord caught on the lip
of the nightstand and it jerked out of his hand, bouncing and 
skittering across the floor. He looked at the alarm clock. Damn, he'd 
only been asleep for an hour</p>

<p>Groggily, he searched for the cord and reeled in the handset like a fish on a line.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Curtis?" came the voice. It sounded like Stentinius.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Rubicon. I say again. Rubicon. Authentication Sierra Victor. Rubicon, authentication Sierra Victor."</p>

<p>He sat upright in bed, instantly awake, the adrenaline already pumping.</p>

<p>"Roger that," he acknowledged. "Rubicon, authentication Sierra Victor."</p>

<p>His wife heard the cryptic words and said in alarm, "Bill?"</p>

<p>He was already out of bed. "Gotta go, baby. Now."</p>

<p>"But, what is it?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I, uh, don't know, but they need me."</p>

<p>"Tell me!"</p>

<p>"Really, Cheryl, I don't know for sure. We don't get briefings on unsecure phone lines. But I've gotta go NOW."</p>

<p>And
then, leaping into his militia clothes and pulling on his boots, he 
grabbed a big duffel bag and his rifle case from the closet and he was 
gone.</p>

<p>Each fire team had a muster point in case of trouble. As 
squad leader, Bill and his RTO rallied to Fire Team Alpha, Mike 
Parker's, because it was closest. He was both gratified and embarrassed 
to see that he was the last one there. Bill looked at his watch. 
Fourteen and a half minutes had elapsed since he answered the phone.</p>

<p>"OK,
two pickups, no caps in case we have to unass the vehicles quickly. 
Four men in each truck. Mike, you take the first, I'll take the second. 
GO! Squad muster point at best speed."</p>

<p>No more words were needed. The trucks were gone and down the road in seconds.</p>

<p>Twenty
minutes later they were at the squad muster point. So were the other 
two fire teams and Acting Winston County Sheriff Arthur Curtis Looney 
and three deputies.</p>

<p>Uh, oh.</p>

<p>Bill Curtis got out of the 
pickup truck. So did his RTO and the Alpha team man riding with him. 
Mike Parker and his fire team stepped from their truck with their rifles
ready, trigger fingers extended.</p>

<p>I'm with Mike, he thought, this
doesn't look good. His other two fire teams were standing there in the 
headlights, rifles slung but uneasily eyeing Art Looney and his men. 
Denny Powell and Fire Team Charlie's leader Buster Urqhuart walked over 
to him.</p>

<p>"What's up, Denny?" Curtis asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said his best friend, plainly flummoxed. "The sheriff said he'd tell us when you got here."</p>

<p>"Where's John Stentinius and his support section?"</p>

<p>"I
haven't seen him. I was wondering the same thing." Denny nodded over 
Bill's left shoulder, and Curtis turned to see the Sheriff approaching 
with his men. He and Acting Sheriff Looney were distant cousins, but 
that didn't mean much. Most everybody in Winston County was cousin to 
somebody. Will Shipman had said that the new Sheriff "was on our side." 
However, he hadn't been specific about what that meant.</p>

<p>"Curtis?" Art Looney demanded in a raspy voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Line your men up."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Just do it, we haven't got all day."</p>

<p>"Look, Sheriff..."</p>

<p>"LINE. THEM. UP." He wasn't asking.</p>

<p>All right, Bubba, thought Bill Curtis, but if you try to disarm us you'll lose that argument.</p>

<p>"Shake out a line for the man," he ordered his squad. "By fire teams."</p>

<p>The men obeyed, moving with more speed and certainty than Bill Curtis felt. He fell into line in front of them.</p>

<p>"All right," rasped Looney, "raise your right hands."</p>

<p>What the?</p>

<p>Art Looney was smiling. OK, I get it now. Bill Curtis raised his hand, followed by his squad.</p>

<p>"Repeat after me. 'I', state your name..."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Bill Curtis and his fire team leaders were looking at their Winston County Special Deputy badges.</p>

<p>"They'll have to do," explained Art Looney, "I don't have enough for all of you."</p>

<p>At that moment, John Stentinius pulled up with his support team followed by a car with two suits in it.</p>

<p>The
older of the two came over to Curtis and the Sheriff. Looney made the 
introductions. "Bill, this is Dan Brown, and his assistant Marty 
Abraham. They work for the Governor."</p>

<p>Brown saw the question in Curtis' face. "We're with ABI on special assignment."</p>

<p>"What assignment?" Curtis asked.</p>

<p>It
took ten minutes and reference to two USGS quadrangle maps of Winston 
County spread out over a pickup truck hood for Bill Curtis and his fire 
team leaders to get the picture.</p>

<p>When it was done, Curtis said the first thing that came to his head. "Well, shit and shove me in it."</p>

<p>"Can you accomplish the mission?" asked Brown, eyeing Bill closely.</p>

<p>Curtis
paused, not wanting to say it. Somehow he'd always envisioned the squad
going into action in a war of resistance,. Maneuver warfare, hit and 
run, always fighting on his own terms. This Sheriff's posse stuff was 
going to be more like attrition warfare. We're going to have to be the 
one's to cross the ground and take it to them.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>It 
was one thing to work for years and years to get to this point, but 
quite another to risk his men's lives in the dark based on a stranger's 
say-so. Still, Looney was deferential to the man. That meant he was what
he said he was. And Looney did have the authority to call them out for 
duty. That much was in the law.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think we can do it," he replied to the state man. "Guys?"</p>

<p>He looked at his fire team leaders. Mike Rogers was typically first and forceful.</p>

<p>"Let's do it."</p>

<p>"Denny?"</p>

<p>Denny was smiling. Once a Marine, always a Marine. "Hell, yes. Fire Team Baker is ready."</p>

<p>"Buster?"</p>

<p>Fire
Team Charlie's leader wasn't going to be thought timid, even if he felt
it. "Sure, let's do it. After all, we're just in support right? The DPS
SWAT team has the heavy lifting."</p>

<p>"Look," Dan Brown corrected 
him, "let me recap the briefing and emphasize certain points you may 
have missed. The state SWAT team for this district has been reinforced 
with what we could scrape up, but its still only sixteen guys. They're 
experienced and they're a team, just like you, but they're only sixteen.
The evil bad guys may number as many as twenty or so. They have to be 
dealt with by dawn. We don't know what their specific objectives are, 
but we can guess. They're here to create enough terror in the general 
population to make it easy for the move on Shipman, so we can't risk 
waiting. The Sheriff's deputies -- reinforced with your support 
squad and some of Will Shipman's people -- can probably hold the 
perimeter against a breakout, but they're not trained for dynamic entry 
or assault and they aren't armed to the teeth like you guys. If the 
stealthy approach fails and we lose the element of surprise -- if the 
plan goes south, and they decide to fight it out -- this is going to 
turn into a real rat hunt. And you're going to have get in close to get 
the rats. Understood?"</p>

<p>Buster nodded. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"One 
more thing. Most of you don't have helmets or body armor and we've got 
none within reach to give you. You also have no night vision." Brown 
paused, looking at Buster Urquhart carefully. "Still in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What about Will?" asked Bill Curtis.</p>

<p>"They won't get him," said Brown confidently. "Trust me."</p>

<p>"I'm trusting you with a hell of a lot more than that, Bubba," snapped Curtis.</p>

<p>Brown looked at the squad leader for a long moment.</p>

<p>Finally he said, "Yes, you are."<br><span style="font-size:130%;"><br></span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold;font-size:130%;">The Grateful Dead</span></p>

<p>John
Claxton looked at the peeling wallpaper of the isolated safehouse just 
across the state line in Tennessee. All he could do now was wait. The 
players were in motion, but the plays never exactly turned out the way 
you planned. There was a greater power behind the string of disasters 
that had hit the ATF and Brightfire these past few months since the 
Battle of Sipsey Street and he knew that a significant portion of the 
state government had to have taken position to shield Charlie Quintard 
and his confederates.</p>

<p>But are they expecting THIS?</p>

<p>If you can't stand not knowing...</p>

<p>Claxton
could hear Gonzo and Rizzo slam the doors of a beat-up Chevy Blazer 
with Alabama tags, and then drive off, headed south. They were towing a 
bass boat full of beer coolers and fishing tackle. Well, that's it until
tomorrow. Might as well go back to the motel and get some sleep.</p>

<p>Claxton
stood, collected the briefing materials from the table, and walked out 
the door. Everything was in readiness for the dynamic interrogation of 
Will Shipman. When he got Quintard's whereabouts he would dispatch the 
best Brightfire men available in a helicopter-borne snatch team to go 
get the prick, and ATF could put him on display in Nashville as a 
counter-argument in the propaganda war which the agency -- and 
Brightfire -- were currently losing. If he resisted, he would be a dead 
man two seconds later and they could still put his body on display like 
Che's in Bolivia.</p>

<p>The <i>juju</i> dies with the man. He'd learned that in Africa.</p>

<p>Well,
he would be here when the two stupids got back with Shipman late 
tomorrow. At least they'd get HIM. The militia leader had been hanging 
around home for the past three days since he'd broken his leg in a work 
accident. He wasn't likely to ride to the sound of the guns when he was 
in a cast and hobbling around on crutches, now was he? Plus, Gonzo 
Greene would have a four-man team of Los Zetas to support him. There was
unlikely to be any trouble with Quintard's sponsor, which is how 
Claxton had come to think of him.</p>

<p>After that, Claxton would 
personally squeeze Shipman with Rizzo as his muscle until they had what 
he wanted. Once Claxton had the location, Brightfire could go grab 
Quintard. Gonzo and Rizzo would get their "reward," and all loose ends 
would be tied up. It would be worth the $5 million the complete Zeta 
package had cost the company, although the Brightfire president had 
taken some convincing.</p>

<p>Still, the boss saw the larger logic. The 
company's reputation was on the line. Just like the ATF, Brightfire 
could not afford to look both brutish AND incompetent. Brutish was OK, 
they could live with brutish. But not incompetent. The company had a 
reputation of delivering for their customers, and customers wouldn't 
like it if Brightfire couldn't finish a job, especially if they were 
made to look stupid in the bargain.</p>

<p>Then there was the issue of 
employee morale. A lot of their contractors still believed in that 
"leave no man behind" crap. The corollary to that was "if you are forced
to leave somebody behind, come back and avenge their death by killing 
as many of the other SOBs as possible." Recruitment and retention were 
already down. American bodies to fill slots were getting scarce and much
more expensive. Foreign contractors could fill slots but weren't nearly
as competent at operations within CONUS, where public relations and 
political niceties had to be observed and a little cultural 
understanding went a long way. We have to reassure our contractors that 
we're still the meanest wolf in the pack.</p>

<p>Of course, no one would
be able to tie Brightfire to it legally, but the point would be made 
just the same. Dick with us, and you die. Customers would be reassured, 
and employees would be too. The fact that if it didn't work that HE 
might die was painfully evident to him.</p>

<p>So let it work. He would 
be here to make sure the Muppet twins didn't get carried away. And then 
he would send them to join Jim Henson.</p>

<p>Claxton shut and locked the door, and walked down the creaking steps to his rental car.</p>

<blockquote>

Baby, won't you carry me back to Tennessee?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The
Grateful Dead DVD played over and over on the way down to Winston 
County as Rizzo drove and Gonzo thought. He wasn't as stupid as Claxton 
believed him to be. He turned the thought over and over in his head and 
finally blurted it out.</p>

<p>"Rizzo?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"I know that Claxton prick is gonna do us if we come through on this job."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drink all day and rock all night,<br/>

</blockquote>

<p>Between the wind rushing through the open window of the Blazer and the Grateful Dead, Rizzo couldn't hear right.</p>

<p>"If we DON'T do it?"</p>

<p>"No, if we DO the job, he's still going to kill us. He can't afford to let us live."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dropped four flights and cracked my spine,<br/>
Honey, come quick with the iodine,<br/>

</blockquote>

<p>"Why not? We've done work for him before and he's never complained."</p>

<p>"Rizz, he ain't gonna COMPLAIN about this job. He's just gonna kill us, that's all. If this gets out, he's a dead man."</p>

<p>"OK, so?"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be,<br/>
Baby, won't you carry me back to Tennessee?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"So,
we're the only ones who can tie him to it. And he's playing for bigger 
stakes than he ever has before. This guy we're snatching just ain't some
crooked wise guy. You heard Claxton -- the whole goddam state of 
Alabama is trying to protect this guy."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we gonna 
do? Disappear? He already paid us half up front. We'll lose the other 
half. And then there's the bonus if they get the Indian guy."</p>

<p>"Rizz, we ain't gonna live that long. Don't you get it?"</p>

<p>"Oh. Well, what're we gonna do?" Rizzo asked plaintively in his New Jersey twang.</p>

<p>Gonzo Greene thought a moment, and then he said, "I dunno. I gotta think."</p>

<p>So that's what he did, as they crossed over the Tennessee River on I-65.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I run into Charlie Fog,<br/>

<p>"What
I'm saying is that we can lay down suppressive fire from the BARs and 
the DMs and pound 'em with rifle grenades while you're movin' up. We can
demoralize the hell out of them and then you can call for their 
surrender. You're not plannin' on readin' 'em their rights first, are 
you?" Bill Curtis was frustrated and just this side of pissed.</p>

<p>The
state SWAT team commander had outlined a more detailed plan than Brown 
and it involved a stealthy approach, kick in the doors, standard kind of
police deal that they were used to using with sleeping drug dealers.</p>

<p>The
more Bill, Mike and the rest of the militia command group looked at the
detailed map of the objective, the less they liked it.</p>

<p>This much
was known: the Zetas had been filtering into Winston County for three 
days and all of the ones who had been spotted and tailed ended up here. 
The old chicken farm stood on a rise above the surrounding fields. The 
farmstead included a two story house made of field stone with a rusted 
tin roof. Behind it was an older barn, from before it was a chicken 
farm. It also was two stories tall. The aerial recon photos which had 
been taken of the place just before dusk showed ten cars, trucks and 
panel vans parked behind the house. The chicken houses themselves were 
downhill (and downwind, Bill noticed) from the house so the stink would 
be carried away by the normally prevailing winds.</p>

<p>The entire 
complex was surrounded on all four sides by fields barren of cover and 
whose only concealment was tall grass and clumps of weeds. The place was
a good half-mile from the main road. The tree line in the back was a at
least three hundred meters from the hilltop. The ones to either side 
were probably two or two fifty. This was at the extreme range of the 
rifle grenades. There was a ditch paralleling the farm lane leading from
the inner farm gate out to a creek, which cut through the trees between
the house and the road. A steel I-beam bridge spanned the creek, and 
this is where the Zetas had chosen to place their exterior guard, 
consisting of two men on either side of the road. They also patrolled 
the road from the house to the bridge and back again every two hours 
like clockwork, which was strange. What's the point of that? wondered 
Curtis.</p>

<p>One possible route of approach was from the tree line on 
the right, using the old chicken houses to shield an attacking party. 
But they didn't know for sure that they couldn't be spotted from the 
second story of the house, or from the barn for that matter. There was a
low fieldstone wall that surrounded the place, broken at intervals for 
the farm lanes, old cattle passages and drainage.</p>

<p>But how to get to it without getting spotted and shot?</p>

<p>Mike
Parker had pointed out that ten vehicles probably meant more than 
twenty people. The SWAT scouts using thermal imagers had reported at 
least eight Zetas moving around or standing guard and it was three 
o'clock in the morning. How many others were sleeping behind rock walls 
couldn't be guessed at.</p>

<p>The problem as Bill saw it was the SWAT 
guys trusted their thermal imagers and their night vision too much. They
were used to taking down criminals who lacked their fancy hardware. The
briefing on the Zetas that Brown's man Abraham had given them said they
could just about count on the Mexicans having them too. SWAT was used 
to owning the night all by themselves. But while it was true that all 
the Mexicans probably did not have NODs, Bill bet that there were enough
of them to knock the SWAT commander's stealthy approach into a cocked 
hat.</p>

<p>The other problem was that even with the deputies, John 
Stentinius' squad and Will Shipman's short platoon, they would be 
stretched to hold the entire perimeter against a breakout, especially if
the Mexicans tried filtering out at night. And Zetas with night vision,
once they had penetrated the cordon, could slaughter the deputies and 
the militiamen who lacked NODs. He could offset some of that advantage 
by using the rifle grenade parachute flares to illuminate the 
battlefield, but he doubted his ability to maintain it for long enough 
for the sun to rise.</p>

<p>The more he thought about it, the more he wanted to wait until daylight.</p>

<p>It
was apparent that some of the SWAT guys felt the same way. They were 
mostly veterans of one war or another and they wanted to live through 
this day.</p>

<p>So did Art Looney, Bill could tell.</p>

<p>He turned to Stentinius. "Did you bring all the rifle grenades?"</p>

<p>"Yup.
Got 'em in the truck. Got launching cartridges for the 7.62 NATO rifles
and the Garands and Springfields of course. I even brought the 1903 
rifles, just in case. And, I brought these."</p>

<p>He held out a couple of stubby little rimmed brass cartridges about the size of a .45 ACP case.</p>

<p>"The M7s!" Curtis exclaimed. "I'd forgotten about them. Damned good thinking, sergeant. We'll need 'em for sure."</p>

<p>Stentinius smiled.</p>

<p>"What are they?" the SWAT commander asked. He had no clue. His daddy hadn't even been born when these were made.</p>

<p>Curtis
explained excitedly, "The M7 is an auxiliary cartridge that increases 
the range of the rifle grenade. It's got twenty grains of black powder 
behind that paper wad. You put it in your launcher with the paper end 
toward the muzzle of the rifle and then seat the rifle grenade. It gives
you maybe another 50 meters of range. Thing is though, you'd better not
try shooting it from your shoulder or you'll break it."</p>

<p>"Where did you get them?" asked the SWAT commander.</p>

<p>"The same place we got the BARs and the rifle grenades. Santa Claus."</p>

<p>His guys laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't ever think that Santa Claus doesn't come to Winston County," Bill Curtis added, "because he sure as hell does."</p>

<p>Bill looked into the SWAT commander's face, which showed equal parts puzzlement and irritation. He had an idea.</p>

<p>"Look, Lieutenant, I've got a better notion about how to skin this cat. Give me a minute and let me lay it out for you."</p>

<p>It
took about five minutes, and then he added, "Half of our problem is 
we're this improvised lash up of guys that have never faced this before,
so we've got to give specific tasks to each and make sure our 
communication is tight so we don't blow each other away." The SWAT 
leader nodded. He'd been thinking the same thing but he didn't know how 
to accomplish it.</p>

<p>"Shipman's platoon led by Kurt Garth will hold 
the perimeter from here," he pointed on the map, "to here. Their orders 
will be to only fire on targets attempting to escape that approach 
within fifty meters. The ground rises enough after fifty meters going up
to the farmhouse so that we won't have a Polish firing squad." The 
commander nodded.</p>

<p>"We'll stiffen them up with the other seven 
BARs we have, but their orders are the same. Do not engage outside fifty
meters. Since Shipman's people haven't yet been trained on the BAR, the
operators will be seven men from my support squad. All of them are 
familiar with the BAR, but we'll need assistant gunners and Kurt," he 
nodded toward Will Shipman's platoon commander, "you'll have to provide 
'em. The gunners will give them a quick rundown before we jump off."</p>

<p>Kurt Garth nodded.</p>

<p>"The
deputies will interdict the farm lane where it meets the road. Under no
circumstances should they approach the bridge until they see my green 
flare. That will mean that the sentries been taken from behind by two of
my Designated Marksmen here," he pointed to a position on the map. "The
moment my green flare goes up, John Stentinius, commanding the rest of 
his squad armed with Springfields and rifle grenades, will pound the 
compound as far as they can reach from the tree line at the back using 
the M7 pills to boost the shots. John, use the M19 willy petes first, 
concentrate initially on the vehicles, and then shift to the windows or 
doors you see shots coming from, and any groups of Zetas trying to break
out. Leave ones and twos to the perimeter force. When the vehicles are 
well and truly aflame that will illuminate the inner farmyard and 
silhouette anyone trying to leave running. Begin with ripple firing and 
keep that up as long as you can. I want a continuous pounding on the 
area so that none of these little misunderstood undocumented workers 
wants to stick his nose out of the house. After you get the cars 
burning, set the barn on fire. Use what willy peter you have first and 
then shift to the M9 High Explosive-AntiTank, but for God's sake keep 
your fire away from the chicken houses."</p>

<p>He turned to the SWAT 
commander. "When he begins pounding the farm, you come out of the tree 
line, here," he pointed to the map, "and use the chicken houses to cover
your approach. Come around through this last chicken house using the 
doors, here, and here, and now you've got concealment and some cover for
a base of fire on the house, here. We will come out of the treeline on 
your left flank and we will make for the end of this chicken house, 
here. None of us will move beyond these positions until I fire my red 
flare. When I do John will lift all his fires and secure his end of the 
field from escapees."</p>

<p>"The barn should be burning down around 
their heads by this time so kill anyone who comes out. You see, you'll 
have a good field of fire at them from your end, also engage any 
shooters you spot using these windows and doors, here, and here.</p>

<p>"I
will advance one fire team supported by my own BARs and grenadiers. We 
will hit the ditch, here, and the wall, here, and then extend our 
formation until we have this entire front covered. You'll see that we 
now have a classic L on the bastards. No fratricide, gentlemen. At this 
point it should be a good time to demand their surrender. As you have 
the bullhorn and you will be under cover, I'll leave that to you. When 
they refuse, and I'm sure some of them probably will, we will pound them
for an additional five minutes from these two sides.</p>

<p>"At this 
point, my grenadiers will be using HE-AT rounds but toward the end of 
the five minutes we will switch to white phosphorus and fragmentation 
grenades through any holes we have created plus the doors and windows. 
This will burn the house down from the inside out. Our line will be long
enough so that we can see and engage anyone fleeing this way," he 
pointed to the map, "and you should be able by this time to extend along
the wall here, to kill anyone else coming out the back. At the end of 
five minutes, or if we see signs of their surrender, we will both cease 
fire and await developments. We will not, repeat not, expose ourselves. A
prisoner or two would be good for the news media afterward, but we will
not risk anyone to take them. You will order them in Spanish to throw 
down their weapons, strip naked and advance with their hands on their 
heads. When they do, I will fire two red star clusters, advising 
everyone that the farmhouse is taken. Even so, none of the perimeter 
force will move up until you see two green star clusters. And when you 
do, come in a skirmish line, cautiously."</p>

<p>He turned to the Lieutenant. "Does that meet with your approval, Sir?"</p>

<p>He tried very hard to say it earnestly and without irony.</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Sergeant, it does."</p>

<p>"We
have very little time to get into position. Stentinius' grenadiers will
have to use this road here and walk the farthest, so they should leave 
now. John, drop off about here, march as quietly as you can until about 
here, then stealth walk until you're about a hundred yards from where 
the tree line faces the field and crawl the rest of the way. It is 
unlikely they have any LP/Ops out that far but be ready if you jump 
one."</p>

<p>"Right," said the old Marine.</p>

<p>"When you're in position give me one click on the radio, wait ten seconds and then give me one more."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>"Good luck, John."</p>

<p>"You too, Bill. Semper Fi."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>Stentinius
started shouting orders about the distribution of the war materiel in 
the trucks, splitting his squad and other vital details.</p>

<p>Bill 
Curtis turned to Kurt Garth. "Y'all will have the next longest walk. Do 
it like I told John. Take five minutes right now to have his BAR men 
instruct your assistants then get going. Your drop off is, here," he 
pointed. "And when you get in position, give me two clicks on the radio,
followed ten seconds later by two more."</p>

<p>"You bet, Bill. I'll get going now." They shook hands.</p>

<p>"Sheriff,
your guys leave last, of course. You just motor down to the farm lane 
with your lights off. No slamming doors and no interior lights either, 
then take up position to prevent any vehicles that might get out in the 
first moments from making it to the road. Give me three clicks, followed
ten seconds later by three clicks. OK, sir?"</p>

<p>"Bill, this is the 
first time I've ever taken orders from a special deputy, but I'm damned 
glad to be doing it now. We'll be there. Call us up if you need us."</p>

<p>"Yes,
sir." Bill looked around. "Lieutenant, you and me are going to have the
toughest assignment. Let's go over the map and wargame it again. I 
reckon we've got about twenty minutes until we have to take off."</p>

<p>"Right," said the Lieutenant. "What was your rank in the Army?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am what I always was, Lieutenant, a sergeant." Then he added, "a squad leader."</p>

<p>"You could have fooled me."</p>

<p>"Hell,
Lieutenant, there's no more important position in the Army, the Marines
or the militia than squad leader, didn't you know? It's those last 
hundred yards that bumfuzzles the slickest officers' plans every time. 
That's when they've got to rely on us."</p>

<p>He smiled indulgently at the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Now, let's figure out if we've missed any wrinkles in killing these Zeros."</p>

<p>"Zetas," corrected the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Whatever," said Bill Curtis.</p>

<h4>Zeta</h4>

<p>Raul
Hernandez Lopez was angry and eager to be gone from this place. At dawn
they would break up into attack cells and spread out over Winston 
County. It was time to get them up and moving. They had already been 
thoroughly briefed yesterday on their various missions. The Zeta cells 
would kill as many people as they could, making no distinction as to age
or sex. This was actually their normal rules of engagement so no one 
had any qualms about it.</p>

<p>They were ordered to destroy the 
Sheriff's station and the Post Office. The latter was deemed to be 
important, for it was a federal offense and it was somehow vital to his 
employer's plans that it be hit.</p>

<p>He did not have confidence in 
most of his troops, of which there were fifty-five scattered everywhere 
in the house and barn, sleeping on floors and old hay. The word Zeta 
struck fear into the hearts of law enforcement on both sides of the 
border, but fewer than six of these were true Zetas, graduates of 
Mexcian Army's elite GAFE Special Forces Group. Of those, Lopez himself 
was the only surviving Zeta who had been trained at The School of the 
Americas at Fort Benning. The rest of the men were a mixed bag, some <i>Mara Salvatruchas</i>, some regular Mexican Army veterans, including deserters lured into the shadowy narco trade for the money, some Guatamalan <i>Kaibils</i>. All of them were <i>sicarios</i>, veterans of of the incessant cartel wars, and so all had killed time and again.</p>

<p>But
murderers did not make good soldiers, Lopez knew, and he was likely to 
lose many of them to stupidity before this day was over. No matter. They
were cannon fodder. They were well armed and equipped, but they were 
cannon fodder nonetheless.</p>

<p>Lopez was angry because he had just 
discovered that the roving patrol he had ordered last night had not been
done as he had ordered it. Walking up and down the farm lane to the 
bridge was not his idea of a patrol, but that was how his order had been
interpreted by men who hadn't mastered their fear of the <i>Yanqui</i>
night. He could understand part of their fear. This land of hills and 
thick trees choked him. It played with your head and made you see 
threats that weren't there.</p>

<p>He'd first experienced it at Benning,
and he was glad when he had finally graduated and got back to the clean
high deserts of his native northern Mexico. Of course he'd fought down 
in the jungles of Yucatan and Chiapas, killing rebellious Indians for 
the <i>latifundistas</i> of the PRI in Mexico City, but he'd always hated it.</p>

<p>He hated this place as well, and for the same reasons. And one other: he hated the arrogant <i>gabachos.</i>
He'd hated them since he'd been shamed by a drunken drill instructor at
Benning. Now he would pay Sergeant McMasters back for pissing on him 
while he lay in the red Georgia mud. McMasters had even been from 
Alabama, but further south from here. Too bad. He would pay much to kill
that one. Maybe after this is over I will look him up.</p>

<p>It would 
be dawn soon. Lopez walked up the stairs to the second floor to sweep 
the woods with his thermal imaging scope. He scanned first toward the 
bridge. He could see his two sentries standing on the road, talking, 
smoking cigarettes -- it had better be cigarettes, you stupid <i>cabrones</i>
-- instead of down in their hides along the road. The cigarettes flared
in the imager. I'll deal with them later. There were no side windows in
the upper story, so he walked to the back to scan the far tree line.</p>

<p>It was full of men.</p>

<p><i>Chinga!</i></p>

<p>As
he turned to raise the alarm he heard two shots and a pop toward the 
front and then a series of louder pops from the rear. Outside the 
window, a ghostly green flickered on the fields. Flare, he had time to 
realize.</p>

<p>Then the hell his sainted mother had always warned him about came to visit.</p>

<h4>Shipman and his dogs</h4>

<p>Jesus Rojas had seen a lot of ugly <i>gabachos</i>
before but this man in front of him was the ugliest he had ever seen. 
He had been chosen for this assignment because he had excellent English,
having been raised in LA. He remembered the Schwarzenegger line from 
'Predator': "You are one ugly motherf-cker."</p>

<p>He had sense not to repeat it aloud, but he laughed anyway. The sound was magnified by the small size of the motel room.</p>

<p>"What's so funny?" challenged Gonzo Greene.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Rojas. "Please continue with the briefing."</p>

<p>Greene looked at the Mexican sourly. He hated greasers with a purple passion. But there was the job and he needed them.</p>

<p>"OK,"
he continued, "the diversion starts just after dawn. We give it two 
hours and then Rizzo and me will drive you to the road just above 
Shipman's place, where you'll get out from under the tarps in the boat 
and go through the woods until you get to the side of the house. We'll 
stay on the road, fiddling around under the hood, giving you time to get
into position. We'll wait a half hour, that ought to give you plenty of
time to move in real quiet. If the dogs start barking, shoot them. 
You've got silenced pistols, use them. Then we'll drive up to the front 
and knock on the door like some lost tourists. You come in the back, 
kill his wife and anybody else who's there but we got to take Shipman 
alive. He's got a broken leg so it shouldn't be that tough."</p>

<p>Personally
Rojas could see several holes in the plan, chief among them was the 
presence of several dogs. He preferred quietly poisoning dogs before a 
serious approach to a target. In his life he had killed many a dog that 
way. Shooting dogs, even with a suppressed weapon, was noisy. They 
yelped, they whimpered, they even barked and kept coming at you until 
they died with blood-foam flecking their muzzles. Dogs were loyal. The 
dogs would be a problem.</p>

<p>For now all he said was, "We shall see."</p>

<p>Gonzo
Greene took it as agreement. "Right, well I've been driving all night 
and I'm going to get some rest. You guys don't mind if I rack out on 
this bed, do you?"</p>

<p>The Zetas had no objection. They left the room
and went down the motel sidewalk for the free Continental breakfast in 
the lobby. They were dressed like carpenters, and no one took any notice
of them.</p>

<p>"I don't like trusting Mexicans," observed Rizzo the Rat as he lay on the other bed.</p>

<p>"Me
neither," replied Gonzo, "but we don't have to trust them much. We just
got to use them to get Shipman, then they go their way and we go ours."</p>

<p>"I still don't like it."</p>

<p>"Get some sleep, Rizz, or shut up so I can."</p>

<p>"Right." Rizzo the Rat paused. "Have you figured out what we're gonna do after we get him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Rizz."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<hr/>

<p>"The Zetas are in the restaurant and the Ugly Twins are in the room," crackled the radio.</p>

<p>Dan Brown was glad to be working back on his home ground. The Blazer with the boat was in the trucker parking behind the motel.</p>

<p>"Tag and bug them both," he ordered.</p>

<p>He
began to breathe freely again when the call came that the job was done.
He had left the squad and the Sheriff to return to the main threat. He 
knew their names and records now, and their histories were far uglier 
than their faces. These were two very bad dudes. The plan, Brown now 
understood only too well, was to use the Zetas to create havoc, and for 
the uglies and their helpers to slip in during the chaos and kidnap 
Shipman, take him someplace to torture Quintard's location out of him, 
then snatch Charlie as well. Brown's immediate instinct had been to bust
the twins and as many Zetas as they could catch and short-circuit the 
whole damn thing. He had been overruled by Jack Durer.</p>

<p>"Dan, the farther we let this play out, the more it works to our advantage," Durer had said.</p>

<p>Not
for the first time, Dan Brown wondered how Jack Durer defined "our". 
When Jack used the royal "we" you just didn't know. He kept it that way,
Brown knew, just to keep people wondering how far his influence really 
extended. It was part of the Durer mystique. But right now he didn't 
like it one damn bit. If this went south and Shipman got hurt, or worse,
if some innocents got killed by some Zeta terrorists they'd missed, the
blowback was going to land in his lap.</p>

<p>He'd asked in exasperation, "Are we supposed to let them get Shipman?"</p>

<p>Durer
ignored the sarcasm. "Don't be a worrywart, Dan. You've got these guys 
under the microscope, right? Just let it play out to the point where 
they commit illegal acts on Alabama soil, and I don't care if it's 
spittin' on the sidewalk. Then take 'em down. 'Course if you get 
surveillance video and audio of them planning to snatch Shipman, that'll
be better. Just get me that prisoner we talked about. And let Shipman 
handle his own security at the house. He's got the people to do it, he 
knows they're coming and we don't want to have to explain why you're 
there if we can help it. No fingerprints."</p>

<p>"Right, Jack," he'd said in resignation as much as anything else. "Will do."</p>

<p>Well,
he'd still managed to get caught with his pants down. They didn't have 
exact intel on the Zetas, didn't know where their rendezvous was going 
to be, didn't know how many, or when the strike day was. Hell, if the 
twins hadn't led him to this Zeta team, he wouldn't have known about 
them either. It wasn't until he put the reports of hard-looking Mexicans
drifting into Winston County together with the news of Claxton and the 
twins meeting across the state line that he undertood he was looking at D
minus one and counting. He thought Durer was crazy when he urged him to
rely on the militia. He understood how, for political reasons, the 
Governor wanted to keep this a joint state-local operation. But using 
the militia as a Sheriff's posse made him nervous. However, both Shipman
and Curtis had surprised him with their competence. He'd hate to go up 
against either of them in a straight fight.</p>

<p>He knew that the 
battle with the main body of Zetas was probably over by now but he 
hadn't heard how the fight for the farm had went. Durer was right 
though, in the grand scheme of things, this was more important.</p>

<p>So he sat in his car with Marty Abraham and waited for the uglies to make their move.</p>

<hr/>

<p>How it went was pretty much according to Bill Curtis' plan.</p>

<p>Except it didn't, not entirely.</p>

<p>Curtis
had looked at his watch and then up at the Mexican sentries smoking and
laughing. He took out the flare pistol from the holster on his load 
bearing vest and extended his arm up. The DM's in prone position two 
meters away had signaled that they had their targets. "Take 'em," Curtis
ordered. He waited until he saw both sentries crumple on the road, 
cigarettes still in their hands, then he fired the flare.</p>

<p>The 
ripple fire of ten white phosphorus grenades, boosted by the M7 pills, 
landed dead on the vehicle park in the back of the house. Half of the 
second volley of ten was directed at the barn, which caught fire 
immediately. Screaming Zetas with burning willy peter embedded in them 
ran like headless chickens in all directions.</p>

<p>As the squad and 
the SWAT team emerged from the tree line on a dead run making for the 
cover of the chicken houses, a Guatemalan <i>Kaibil</i> who had slept in the old feed room of the first one in order to escape the snores of his <i>companeros</i>
saw them out the window in the reflected light of the willy peter and 
took them under fire with his AK-47. One of the SWAT guys, hit in both 
legs, went down. His team ran on and killed the Guat with the 
concentrated fire of at least six weapons.</p>

<p>When they made the 
inside of the chicken house and looked toward their next objective, one 
of the SWAT guys yelled, "Goddamn, there's hundreds of them!"</p>

<hr/>

<p>From
his position at his end of the second chicken house, Bill Curtis looked
around the corner. The farmyard looked like an upturned anthill on 
fire. God, how many of them were there? Too many to immediately make his
maneuver. The SWAT guys held up their part of the bargain and began 
killing Zetas by the bushel as they streamed out of the barn from their 
position in the chicken house.</p>

<p>Many of the Zetas made for the 
front of the farmhouse, fleeing into the gunfire because they feared 
Sergeant Willy Peter more. It was a target made for the squad. BARs, 
DMs, grenadiers, riflemen all joined in the killing spree. Return fire 
from the barn refugees was feeble and sporadic.</p>

<p>Not so, from the 
house. Accurate automatic weapons fire was coming from both upper and 
lower windows. Because of the angle, most of it was aimed at the squad. 
He had a man down in Alpha team, how bad he didn't know. Then each BAR 
man took a window and hosed it with measured, rolling bursts while the 
grenadiers ran out into the fire and put AT grenades into the rock 
structure below and beside the windows. Back to cover to reload. Then 
again. The fire from the upper windows fell off to nothing. Men still 
fought from the lower level, though. A grenadier went down. No, he was 
up, dragging his leg but carrying his weapon.</p>

<p>Curtis' heart wanted to burst.</p>

<p>Alpha
team took off before the he fired his second flare. He started to order
them back but realized that if Mike Parker was taking the initiative it
was for a good reason.</p>

<p>Parker's men made the ditch and began 
firing at targets who had gathered on the far side of the house. Their 
rounds coincided with a great whoosh as an RPG rocket, it's operator's 
aim interfered with when a militia bullet hit him between the eyes, went
sailing over Bill's head by about three feet and blew up in the field 
beyond. Another Zeta tried to pick up the RPG and was nailed by Parker's
DM.</p>

<p>Late in the game, a Chevy pickup truck blew out from behind 
the house, knocked down a cattle gate and fled through the fields headed
to the lane, the road and what they thought was safety. The windows had
all been blown out and the bed was packed with panicked screaming men. 
Alpha Team's grenadier aimed at it but Mike stopped him. "The house! The
house!" he shouted.</p>

<p>An HE-AT rifle grenade hit the roof of the 
house. Oh, shit. He fired his second flare, not even remembering loading
it. The grenadiers in the treeline behind the house ceased fire. Shit, 
we've stopped forward movement. He shifted Baker to the left, 
maintaining suppressive fire to the left of the structure. Charlie Team 
continued dueling with the shooters in the bottom right window. There 
were twenty Charlie bullets going in for every Zeta round coming out. 
Bill Curtis smiled. Good, that's the way it's supposed to work.</p>

<p>Parker's
boys managed to make it almost to the wall when they discovered that 
several barn refugees had taken refuge there. Parker's BAR man went down
and Parker himself had the top of his ear shot off when he popped up to
shoot at the house.</p>

<p>"Sonofabitch!" he screamed. "Grenades!" he 
ordered. He took one off his harness, pulled the pin and let the spoon 
fly. God, let these fuses still be good. He and three of his men threw 
them at the same time, then ducked back.</p>

<p>Four huge booms and then there was a single shriek and then nothing. "Again!" Parker ordered.</p>

<p>It was unnecessary, the Zetas were all very dead. They did not feel the second volley at all.</p>

<p>Parker's
replacement BAR man and the grenadier, who knew better than to take 
their attention off the critical task of keeping their own fire up, had 
pretty much discouraged the fire from the windows.</p>

<p>Pretty much, but not completely.</p>

<p>Raul
Hernandez Lopez was badly wounded by shrapnel from a rifle grenade and 
he could no longer hear. He was concussed and he fought to clear his 
mind. The Zeta had failed, so he was a dead man anyway, now or later in 
Mexico. He had dragged himself to the back window and seen his men 
heaped in windrows, burning. He now saw the same in the front. The barn 
blazed merrily and his antagonists were plainly visible from the second 
floor as they popped up and down at different places on the wall, never 
at the same place twice.</p>

<p>Who were these people? He recognized the
signature of the BARs and saw for himself that his attackers were using
old-fashioned rifle grenades. Who were these <i>gabachos</i>?
Not police, surely. They fought like disciplined troops. But they 
weren't armed like the National Guard. He guessed he'd die not knowing.</p>

<p>The loud speaker was blaring "<i>Suelta tu armas! Pon tus manos en tu cabezas!</i>"
Lopez couldn't hear it. He picked up a Kalashnikov and checked the 
magazine. The last Zeta fighting shuffled over to the window, every step
a chorus of pain, and raised the AK to his shoulder, his aim wobbly. He
was trying for the leader. He thought one last time about the high 
deserts of northern Mexico, pulled the trigger and the Kalashnikov began
to chatter.</p>

<p>Below, Mike Parker's replacement BAR man spotted 
movement in the window. He shoved Mike Parker down from behind, just 
like his grandfather told him, and had just raised his automatic rifle 
to fire when Lopez loosed off the burst. At the same instant, the 
grenadier put a white phosphorus round dead center on the Zeta's 
breastbone and sent him burning in pieces to his reward.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Lopez
missed Mike Parker but hit the man who saved his life with two 7.62 
slugs in the lungs. Like the rest of the militiamen, Thomas Powell was 
not wearing body armor. Denny Powell's son was still alive when they put
him in the LifeFlight helicopter, but he died before he could reach the
medical center. His grandfather was with him when he died. Tommy was 
sixteen and big for his age. He would never get any bigger. But like his
Cherokee warrior ancestors he had been true to his vision, and he had 
been willing to make the trade.</p>

<p>The butcher's bill was later 
determined to be one dead and five wounded out of Bill Curtis' squad, 
two of those seriously. Two state troopers had been killed and six 
wounded, one in critical condition. Their kevlar helmets and body armor 
had saved many. The truckload of Zetas never made it past the deputies, 
who captured two, both wounded, and killed the rest. There were no 
deputies hit in the exchange.</p>

<p>Total Zeta casualties, determined 
after the forensics teams had combed the shells of the house and barn, 
were 46 dead, 7 wounded, one of whom later died, and 3 unwounded 
prisoners. All of the survivors were eager to talk.</p>

<p>They cleared 
the house before it burned down, leaving the bodies, removing one 
wounded Zeta and taking all the weapons and documents they could find.</p>

<p>Among these was the briefcase and laptop of Raul Hernandez Lopez.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Will
Shipman was grateful to be free of the cast. He understood the need for
Durer's deception, but it had been a pain in the ass, literally. Brown 
had said over the radio that they could expect visitors within the next 
half hour. That had been twenty minutes ago. He held the silenced M-3 
loosely, feeling the old sweat slick his palms.</p>

<p>When the Mexicans
got to the treeline around the Shipman place, they halted. No dogs, 
thought Rojas. That was a bad sign. As much as he'd been worried about 
the dogs, he was more worried about their absence.</p>

<p>It was a set up.</p>

<p>He
motioned his men to back up toward the road, when the clacking began. 
There was a lot of clacking. When the clacking stopped Rojas and his 
three Zetas were quite truly dead, riddled with .45 caliber slugs. He 
would never worry about dogs again, nor poison another one, come to 
that.</p>

<p>Gonzo Greene had decided time was just about up when a 
beat-up old Ford pickup, so rusted out that it was missing its bed, came
down the road toward the Blazer, the boat, the upraised hood, Gonzo, 
and Rizzo.</p>

<p>"Let me handle this," hissed Gonzo to Rizzo the Rat.</p>

<p>The
truck pulled to a stop beside them, and a youngish, dark-faced, bearded
local leaned out the open window. "You fellers need any help?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gonzo, looking intently at the local, "she's just been running rough. She'll make it back to Birmingham."</p>

<p>"Birmingham? I thought y'all were from Tennessee."</p>

<p>Gonzo
Greene froze. His pistol was tucked under his jacket in the small of 
his back. He was too far from the pickup's door to grab the man and had 
nowhere to run.</p>

<p>At once he was overcome with curiosity. How did he know? Was he a Brightfire agent?</p>

<p>So he asked, "Who are you? Are you Brightfire?"</p>

<p>The young man smiled, "Naw, my name's Charlie."</p>

<p>In
the instant before he died, Gonzo Greene recognized the face, beneath 
the beard, from the dossier Claxton had shown him. He made to go for his
pistol, but Charlie Quintard just raised his elbow and from beneath it,
poked the muzzle of the MAC-10's sound suppressor that he'd been 
cradling in his lap, up and over the old door and fired twice.</p>

<p>Whether Gonzo got to meet Jim Henson in the afterlife is unknown.</p>

<p>But in informed circles it is doubted.</p>

<p>Stunned as he was at Gonzo's sudden demise, before Rizzo the Rat could react Charlie had his MAC up and pointed at him.</p>

<p>"Now I don't want to kill you and you don't want to be dead," Charlie said, still smiling.</p>

<p>Rizzo nodded dumbly, still looking at his only friend's body.</p>

<p>Charlie loved that line from <i>Silverado</i>.
He'd watched it over and over again during his convalescence on Mrs. 
Walker's old VCR machine. He identified with Danny Glover's struggle 
with predatory law enforcement.</p>

<p>"Now," said Charlie reasonably, 
"you're gonna put your hands on top of your head and I'm gonna get out 
of this pickup truck. If you try to hurt me, I'll take you to Dead Man's
Holler, and you don't want to go there. OK?"</p>

<p>Rizzo the Rat nodded his head. Dead Man's Holler? What was he going to do without Gonzo?</p>

<p>Charlie keyed the mike on his radio three times.</p>

<p>Forty
minutes later, the state highway patrol was investigating the discovery
of a fisherman shot to death on a lonely road in Winston County. They 
had taken the call because the Sheriff's department was knee-deep in the
aftermath of the successful takedown by state and local law enforcement
of a terrorist plot out of Mexico to kill the citizens of Winston 
County.</p>

<p>But as the state trooper looked at the dead man's look of terminal surprise there was just one thought in his mind.</p>

<p>This is the ugliest bastard I have ever seen. Hell, he looks like that Muppet, what's his name?</p>

<p>Bonzo?</p>

<p>No, Gonzo.</p>

<p>Yeah, Gonzo. What an ugly human being.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Dan Brown was fuming when he finally got the cell phone call.</p>

<p>"Where the hell have you been?" he fairly shouted at Will Shipman. "We found Gonzo and the Zetas. Do you have Rizzo?"</p>

<p>"Sure, no problem, you can come get him now. We've got what we wanted out of him."</p>

<p>"What? What was that?"</p>

<p>"Don't
worry. Just come get him. You'll find him tied to the tree out front of
the old Miller place about a mile down on the right from my house. 
Jimmy Flynn will be here having fun watching the ants crawl all over 
him."</p>

<p>In the backgound, Rizzo the Rat cringed.</p>

<p>It had been
easy to break Rizzo. Like many sadists who torture for fun, the deeper 
motivation is that by inflicting pain they control their own worst fears
of having it inflicted on them. Witness pedophiles, who are often 
abused as children themselves and then spend the rest of their lives 
fighting their own panic and loss of control by inflicting it on others.</p>

<p>Rizzo
was easy. They didn't even have to hurt him. They just tied him to the 
tree while Will had asked the questions and Charlie Quintard had gently 
touched the tip of his knife blade to Rizzo's face and various other 
parts of his body.</p>

<p>Did I mention that Rizzo was naked when he was bound?</p>

<p>Anyway,
they had what they wanted from Rizzo, so Dan Brown could have him. 
Because he was a law enforcement officer, he couldn't have been involved
in what Will and his boys had just done to Rizzo the Rat. But Shipman 
was no longer interested in violations of Alabama State Code. He'd heard
the audio disc of Claxton and Saako. He knew that if their plan had 
been successful, a lot of Winston County folks would be dead right now, 
including his beloved wife.</p>

<p>No, he was operating according to a 
much older code. One that Aunt Jenny Brooks would have understood. He 
was going to Tennessee. And now, thanks to Rizzo the Rat, he knew 
exactly where. He could have asked Dan Brown but the state man, 
rightfully suspicious of why he would want the information, wouldn't 
have told him.</p>

<p>Claxton had tried to send a message. He had failed.</p>

<p>Now it was time for Winston County to send him one.</p>

<p>Postage due.</p>

<hr/>

<p>A
few questions to Rizzo the Rat convinced Dan Brown of what was going to
happen next. The question is, he thought, do I try to stop it? Do I 
kick this one upstairs to Jack? The voices of Saako and Claxton on the 
disc came back to him. The Brightfire mercenary was someone who wouldn't
stop at anything to further his company's economic interests. This 
Brown knew. He also knew the outlines of the immediate plot against 
Shipman from the bugs they had planted in Gonzo's car and boat.</p>

<p>The
Mexicans in particular had been very unhappy about the details as they 
bounced up and down under the tarp on their way to Shipman's. They had 
groused bitterly among themselves. Well, thought Brown, they are past 
caring now. But the evidence of the recordings, along with what he had 
been told was in Raul Hernandez Lopez' briefcase, was enough to tie 
Brightfire to the mass murder plot of the Zetas. And the disc was enough
to tie that to the ATF. The Attorney General was going to have fun with
this.</p>

<p>But did they need Claxton to make the case? Dan supposed 
Claxton could tie the plot to the Brightfire leadership, but he'd never 
be alive by the time his trial rolled around. Besides, Claxton was 
across the state line in Tennessee, out of his jurisdiction. He could 
hardly kidnap the man, just to put him in protective custody.</p>

<p>Dan
Brown decided that neither he nor the state of Alabama much cared 
whether John Claxton lived or died. He issued orders for the 
surveillance of Claxton at the safe house in Tennessee to be lifted.</p>

<hr/>

<p>At
the safe house, John Claxton's cell phone buzzed. He looked at the ID. 
It was Dody Saako. Shit. She was the last person in the world Claxton 
wanted to talk to right now. He flipped open the cell phone.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Saako
was frantic. "Have you seen what's happened down there? The state is 
putting on a dog-and-pony show about some Zeta plot to kill innocent 
people in Winston County. It's on all the national networks. They've got
bodies lined up outside this farmhouse and the whole place looks like 
they fought World War III there. What's happening?"</p>

<p>Claxton was 
unperturbed. The Zetas were always expendable. Rizzo had called him from
Gonzo's cell phone. Gonzo was dead but Shipman was on his way to 
Tennessee to meet his destiny in the form of John Claxton. Brightfire 
would not be despised.</p>

<p>He said simply, "I am awaiting further developments."</p>

<p>"You're what?" Sako began. Then, "Uh, I, well, I guess that's all you can do."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Claxton.</p>

<p>Why, the broad was smart enough to figure it out. Three points for the "Blowfly."</p>

<p>"Uh, all right, I'll just await further developments too."</p>

<p>"You do that."</p>

<p>Claxton
clicked the cell phone shut. At that precise moment, 'further 
developments' kicked in the front and back doors of the safe house 
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Claxton had lived all his life by Waco Rules. It 
had been the formative event of his career. Now he discovered Winston 
County Rules. He was still trying to work out the difference between the
two when the vision in his dying eyes faded. The last thing he saw in 
this world was Will Shipman and Charlie Quintard looking down at him 
without pity, the smoke curling out of the suppressors of the submachine
guns in their hands and the whorling, dancing patterns it made as it 
went floating up the peeling wallpaper.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Dody Saako picked up the phone in her office. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Ms. Saako, this is Robert Williams, Jr., the Attorney General of Alabama."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Dody Saako snapped off the question.</p>

<p>"Ma'am,
I'd like you to come to Montgomery next week to testify before a grand 
jury looking into the events of yesterday in Winston County."</p>

<p>"What the hell has that got to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am, do you know an employee of the Brightfire corporation named John Claxton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we've been introduced. I don't know where he is, if that's what you're asking."</p>

<p>"Well,
ma'am, if you know him then perhaps you can confirm that this is his 
voice? I'd like to play a portion of an audio disc we received."</p>

<p>Without further ado, Robert Williams hit "play" on the machine.</p>

<p>"We are coming into a period of our country's history where there will be many bodies on the ground."</p>

<p>Oh, God, thought Saako. Oh, God.</p>

<p>God did not hear her, and the disc ran on.</p>

<p>"In fact, there already are. Surely no one will pay much notice to two more? Don't you agree?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Good. Now, as I said, let me take care of this. We WILL make our point."</p>

<p>Robert Williams' deep baritone voice came back on. "Ms. Saako, would you please confirm that this is John Claxton's voice?"</p>

<p>Dody
Saako looked dully at the picture of the current President of the 
United States on the wall. She ignored Robert Williams, Jr.</p>

<p>It 
had all been for nothing. The scheming, the calculated self-debasement, 
the sexual favors, the ass-kissing, the deliberate framing of innocent 
men, the terrorization of their families, all to further her career in 
an agency that valued ruthlessness in its employees... It had all 
been for nothing.</p>

<p>"Ms. Saako?" she heard Robert Williams say in the distance.</p>

<p>She hung up the phone.</p>

<p>Eight
and a half minutes later, still staring at the image of the President 
of the United States, "Blowfly" Saako ate her own gun.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sarah
Abraham sat on her mother's couch, watching television vacantly and 
thinking of Marty. The kids were finally, thankfully, asleep. Her 
husband and his damned career had stretched her a dozen different ways 
for as long as she could remember and she didn't see that he was getting
anywhere for all his trouble.</p>

<p>She knew she wasn't. Even when he 
came home he was preoccupied and distant. He said he couldn't tell her 
what he'd been doing, only that it was important. Couldn't tell her?</p>

<p>Hmmph.
'Wouldn't' was more like it. What bothered her most of all was that her
mother, who had never cared much for Marty, was starting to make sense 
in her criticism. This from a woman who hadn't made much sense on the 
big things of life since Sarah was old enough to sort things out for 
herself.</p>

<p>How did Sarah know he wasn't cheating on her, her mother had asked. Well, her mother always had been a foolish <i>yenta</i> and it didn't seem likely, but what was it that could be so important?</p>

<p>The
doorbell rang, but Sarah paid no attention, even though the hour was 
late. Her mother would get it and she was still intently picking at the 
psychic scab that barely covered her wounded ego.</p>

<p>So it wasn't 
until a deep voice from behind her called, "Mrs. Abraham?" that she 
reacted. Turning her head, she saw who it was and leaped from the couch 
as if she had been shot from a cannon.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Abraham,"
said Ray Marsh kindly, "I didn't mean to startle you." Her mother stood
behind the Governor, eyes wide, mouth agape.</p>

<p>"Oh, God," blurted Sarah Abraham, "is Marty...?" She couldn't finish it. Concern flooded Ray Marsh's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, your husband's fine," the Governor hastened to add. "I'm truly sorry to have scared you. No, he's fine. Just fine."</p>

<p>Sarah Abraham sank back down onto the couch in relief.</p>

<p>"He
is a little tired. He's been working hard for me on a special project. 
But he's just fine. He's been gone for a while and he couldn't get away,
but he asked me to drop by and let you know that he's fine and he'll be
home soon to see you."</p>

<p>Ray Marsh walked around the end table and knelt down in front of Sarah Abraham, taking her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Marty asked... you? And you... came here? All the way down here from Montgomery?"</p>

<p>"He's
one of the very best men we have in the service of this state, Mrs. 
Abraham. These are terrible times in Alabama. Perilous times. And if it 
weren't for dedicated, honorable agents like Marty we would be in a lot 
worse shape than we are. I wanted to tell you that too. The sad thing is
that good men like Marty have to neglect their families at times like 
these. But I want you to know that he wouldn't be doing what he's doing 
if I hadn't asked him to, because the state needs his capable service 
right now."</p>

<p>"He's been gone for so long..." Sarah began.</p>

<p>"I
know," said the Governor kindly, "you've barely seen him in almost 
three months. But please, forgive him. It's my fault really. Mine and 
the times. I can't tell you what he's been doing, but I can tell you 
that both Marty and I believe that we're working for the future of Andy 
and Amy and the future of all the other children of this state. When 
he's done with the job, I'll see that he gets some time off with you and
your children and that he's compensated for his sacrifice. For his 
sacrifice and for yours. We need more men like Marty, and Mrs. Abraham...
he needs you. I just wanted you to know that. I'm sorry for the 
lateness of the hour, but things are pretty hectic in Montgomery these 
days. I should have done this weeks ago, but I've been unable to get 
free. Finally, I just had to make time to do it."</p>

<p>Sarah Abraham looked into the Governor's eyes. "It's that important?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sarah, it's that important. Please forgive him, and forgive me, if you can."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>The Governor released her hand and stood.</p>

<p>"One
more thing, Sarah," Ray Marsh said as he looked sharply at Marty 
Abraham's mother-in-law. "It would be best if no one knew I was here 
tonight, or that Marty was working on important state business. It's a 
matter of keeping him safe while he does his his job. Do you understand,
Mrs. Stieglitz?"</p>

<p>Clara Stieglitz nodded, unable to speak.</p>

<p>Sarah stood up, walked over to the Governor and kissed him on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said.</p>

<p>The Governor flushed red as a beet.</p>

<p>"I will pray for you, Governor. I will pray for you and for Marty and for all of us."</p>

<p>Ray Marsh recovered, said his goodbyes, and let himself out the front door.</p>

<p>"You kissed the Governor," Clara Stieglitz said accusingly, half in wonder and half in horror.</p>

<p>Sarah
Abraham pled guilty. "Yes, Mother, I did. And if you tell anybody about
it, or about the Governor being here or what Marty's doing, I'll slit 
your throat and bury you in the back yard under your petunias."</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, Clara Stieglitz was frightened by her youngest daughter. But she said, "You're not serious."</p>

<p>"Try me," said Sarah, and without another word went upstairs to check on the kids.</p>

<p>They would be going home tomorrow.</p>

<hr/>

<p>They
buried Tommy Powell two days later. He had been assigned to Mike 
Parker's fire team because the squad had all agreed that no two members 
of the same family would serve in the same fire team. Mike, whose life 
he had saved, was, if possible, more broken up about the boy's death 
than his parents.</p>

<p>Why did he do what he did? Parker asked himself
that question time and again. Why save me? They gave out Congressional 
Medals of Honor for that kind of thing in Iraq. Here the boy just got 
the thanks of a grateful state as expressed in a memorial service eulogy
by Ray Marsh.</p>

<p>Just words. Sincere, but just words. It wasn't enough.</p>

<p>Mike Parker pinned his own Silver Star on the boy before they closed the casket and it still wasn't enough.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>He
couldn't figure it out, and it ate at him. When they'd put him on the 
medevac, the boy had actually been smiling, like he'd just aced a test 
in high school, or stolen a kiss from the prettiest girl on the block. 
Mike Parker could close his eyes and still see that smile. He drank 
himself to sleep that night after the funeral and it didn't help.</p>

<p>Just
before dawn though, Tommy Powell walked up to him and told him why. An 
old man was with the boy, and together they explained it. When Mike 
Parker opened his eyes an hour later, he remembered and he understood. 
Somehow Tommy had known what was going to happen before it did, and he 
went anyway. He'd known, he'd seen it in a vision, and he'd gone out of 
duty.</p>

<p>Duty.</p>

<p>And he'd done it, he explained to Mike Parker, not for him in particular, so Mike didn't need to feel guilty.</p>

<p>He'd done it, Tommy Powell told him, for the squad.</p>

<p>In Ireland many years ago or so the legend says<br/>
Saint Patrick roamed the hills and glens to drive the snakes away,<br/>
But now we have another saint that's bad news for the crown<br/>
His name is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLyWfBcDydw">"One Shot Paddy"</a> and it's Brits that he will hound!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In
the Wild Irish Rose pub on Long Street in Columbus, Ohio, the band was 
off tempo and the lead singer off key, but they mor e than made up in 
enthusiasm what they lacked in musical skill. The pub crowd didn't mind.
The drunks howled along with the band, making electronic surveillance 
impossible, so Sean McGrory didn't mind in the least.</p>

<p>The American opposite him at the table didn't mind either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Brits are getting worried they've all gone underground<br/>
If "One Shot Paddy" sees them they know they're going down<br/>
So the next time that you see the Brits with their faces full of fright<br/>
Look out for "One Shot Paddy" and his friend called Eamon Wright!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"That wouldn't be you, they're singing about, would it?" the American asked, wondering for the tenth time why he was here.</p>

<p>"Yeah.
We're all One-Shot Paddy's these days, the one's who are still alive." 
The accent was harsh, nasal and Belfast all over. The American didn't 
know a heck of a lot about the Irish but he knew that. He took the 
double jigger of Bushmills and dropped it into the pint. Then he grabbed
the mug and tossed some down. Beejeezus! No wonder the Irish kill each 
other.</p>

<p>"So, you asked me here," said the American, "how can I help you?"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through the hills of South Armagh this gallant hero roams<br/>
He'll wander through the countryside he likes to call his home,<br/>
And when he finds a target he will quietly take his aim,<br/>
It is then that you will hear the crack and Brits know who's to blame!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McGrory
didn't hesitate. The American had been referred to him by a local 
NORAID fundraiser, and vetted by people McGrory trusted. He'd spent 
plenty of time on the ragged edge of gun running and usually could sniff
a set-up. This seemed straight-up, but...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brits are getting worried they've all gone underground<br/>

<p>"I hear you have some items we might find useful."</p>

<p>"A
buddy of yours said you're looking for specific hardware. We met at the
Ohio Gun Collectors Association Show where I have a regular table. I 
had a copy of Guerrilla Days in Ireland by Tom Barry I was reading and I
guess he keyed on that. We started talking Irish history and politics, 
and the next thing I know, I get invited to a NORAID benefit."</p>

<p>So if you're home at night and the newsflash it is red,<br/>

<p>The
American looked up at the band, then continued, "Of course, I was smart
enough not to go. I figure, hey, if you're needing what he hinted 
you're needing, we don't want to do our meeting and greeting where the 
FBI hangs out, right?"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>McGrory
smiled and nodded. "That's right, Yank. Too bloody well right. Ever 
since George Harrison got pinched in '81, its been pretty tough to 
transport armaments from the US. And with the seizure of the Marita Ann 
last month, it's been tougher still. We still get arms from Libya, but 
their Kalashnikovs are shite fer snipin'. We need something with more 
range and power."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed the American, "I heard about the boat. How much did you lose?"</p>

<p>The band started another song, something ripped off of the Wolfe Tones. They did it as badly and as loudly as One-Shot Paddy.</p>

<p>"Seven
bloody TONS. Rifles, pistols, submachine guns, ammunition, explosives. 
All of it collected in Boston. We used Boston cops as guards, did ye 
know? They were always loyal Irishmen before. The FBI put out that they 
used some bloody great electronic eavesdroppin' on us, even claimed they
followed us by satellite, but it was really the old story."</p>

<p>"What's that?" the American half-shouted over the band.</p>

<p>"Paid
spies and informers. One of them's not goin' home to mother, I can tell
ye. But seven bloody TONS! What we coulda done with that lot." He 
looked the American in the eyes and the Yank returned his challenging 
gaze without a blink.</p>

<p>So what was that, the American wondered, a 
warning not to double cross him? Like I needed it. I may not have ever 
been across the Atlantic, but I'm not stupid enough to cross the 
Provisional Irish Republican Army. Still, if he's worried about me 
double-crossing him, maybe that means he's not going to double back on 
me either. Maybe. There was a large part of the American that didn't 
want to be here in the first place.</p>

<p>The Provo continued, "So 
we're doing this next a bit different, is all." He didn't elaborate, but
it meant smaller loads, precise scheduling, moving through different 
ports of exit and entry. He continued, "What we want are small packages 
of arms suitable for sniping at distance, with telescopic sights, range 
finders, binoculars, support equipment, ammunition all included, ready 
to deliver to the boys at the front."</p>

<p>"I heard you're partial to Armalite 180s," observed the American, "or AR15s."</p>

<p>"Aye,
we were. Prefered the Armalites over the Colts. Nothin' beats that 
foldin' stock fer slidin' it under a coat. But we need more range. The 
Brits and the Ulsters mostly use SA80s now and they can cover us up with
fire. In order to get within the killin' range of an Armalite or a 
Colt, we've gotta get within killin' range of them. We don't have the 
ammunition stocks to match 'em round for round, nor the numbers. We've 
got to shoot and scoot. One shot, one kill, home to mother by supper and
I'll see yer friends tomorrow. They own the battlefield out to 300 
meters. What we want is something that out-ranges and out-penetrates the
5.56mm round. Something in 7.62 NATO or bigger. Something that can 
punch through their bloody body armor or the sides of a Rover."</p>

<p>"I
thought Tom Barry said you didn't have to be a crack shot at seven 
yards -- if you were close enough to grab them by the belt buckle," 
offered the American.</p>

<p>McGrory looked at the American sharply, 
plainly angered. "Try it sometime Yank. Try it. Tom Barry didn't have to
deal with SA80s and body armor and Kevlar helmets. And he never sprang 
an ambush where he didn't have local superiority in numbers. The problem
with grabbin' the Brits by the belt buckles is gettin' 'em to stand 
still while you run up and do it. If fookin' Tom Barry had been in my 
boots, he'd-a been dead by now. That's what I know about bloody 
legendary Tom Barry."</p>

<p>The American nodded. "OK. OK. Our interests
coincide, as they say. I know just what you need, and I can provide 
it. Not in great numbers and only this once. I don't do it free either. I
can't say I believe in your cause all that much. You guys are still 
socialists, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, so?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I just gave all that up when somebody talked some sense into me."</p>

<p>"Yer
an American, you can afford to be a bloody capitalist. What I want 
before economic justice is my country back from a foreign occupier. 
You'd be a pretty poor Yank if you didn't believe in that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't say that the British have a right to be there, they don't. But the bombings..."</p>

<p>McGrory
cut him off. "I'm not a bomber. I'm a soldier. The only people I've 
killed were the soldiers of a foreign power standing on my homeland. I'm
not wantin' to buy explosives from you, I'm wantin' yer bloody rifles. 
And I'll pay. Rory told you that much."</p>

<p>The American nodded. "OK.
OK. Look, I'll do it for retail plus ten percent, and that's as close 
to charity as I can get. You get a bargain from me now because I'm 
getting out of the business. My wife's divorcing me and I need every 
penny I can raise. So think of this as a fire sale. Unless you steal the
rifles, you'll never get a better deal. And don't expect another. I'm 
done after this."</p>

<p>The Provisional IRA man nodded. It was a better
deal than he had hoped, even if the American had pissed him off with 
his compromisable scruples. Sean had some questions though. "What type 
of rifle?"</p>

<p>"M1A's in 7.62 NATO, the civilian version of the M14 
battle rifle, five 20 round magazines each, with Leatherwood ART scopes 
and mounts suitable for firing at Camp Perry matches." The Irishman looked puzzled. Ah, thought the American. "That's Bisley matches to you. High power rifle competition."</p>

<p>Sean McGrory nodded his comprehension.</p>

<p>"Plus,
let me think," the American paused, "ah, 3200 rounds of M-118 special 
ball match ammunition, in boxes not stripper clips. That's sixteen cans 
at 200 rounds per can, four cans to a wire-bound wooden crate, plus 
another crate of 800 rounds of AP. That's five crates total. I have five
rifles and that will give you 800 rounds per rifle. Ought to be plenty 
to get them sighted in and operational. I'll throw in some repair parts 
and springs , not a lot but enough. Cleaning kits. I don't have a stock 
of binoculars or spotting scopes, but I can give you a list of makes and
models that will work best with the rifles. You can get them at 
sporting goods stores anywhere in the States. Surely you've got some 
locals who can pick them up without drawing suspicion?"</p>

<p>The Provo nodded. This was truly better than he had hoped.</p>

<p>"How much and when can I take delivery?"</p>

<p>The
American told him. It was cheap at twice the price asked, and he could
get them headed to Mexico in three days. That gave him plenty of time 
to check out a contact that had been given him in Texas. The Texan was 
supposed to have Barrett M82 fifty caliber sniping rifles for sale. If 
the new smuggling scheme held up, there would be a bumper crop of 
One-Shot Paddys in South Armagh in three months or so. It was so good a 
deal, that he decided to sweeten the pot.</p>

<p>"I'll give ye a thousand dollar bonus on the deal if ye can have them to me in 48 hours."</p>

<p>The
American grinned. "Sure, it'll just go the lawyers anyway. Every little
bit helps." He looked up to see the barmaid headed their way. "You got 
the tip?"</p>

<p>"Sure as the mornin'."</p>

<p>"OK, I'm going to the 
john and then out the back door. You've got my contact number. Call it 
tomorrow and confirm the cash, and I'll get you a rendezvous, which then
will get you an escort to the pickup point. You come personally, with 
only one other friend. Remember, I'm not going to screw with you so 
don't you try to screw with me. I don't want to piss off the IRA, but I 
won't be hijacked either. OK?"</p>

<p>Sean McGrory, which wasn't his 
real name, grinned. "Up the Republic!" he toasted as he held up what was
left of his Guiness &amp; Bushmills "Gelign ite cocktail."</p>

<p>"Hell, yes," agreed the American, "Up yours and up mine!" The Irishman laughed, and kept laughing.</p>

<p>I
guess he did get the double entendre, thought the American. And without
another word, he walked to the rear of the bar. When he hit the john 
door, somebody was puking out his Irish whiskey -- probably a Jamesons' 
drinker -- so he kept on going out the back, the thick-armed bouncer 
nodding goodnight.</p>

<p>When he hit the street, he sucked in the 
fresh, bitter cold air. God, he wanted a cigarette. What a time to 
quit. So he glanced about, and then did what he always did these days 
when the urge came on him. He took a pen from his pocket and stuck it in
his mouth, gripping it in his teeth. A nicotine baby pacifier, he 
snorted to himself. Then, seeing no one, he cut down the alley, stepped 
over a drunk by the dumpster and made it to his car a block and a half 
away. No one followed him.</p>

<p>Kraut Mueller started his beat up 
Pontiac station wagon and pointed it toward his new home-away-from-home,
a roach infested apartment in the University district. His 
soon-to-be-ex-wife, he knew, was asleep in the arms of her 
newly-discovered "soul mate" in the place Kraut had paid for -- and was 
likely to continue paying for -- for some time. He no longer cared about
that. He did care deeply about his six-year-old son who was sleeping in
the room next to theirs.</p>

<p>As he drove, he pondered the tactical lessons imparted by the Provo gun runner while he hummed "One-Shot Paddy."</p>

<p>The three hundred meter war.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<h4>"A decided ballistic advantage": Ten years later, on a ranch near Denton, Texas. </h4>

<p>Kraut
Mueller looked over at the label to the right and slightly above his 
head on the OD canvas wall. "Tent, General Purpose, Medium." Then he 
scanned the men seated informally on folding chairs and cots scattered 
about. Most wore BDU woodland camo, some were the same uniforms they had
worn on active duty. Kraut had never been in the military and he felt 
decidedly at a a disadvantage. He wasn't a veteran. Yeah, he'd been shot
at. People had tried to kill him. But he had never been a soldier in 
the service of his country as most of these men had been. His camouflage
was jeans and a plaid shirt.</p>

<p>No, he had not been a soldier. He 
HAD been a traitor to his country during the same war that some of these
men were veterans of. He had been, he knew, a traitor to THEM, not that
he was going to brag about it here. He had been a communist and an 
urban guerrilla in the making before Dr. Richter had saved him from that
insanity. And even after he had recovered from his "Benedict Arnold 
period" as he called it, he had been a two bit gun runner for a while. 
Battle rifles to the Provos, M-2 carbines to the marijuanos. Playing 
with rearming hand grenades and selling them to Mexican pot growers as 
booby-traps -- the transactions always made on THIS side of the border 
in the desert outside Tucson where his cousin tended bar. It was good 
money but stupid stuff, while his young son grew and his marriage had 
eroded around him. But that was all many years B.C. now.</p>

<p>Before Clinton.</p>

<p>But
perhaps because he was unconventional in his experience, he could see 
essential things that the others, steeped in the by-the-book of military
experience apparently did not. The question was, could he get it across
to them? Could he make a difference? The truth was that the enormity
of the responsibility they had undertaken was beyond any of their 
experiences. What they were grasping at without really knowing how, was 
to recreate citizens' militias in their individual states in a fashion 
that was practical, do-able on slim resources and yet would be 
recognizable to the Founders, and most importantly, EFFECTIVE. What they
were about was fashioning a credible deterrent to the Clintonistas, and
in doing so they were trying to build a brick wall with little straw 
and not much mud. They were trying, in fact, to rebuild the Founders' 
concept of armed civic republicanism after more than a century of 
disuse.</p>

<p>Hell, what we're talking about doing here in practical 
terms is forcing the federal government to back down, to desist from 
further depredations of life and liberty. And after Ruby Ridge and Waco,
everybody understood the costs of failure. They were undertaking, in 
public, to... how was it that somebody had put it?... yeah, that's
it, to "shake their guns in the tyrant's face."</p>

<p>Well, when you 
do that, you had better be a credible deterent. Because if you aren't, 
the tyrant just stomps you dead and goes about his business. So what 
constituted deterrence?</p>

<p>Numbers, yes.</p>

<p>Nobody knew what 
they were exactly, but the press accounts made it pretty plain there 
were hundreds of thousands of us, at least, maybe a million, maybe 
millions. Let there be millions, Kraut silently prayed. What was it 
Clausewitz had said? "In military affairs, quanitity has a quality all 
its own." Well, we are no longer that fabled "nation of riflemen," but 
we are a nation with riflemen. Count the deerhunters, William Jefferson 
Clinton. Count them and tremble. Numbers we got. But numbers weren't 
everything. Sometimes numbers weren't anything at all.</p>

<p>Deterrence
was also made credible by resources, logistics, by the capability of 
the weapons wielded, and the ability to sustain them in the field -- 
ammo, fuel, even beans and rice.</p>

<p>Kraut was no soldier, nor even 
an ex-soldier, but he was a student of military history, logistics and 
weapons. And we're mighty thin on all of those. No air cover, no 
artillery, no armor, no integral supporting heavy infantry weapons -- no
mortars, machine guns, hand grenades -- all those things that the 
veterans had taken for grant ed when fighting as part of the greatest 
army with the largest logistical tail and technological prowess of any 
ever seen. All of which were forbidden to them as citizens by law or 
else closely restricted.</p>

<p>When he had raised these concerns 
earlier in the day someone had countered, "If we fight, we fight as 
guerrillas and we won't need all those things. We'll live off the 
weapons and supplies we sieze."</p>

<p>"You're presupposing," Kraut had shot back, "that we have the ability to seize anything."</p>

<p>There
were men and women who were attracted to the constitutional militia 
movement who did worry about logistics, at least, but many were infected
with the survivalism bug. They had stocked up beans and bullets in 
out-of-the-way places, worried as much about societal collapse as 
government tyranny. But running and hiding at the first shot was not a 
plan for victory, Kraut knew. He tried to tell such folks as he came 
across, people who were making preparations but were too frightened to 
train openly -- too afraid of exposing the existence of their carefully 
hoarded caches to engage in the business end of civic republicanism -- 
that they would merely end up doling out their precious supplies to 
those who did. Join, train, grow stronger by association and the power 
and example of numbers, he had urged them. Then your logistical 
preparations can be defended. Maybe, they won't even be necessary.</p>

<p>His
words, he knew, had fallen on mostly deaf ears. Some people, he had 
found, not only took counsel of their fears, they hid BEHIND their 
fears.</p>

<p>OK, so you worked with what you had. So what do we have? We have millions of rifles and we have will.</p>

<p>Will.</p>

<p>Will
-- which flowed from the combination of the natural anger at bad 
governmental behavior and the fear that it could happen to all of us. 
Outrage. Yes, we have that to burn. But that was a fickle thing, Kraut 
knew. Evanescent. A candle burning brightly but subject to the guttering
puff of the first strong wind.</p>

<p>In the end, will was a by-product
not only of belief but of military ability -- of competence at the 
business end of resistance -- and of that they had... not so much. 
Almost none, in fact. Which was why these men were gathered here in this
tent, at one of the first national meetings of militia leaders in the 
country. These were not, for the most part, the posturers and the speech
makers, the "militia generals" and conspiracy loons. Those were at the
meeting aplenty, to be sure. But they were, at the moment, outside 
this guarded tent in the middle of the encampment, speechifying and 
comparing Trilateralist and Bilderberger notes in heated conversations, 
selling videotapes and Spotlight subscriptions to one another.</p>

<p>These
men, on the other hand, were the unit builders, the trainers, here to 
hash out the doctrine, strategy and tactics of armed civic republicanism
in the last decade of the bloody 20th century, at a time when 99 
percent of their fellow citizens could not have told you what that 
phrase meant. These were the serious men, the practical men, and for 
every one of them, there were a hundred likeminded leaders scattered 
across the country who would pay attention to what was said here. Folks 
who would read what was posted on the Internet about it, sift it 
according to their own experience, judge it, discuss it with their 
people and internalize what made sense in their own field training 
exercises and practice.</p>

<p>"'Well regulated' means standardized," 
one of the men from Michigan was saying. "We all ought to adopt a common
rifle and caliber." He was immediately interrupted from three sides.</p>

<p>"According to whose standard?"</p>

<p>"All my guys are poor volunteers, some of them don't even have deer rifles, just shotguns."</p>

<p>"No, he's right, we ought to standardize on ARs and 5.56 like the military."</p>

<p>"Just about every guy I've got has a different weapon. How do I make them upgrade?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"
challenged someone else, "Who's going to buy them? Uncle Sugar ain't 
going to reimburse you the thousand dollars it takes to find an AR these
days. And he's not going to buy your ammo either."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Wolverine, "then make it SKS's, AK's and the common caliber of 7.62x39. Everybody can afford an SKS."</p>

<p>Half
of the men groaned or rolled their eyes. Separate arguments broke out 
over the eternal gunnie question of 5.56mm versus 7.62x39. AR's were 
more accurate, AK's were more reliable. What did you want? It was like 
the old beer commercial. Great taste or less filling? And then there was
the corollary dispute, .45 vs. 9mm. And, as if to suggest they didn't 
have enough to argue about, somebody else brought that up at that moment
too. There were many passionate opinions and no compromise was 
possible. Noise filled the tent.</p>

<p>"GUYS!" a big booming voice cut 
through the chatter. They all turned toward the big bald headed guy from
New Mexico. "We're here to hammer out a common plan. Arguing about 
caliber is a waste of time because we'll never agree. Let's get back to 
what we CAN agree on. And you," pointing at the guy who had brought up 
the merits of .45 vs. 9mm, "I can answer that question."</p>

<p>Squirming at the attention of every man in the tent, the guy from Kansas said, "Uh, OK, how?"</p>

<p>The big New Mexican grinned. "Because I've been shot with both and .45 hurts worse."</p>

<p>The tent exploded in laughter.</p>

<p>"That's right!"</p>

<p>"You tell him, Bob!"</p>

<p>Kraut
Mueller liked the New Mexican. He had a command presence, a head on his
shoulders and little tolerance for horseshit and wishful thinking.</p>

<p>It
was decided that standardization, while desirable as a goal, would be 
left up to individual units to implement, or not, given their own 
resources. Of course, that was the way it was with just about everything
they discussed. Militiafolk were by nature irascible, independent and 
opinionated. Trying to get them to move in a common direction was like 
trying to herd cats and chickens at the same time. It could be done, but
the least you would get for your trouble was exhaustion and a migraine.</p>

<p>Kraut knew what he'd pick, if asked. When he spoke later with Bob and some of his guys, he told them.</p>

<p>"George
S. Patton said the M1 Rifle was the best battle implement ever devised,
but that was only because he died before they refined it into the M14. 
It is absolutely reliable, it is accurate with iron sights and it is 
hard-hitting. Most importantly, it outranges the standard weapons of our
likely antagonists, the federal police agencies. What are they armed 
with? ARs and MP5 submachineguns. The 5.56mm slightly outranges the 
7.62x39 in practical terms, so with an SKS or an AK you've got to get 
well inside his fire envelope before your fire begins to tell on him."</p>

<p>Kraut paused. He still had their attention, although a couple of foreheads were starting to wrinkle up in argument.</p>

<p>"I
met a guy one time who clued me in about trying to fight a superior 
force with weapons that had the same practical ranges as your enemies. 
He was a Provo IRA man over here on an arms buying mission and bought 
M1A's from me. He was real happy to get them. Why? Because the 7.62 NATO
outranges the 5.56 by a considerable distance and hits harder when it 
gets there at any range. And yeah, I know, long range target shooters 
are getting great results with heavy 5.56 bullets at long ranges, but 
they're only punching paper, not a man in helmet and body armor firing 
back at you." Kraut paused again. He could see the words of objection 
forming. Before they could speak, he continued.</p>

<p>"Sean taught me 
about two things. The Gelignite Cocktail, which is a double of Bushmills
dropped into a pint of Guinness Stout Ale," a couple of the militiamen 
laughed at that, "and the Three Hundred Meter War. If this comes to 
shooting, God forbid, it's those three hundred meters you've got to 
worry about. Nothing is more demoralizing than being harried and 
bloodied by an enemy you cannot touch. Somebody who shoots and scoots 
and is gone when you get to where he was. Now that doesn't mean you're 
not going to close with the enemy. You must. After you driven him to 
distraction and got him jumpy and going in ten directions at once then 
concentrate and STRIKE. But even then, what is the harm in carrying the 
fight to the enemy with a weapon that punches harder than his at any 
range? A weapon that will penetrate cover better than his. A weapon that
is more reliable than his."</p>

<p>"But the AK..." one of the men blurted out.</p>

<p>"Yeah,
I know the Kalashnikov is even more reliable than the M14. And it's 
cheaper, and ammo's cheaper and it's what most of us have got. That or 
an SKS. I own both. So do most of my guys back in Alabama. But we're 
still just getting together now, trying to get our heads around a 
problem that only reared its ugly head two years ago at Waco. And I'll 
concede the point that a man who knows how to go prone and shoot a $69 
SKS with iron sights at practical combat ranges is a greater asset to 
his unit than somebody with a $2,000 scope-sighted trophy who can't the 
broad side of a barn without a table and bench, doping the wind and a 
significant amount of prayer."</p>

<p>"Look," said Kraut, "have any of you read John Plaster's The Ultimate Sniper that came out a couple of years ago?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said a tall sandy-haired fellow from West Texas.</p>

<p>"OK, maybe you'll remember this. I carry it around in my wallet because I'm always having this argument."</p>

<p>As
he spoke, Mueller reached around, produced his wallet, slipped a much 
folded piece o f paper out of it and put his wallet back in his jeans' 
pocket. He began to read.</p>

<p>"A term cited repeatedly in this book 
is 'ballistic advantage,' the great benefit you have over potential 
opponents due to your .308's performance. I coined this term so snipers 
could clearly understand that at ranges beyond 400 yards, their rifles 
are inherently more accurate, more powerful, and more lethal than the 
assault rifles carried by their adversaries. At shorter ranges, an 
assault rifle's large magazine capacity and high rate of fire give an 
opponent the advantage. Therefore, think of yourself like a long-armed 
boxer who keeps his foes at arm's length, where you can pound him and 
exploit this great advantage. Equally, realize that allowing your foe to
come within close range brings mortal danger. Since this is an 
advantage inherent with the ballistics of these respective rounds, let's
examine those relationships exactly. Our first data box compares .308 
Federal Match bullet energy against the energy of Soviet Type PS 7.62mm 
123 grain and 5.45mm 53-grain rounds fired from an AKM assault rifle . .
. From the muzzle, the .308 has approximately two times the energy of 
its competi tors -- meaning it will strike with twice the force, 
penetrate media to about twice the depth, and so on. But as we go 
farther out, the advantage of the .308's heavier boat-tail bullet 
actually becomes even greater. By the time you're at 600 yards, it's 
hitting with about four times the force. To keep this in perspective, 
realize that the AKM rounds generate much less energy at 600 yards than a
mere 9mm does at the muzzle, which is about 350 foot pounds... Next 
consider the drift advantage you have when it comes to a 10 MPH 
crosswind, shown in the next box. Again, the advantage is immediate but 
becomes more profound with distance..."</p>

<p>Kraut paused to clear 
his scratchy throat. One of the New Mexicans handed him a canteen and he
up-ended it with a big swig, only to find it was full of Jameson's 
Irish Whiskey. He gagged, and whiskey came out his nose and ran down his
chin. Choking and sputtering, he gasped "Water!" and another canteen 
was handed him. This delighted Bob's boys, who leaped up to slam him on 
the back (which only made things worse) and to call out insults like, 
"What's the matter, Alabama, never had Irish whisky before?"</p>

<p>"I... I told you," he wheezed, "I'm a Bushmills man." Then he coughed 
again. "I never drink any alleged whiskey that comes out of a round 
bottle."</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Bushmills' Irish Whiskey, the nectar of the pagan gods of the Celts, comes in a square bottle.</p>

<p>Looking around through tearing eyes, he realized it had been a set-up. "You dirty bastards..."</p>

<p>"No, no," they demurred, denying culpability, laughing while trying to appear penitent at the same time. "Go on. Go on."</p>

<p>He looked at the folded xerox and his eyes still teared, unable to focus. Finally, he was able to. "Where was I? Oh, yeah."</p>

<p>"Again,
the advantage is immediate but becomes more profound with distance...
By the time the AKM 7.62 round has traveled 400 yards, it has blown 
fully two body lengths off target. Imagine your foe 'guesstimating' when
firing 500 or more yards into the wind or shooting against a stiffer 
crosswind. A round's bullet path tracks its descent from the instant it 
exits a muzzle aimed parallel to the earth and indicates the amount a
shooter must hold high when firing at longer distances. Here the 
advantage over a 7.62x39mm is obvious, but the higher velocity 5.45x39mm
maintains a trajectory comparable to the .308 Match round."</p>

<p>Kraut paused again, taking another drink of water and verifying it before swallowing.</p>

<p>"Our
final comparison is velocity, and here the long-distance .308 advantage
clearly shows, despite the initial superiority of the 5.45x39 bullet. 
Because the heavier better maintains momentum, it overtakes the 5.45 
bullet at 400 yards and by 600 yards it's decisively superior to either 
AKM. Now let's combine these ballistic effects. The .308 Match bullet 
strikes with considerably more energy, an advantage that increases with 
distance; it shoots truer and straighter in a crosswind; it is much 
flatter shooting than the 7.62x39, and approximately similar to the 
5.45x39mm; and the .308 considerably exceeds these rounds' velocity 
beyond 400 yards. Overall this is a decided ballistic advantage."</p>

<p>Kraut
looked up from the paper and handed it the man on his right. "Look at 
the charts," he said, "Plaster's not wrong. And the 5.56 isn't much 
better than the Kalashnikov rounds."</p>

<p>"Hell," said one, "everybody wants to be a goddam sniper just so they can get out of training. It's a damn disease."</p>

<p>Kraut
looked over at the man, and nodded. "I know what you're saying. I've 
seen it too. But I'm not talking about making more snipers, I'm talking 
about making more capable riflemen. I know we can't get there today or 
even tomorrow. What I'm talking about is the future. We need to recreate
Dan Morgan's body of riflemen, with aimed, disciplined semi-automatic 
fire. Rifles carried by trained, physically fit men who know what to do.
Unless I miss my bet, the threat of that is what keeps our opposite 
numbers in the bowels of the Hoover Building pacing the floor at night. 
And the M14 series semi-auto is the best tool that is available to us."</p>

<p>"Plus," Kraut added with a smile, "its a marvelous platform for launching rifle grenades."</p>

<p>"Rifle grenades?!?" blurted one of the men. "Who's got rifle grenades?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied Kraut calmly. And before anybody could object, he continued.</p>

<p>"Of
course, they're inert training grenades. All perfectly legal, but great
to train with. And if there ever should need to be real grenades, don't
you think that in a nation of machine shops with a chemical industry 
second to none that we couldn't accomplish THAT? The important thing is 
to get your practice time in before if, as and when. Try hitting a 
55-gallon barrel with a pound and a half projectile at 300 meters 
sometime. It's kick-ass fun."</p>

<p>"Tell us more about the rifle 
grenades," said one. Kraut grinned inwardly. Well, whatever worked. And 
if the guy you were trying to sell the serviceable used car to was more 
interested in the chrome, well, wasn't it the best chrome you had ever 
seen?</p>

<p>"OK," agreed Kraut amiably. "The launching of rifle 
grenades from an M14 series rifle requires a special grenade blank 
cartridge, a USGI flash suppressor with bayonet lug and an M76 grenade 
launching attachment..."</p>

<h4>The Quarry: Six months after The Battle of Sipsey Street</h4>

<p>The
first group of Alabama State Defense Force trainees sat on rude wooden 
benches in the open, arranged in an arc in front of a small raised 
platform, following the natural contour lines of the punchbowl that was 
this end of the quarry's principal feature. With the olive drab canopy 
over it, it looked like nothing so much as a GI roadside fruit stand. 
The ex-gunnery sergeant of Marines waited while the acting sergeants 
hushed their squads. Behind him was a free standing bulletin board with a
large graphic training aid showing the major assemblies and exploded 
view of a military rifle.</p>

<p>"All right. My name is Sergeant Major 
Hafnir. I am the lead marksmanship instructor here. And this," he said, 
gesturing to the training aid illustration, "is why you're here."</p>

<p>"The
U.S. Rifle 7.62 mm M14 is a rotating bolt, gas operated, air cooled, 
magazine fed, shoulder fired weapon. It is 44.14&quot; long and weighs 8.7 
pounds. With a loaded20magazine and sling it weighs 11.0 pounds. It's 
maximum effective range without accurizing and using iron sights is 460 
meters. That's 500 yards to you apes from Winston County. Adopted in 
1957, 1,380,358 M14 rifles were made from 1958 to 1965 by the U. S. Army
Springfield Armory, Winchester, Harrington &amp; Richardson Arms Co. 
and Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge, known fondly forever after to riflemen of 
all generations as TRW. Thanks to that incompetent swine Robert 
McNamara, the M14 was replaced as the standard arm of the U. S. Armed 
Forces by the Poodle Shooter, the Matty Mattel Toy, the ever-jamming, 
cursed M16, in the mid-1960s. After that, the U. S. Government sold the 
M14 rifle production machinery to Taiwan and they began making Type 57 
rifles in 1969."</p>

<p>"Today, there are fewer than 150,000 M14 rifles in
the U. S. military inventory, with many of those packed in cosmoline at
Anniston Army Depot here in Alabama. At least 450,000 M14s have been 
transferred to the foreign governments of Israel, Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania. Israel was given 35,000 M14 rifles by the U. S. Government in
1973 at the start of the Yom Kippur War. The Israelis built 10,000 
sniper rifles out of these and they remained in service until 1997. Some
of these have since returned to the United States for civilian sale. 
During the Clinton Administration..."</p>

<p>There were some boos and jeers from the crowd. Hafnir stopped. His face wore a killing look. The punchbowl got deathly silent.</p>

<p>"I'm
going to say this just once. The next GODDAM snot-nosed DUMBASS that 
interrupts this lecture is going to be carrying one of these rifles over
his head on a ten mile dead run around the camp until he pukes his 
asshole up for inspection. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"WHAT?"</p>

<p>"YES, SERGEANT!"</p>

<p>"All
right. During the Clinton Administration, three quarters of a million 
M14s were ground up by Presidential Executive Order, destroyed at 
Anniston for no other reason that I've ever heard except that they made 
the cowardly SOB nervous."</p>

<p>Nobody snickered.</p>

<p>"However, the
M14 rifle remained in use aboard U. S. Navy ships and in Navy SEAL 
Teams as well as with US Army Delta Forces. You may remember that Randy 
Shugart, who won a Congressional Medal of Honor for his conduct in 
Mogadishu in October 1991 carried an accurized M14. With the advent of 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the M14 was brought back as a 
Designated Marksman weapon and has given great service, with its added 
range and hitting power a definite plus. Even so, some problems were 
experienced with Checkmate production mags and there was also the 
difficulty of finding serviceable receivers among the few M14s that 
Slick Willy had left us in the inventory."</p>

<p>The morning breeze whipped a fine grit into the eyes of the assembled trainees. The tarp over the platform flapped slightly.</p>

<p>"As produced, the M14 was capable of both semi-automatic and full automatic
fire, with a selector lock that only the unit armorer could free up by 
means of a special tool. There was a later attempt to make a BAR out of 
the M14 and the M14E2 was given a straight line stock, pistol grip, 
forward hand grip and bipod. However, because it lacked the BAR's weight
it was not as stable and effective as an automatic rifle, although it 
did have firepower. Does anyone here know what the classic definition of
firepower is, as applied to infantry rifles?"</p>

<p>"More misses per minute, Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"Right. Heard me before, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"Anyway,
what the M14 excels at, what it does superbly in the hands of a 
rifleman trained to its use, is aimed semi-automatic fire. Now some of 
you have the notion that you're going to be big, bad snipers. Most of 
you have as much chance of becoming a sniper as you do of getting laid 
in the middle of Governor Marsh's Sunday School class at First Baptist."</p>

<p>One
kid from St. Clair County -- and only one -- laughed out loud at that 
and blurted "God damn!". Hafnir didn't say a word, but you could hear 
his eyeballs click as he looked at Staff Sergeant Bowles who was 
standing on the sidelines closest to the poor unfortunate. In an instant
Bowles was in front of the trembling kid.</p>

<p>"Name?" Bowles said it softly, but with a deadly import. It would have been more humane to have screamed at him.</p>

<p>"C-c-cartwright, Sergeant." The boy badly wanted to piss his pants.</p>

<p>"Rise
and come to parade rest when I talk to you." There was something 
disembodied about Bowles' voice, like the sibbilant computer-generated 
hiss of a mechanical snake.</p>

<p>Cartwright leaped to his feet, rigid. At attention.</p>

<p>"I said, at 'parade rest.' I'm an NCO not an officer. Are you hard of hearing, Cartwright?"</p>

<p>"N-no, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Then you heard what the Sergeant Major said?"</p>

<p>How somebody could sound so reasonable and yet so frightening all at the same time was a mystery to the trainees who heard him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant," said the miserable Cartwright.</p>

<p>"Follow me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Bowles marched off with the condemned man in tow and was soon lost to view. No one dared to turned to watch him go.</p>

<p>Hafnir cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Right.
Don't get me wrong, snipers have their place on the modern battlefield.
But that place is in support of RIFLEMEN, executing the integrated 
battle plan of the unit commander. They are not freebooting pirates 
wandering around the battlefield plundering souls at their own whim. 
THEY support YOU, the rifleman. And that is what we are going to do in 
the next week. We are going to make riflemen of you. You will be taught 
how to use the rifle in defense of yourself, your unit, your family and 
your state. You will be taught marksmanship and maintenance. You will be
taught the use of the bayonet and of the rifle grenade. I will teach 
you, and not God nor Ray Marsh will help you if you fail. Understood?"</p>

<p>"YES, SERGEANT!"</p>

<p>"We'll see."</p>

<p>Hafnir
turned to the table beside him and picked up a rifle, racking the bolt 
back, where it locked in place with a clack on the empty magazine. He 
faced front and hefted it at port arms.</p>

<p>"All right, this is the 
Taiwanese Type 57 Rifle, an almost exact clone of the US M14 Rifle. 
Through a magical process which your brains are far too primitive to 
comprehend, the State of Alabama has acquired a number of these for the 
maintenance of public order during the present emergency. This little 
darling and all her sisters come to us straight from the Combined 
Services Arsenal at Kaohsuing. When you successfully complete your 
training here, each of you will carry one home with you, along with a 
new M1956-style H-harness and belt, three magazine pouches, a canteen, 
cup and cover, a bayonet and scabbard, seven 20 round magazines and a 
basic load of M80 ball ammunition. If, at the end of the week, you are 
selected as a Designated Marksman, you will return for another training 
rotation and will then be issued M118 Special Ball ammunition instead of
M80.</p>

<p>Per state law, as interpreted by the Attorney General and 
supplemented by certain executive orders of Governor Marsh, the Alabama 
State Defense Force has been remodeled along the lines of the Swiss 
system."</p>

<p>Those watching marveled that the rifle moved not a millimeter while Hafnir spoke.</p>

<p>"You
will note that the rifle issued you has been restamped at the new ASDF 
arsenal at Montgomery with 'M14SA' and 'Alabama'. The first was done to 
reduce confusion among us old timers who have never called this 
beautiful rifle anything but an M14. The 'SA' stands for semi-automatic 
as all of these rifles have been so modified.</p>

<p>The second was done
to remind you that this rifle is the property of the State of Alabama. 
It is not yours. It is not to be used for ANY PRIVATE PURPOSE 
WHATSOEVER. It will stay in your gunsafe or closet until it, and you, 
are called out by the state, for further training or active service. You
will be responsible for this rifle, and woe betide you if you lose it. 
You will wish you had never been born, and at the very least I can 
assure you that whatever your ultimate fate, you will do that wishing in
jail. Understood?"</p>

<p>"YES, SERGEANT!"</p>

<p>"Those of you who are
familiar with the M14/M1A series of rifles will no doubt also note 
there are two significant changes to these rifles which were made at the
arsenal. These are a Sadlak tactical magazine release latch, here," he 
pointed, "and a Smith Enterprises extended bolt stop/release, here." He 
turned the rifle about to point at a piece on the left of the receiver. 
"Taken together, this modification saves seconds on magazine changes. 
And seconds count in combat. Believe me."</p>

<p>Hafnir returned the rifle to the table.</p>

<p>"A
few words about the bayonet and the rifle grenade launcher. Every 
generation since the invention of gunpowder has thought that the bayonet
-- the infantryman's spear of last resort -- would become as obsolete 
as Achilles' shield. It never has. Do you know why? Because the rifleman
is forever being called upon to 'restore order.' Sometimes that means 
just showing our serious intentions without shooting some poor asshole 
as an example to the rest. Fixing bayonets allows us to announce our 
intentions. It also allows us to keep disarmed prisoners moving to the 
rear, or crowds of civilians in line at a disaster recovery center. 
Because merely showing it is not always enough to prevent its use, you 
will be taught how to use it in combat. The M14 is an excellent bayonet 
platform, unlike Mr. McNamara's Mouse Gun which can break in a heartbeat
if you buttstroke someone with it.</p>

<p>Now, because we don't want 
you to have to get that close, we also teach you the art of the grenade 
launcher. And it is an art. Among other things, we teach you the 
grenade launcher because it may be necessary to project tear gas 
grenades for crowd control."</p>

<p>If anybody had any questions about "among other things," they weren't going to risk Cartwright's fate to find out.</p>

<p>"After
training, one in four of you -- those who demonstrate aptitude -- will 
be chosen as designated grenadiers and you will be issued an M76 type 
grenade launching attachment along with your rifle. You will also be 
responsible for this piece of issue equipment. Grenade blanks and any 
pyrotechnic grenades or other munitions will be issued to you at times 
of unit muster, if required. In the meantime you keep that attachment 
with the rifle at all times. Understood?"</p>

<p>"YES, SERGEANT!"</p>

<p>"All right, I guess we'll find out whether Alabama still grows sons capable 
of being riflemen. Acting sergeants, form your training squads by number
and line up to draw equipment. After the equipment is received, you 
will sign for it. You in-bred rednecks from Walker County can make an 
'X' if you need to. You will then form up and your acting sergeants will
inspect you and insure that each of his men has everything and it is in
working order. After that, you will report back here to the seats you 
now occupy for the next bloc of instruction."</p>

<p>Hafnir's eyes scanned the crowd.</p>

<p>"MOVE!"</p>

<p>"YES, SERGEANT!"</p>

<p>As they stood and turned to form up, in the distance Cartwright's form 
could be barely seen, already faltering, as Bowles jogged easily beside 
him. No one wanted to join them, so no one said a word.</p>

<h4>Voltaire and God's will: After Sundown, Instructor Barracks, The Quarry.</h4>

<p>"Hey, Schultz," called former Gunnery Sergeant Hafnir, "bring me another beer while you're over there."</p>

<p>"On
the way," replied Sergeant 'Schultz,' whose real name was Schwartz. 
Hafnir had been calling him 'Sergeant Schultz' for more than seven years
now, but Schwartz didn't mind. Everybody had to have a nickname and 
there were worse ones than being called a character from an old sitcom.</p>

<p>The instructor cadre was gathered around a table in the common area, boots up, winding down after a good first day.</p>

<p>"Did
you think we'd ever be drilling newbies again in the fine art of the 
M14 rifle?" Bowles asked, addressed to no one in particular. There were 
murmured grunts and agreeable nods. They all wore a half-smile on their 
faces. God, they had missed this. The camaraderie, the sense of purpose,
the mission.</p>

<p>Winkler replied, to God as much as Bowles, "I just hope I don't lose my federal pension over this."</p>

<p>Hafnir
countered, a little more roughly than he actually felt for the sake of 
the others, "What're you worried about? At least you got a good-lookin' 
young wife who can earn her livin' on her back. Look at poor Bowles 
there. His wife left him years ago and he couldn't get Barney Frank to 
pay him for a blowjob."</p>

<p>They all broke out in laughter, even 
Bowles. Even Winkler. He'd only known Hafnir for four years and the 
older Gunny had been ragging him for three and a half of those about 
Marie. Winkler was lucky and he knew it, so he didn't mind. Hafnir's 
wife had died of cancer the year before and there had been a time when 
his friends had feared that one morning they'd wake to the news that the
ex-Marine had eaten his .45. Not now, though. Now Hafnir, like them, 
once again had a purpose in life.</p>

<p>Then Hafnir asked, "How's Cartwright, Bowles?"</p>

<p>"He'll
be all right. I didn't grind him too bad." (That meant that he was 
sleeping in his own cot tonight and not in the infirmary.)</p>

<p>"That 
boy musta had three breakfasts and a midnight snack. He may be stupid 
and out of shape, but he's got grit. Kept tryin' to keep goin'."</p>

<p>"Hell," Winkler offered, "they're all stupid and out of shape."</p>

<p>"Naw,
they're not," piped up Jemison. Unlike most of the other trainers, who 
had been scout-snipers or marksmanship instructors for the Corps, 
Jemison was all Army and had been a Designated Marksman in Iraq and 
Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division. At the moment, he was sunk 
so deep in the shadows of a beat up recliner in the corner that you 
could barely see him from the table. Like a sniper in his hide.</p>

<p>"Pay
attention to a little kid named Flynn. He's a natural, and he's got a 
common-sense mind that's as quick as a snake. He's attentive, he's 
patient and he's a tough little monkey. On the evenin' run I'm settin' 
the pace and they're all draggin', but Flynn's just matchin' me stride 
for stride and my legs have got to be six inches longer than his. So, I 
look over at him and he gives me this grin and a wink. And I just busted
out laughin'. Couldn't help myself."</p>

<p>"Maybe he wanted a date, Jemison," said Bowles with a leer in his voice.</p>

<p>"Mebbe,"
said Jemison agreeably, "but he was the first man in his class to 
successfully field strip and reassemble his rifle. I walked over to him 
and accused him of doing that before, expecting that he had an M1A or a 
Polytech M14S at home. The boy got insulted, I could tell. He says, 'No,
Sergeant, I just paid attention to what you showed us.' He did too. 
When I was demonstrating the technique he just sat stock still, taking 
it all in. Turns out the only military style weapon he's ever owned is a
Rumanian AK74."</p>

<p>"An idiot savant," sneered Bowles, adding, "Forrest Gump lives."</p>

<p>"No,
I noticed that kid too," said Winkler. "I was going over sight picture,
ballistics and the incremental sight setting adjustments between M80 
Ball and M118 Special Ball, and he held up his hand and said, 'Sergeant,
if the M80's bullet is lighter and travels faster, won't it hit higher 
on a target than an M118?' Worked that out by himself just looking at 
the ballistic tables on the wall. I asked him if he'd ever reloaded or 
done any match shooting and he told me no, but that he liked the peep 
sight of the M14 over his AK74 because it was easier to adjust and had a
longer sight radius so that meant it would be more accurate."</p>

<p>"So he reads Guns and Ammo AND Shotgun News." Bowles was still skeptical, but then skepticism was his default mode.</p>

<p>"Bowles," said Jemison, "you're one deeply flawed human being."</p>

<p>Bowles lifted his beer bottle in a mocking toast. "I'll drink to that."</p>

<p>The TA312 field telephone on the wall clacked. Hafnir reached a long arm over and snagged the handset out of the cradle.</p>

<p>"Instructor Quarters, Hafnir."</p>

<p>He listened for a moment.</p>

<p>"Right. Send them down."</p>

<p>He replaced the handset.</p>

<p>"Company coming. Jack Durer and one friend."</p>

<p>"Shall we clear the decks, Gunny?" asked Bowles, thinking of the beer bottles.</p>

<p>"Naw, it's just Jack. He probably wants to find out how we did today. Relax."</p>

<p>They
hadn't seen Durer since the day in the Governor's office in Montgomery 
when the state's chief executive had hired them for the job of training a
modernized ASDF.</p>

<p>Hafnir paused, then added, "And Bowles?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Gunny?"</p>

<p>"Don't try that snake-scary voice on Jack Durer. He'll feed you your larynx."</p>

<p>As
they walked down the path leading to the Instructor Quarters with the 
bare illumination of the smuggler's moon guiding their steps, Jack 
Durer's friend looked up at the night sky. It was beautiful here, deep 
in the Alabama piney woods, with barely a light in the camp apart from 
the main gate at this time of night. Lights out for trainees in the 
Alabama State Defense Force meant lights out as it did in any other 
army, and even if it wasn't as yet much of an army -- or really, even an
army at all -- the stars still blazed forth in all their glory.</p>

<p>Jack Durer caught his friend's upward glances. "Pretty, is it not?" he asked in Mandarin.</p>

<p>The
friend sighed, and spoke slowly, carefully, in barely accented English,
"Yes, but not so beautiful as the stars of a home I shall never see 
again."</p>

<p>"They're the same stars, my friend. Besides, you'll go back one day."</p>

<p>"No,
I think not. The world as we knew it is falling apart, Jack. It is as 
Yeats said. 'The center cannot hold.' We always knew that we lived at 
the mouth of the dragon's cave. The wonder is that it took so long for 
the dragon to come out and devour us. Of course, it did not help that 
the biggest dragonslayer decided to lay down and take a nap." He paused,
reflecting bitterly on the many disasters that the election of the 
current President of the United States had generated so far away from 
America.</p>

<p>There was nothing Jack Durer could say to that. We're 
guilty, he thought. Guilty as charged. May God and history forgive us. 
Not that either was likely.</p>

<p>"No, this is my family's new home. My
descendants will be Americans." He paused. "Or maybe just Alabamians. 
Our fates are now intertwined, you and I."</p>

<p>"They always were, my friend," said Jack softly. "They always were."</p>

<p>Hafnir,
his ears dulled by years of small arms fire on the ranges of the United
States Marine Corps, didn't hear the two men approaching. Schwartz did.
He moved to the window and glanced out, catching the profile of the two
men in the illumination of the porch light. "Gunny, he's got Chao-yeh 
with him."</p>

<p>Hafnir came to his feet instantly. They all did. "Schultzy, get the door."</p>

<p>As
Schwartz held the door, General Chen Chao-yeh, formerly Deputy Chief of
the General Staff of the Army of the Republic of China, also known as 
Taiwan, entered, followed by Jack Durer, who was toting a gun case. 
Chao-yeh was impeccably dressed in a Saville Row suit, appropriate for a
Washington embassy reception.</p>

<p>The first and last time any of the
instructors had seen the General was in the news footage when he was 
coming down the ladder of his personal jet at Birmingham International 
Airport along with his wife and extended family. There on the tarmac, he
had claimed political asylum and eloquently denounced both the forced 
takeover of his country by the Communists and the cowardly political 
expediency of the United States in allowing it to happen. The rumor was
that the Type 57 rifles were his doing.</p>

<p>Forget the clothes, 
thought Schwartz, you could spot him as a life-long military man from a 
thousand meters. There was not a spare ounce of fat on the small man, as
far as he could see. Schwartz and the rest of the training cadre came 
to attention unconsciously. The General noticed.</p>

<p>"At ease, 
gentlemen. We are not here on official business, and as you know I no 
longer command anything, having been stripped of my rank and property by
the transition puppet government of my country. Or, I should say, the 
country of my birth. This," he gestured around the room and to the woods
beyond, "is my new home. As to rank, well, perhaps my new country will 
find use for me again one day."</p>

<p>The men remained standing, respectful, expectant.</p>

<p>"I'd
say it already has," replied Jack Durer, setting down the gun case and 
moving forward to make introductions. "General, this is Oliver Wendell 
Holmes Hafnir, retired Gunnery Sergeant of US Marines, currently serving
as chief instructor of the Alabama State Defense Force with the rank of
Sergeant Major."</p>

<p>The General extended his hand to the big 
ex-Marine. "I am very pleased to meet you, Sergeant Major Hafnir. I hope
you like the scrap metal I have been pleased to provide you."</p>

<p>"Scrap metal, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the Type 57 rifles. You see they were declared surplus to our needs as 
the so-called Reunification Summit was getting underway and I arranged 
to buy them as scrap metal before the puppet administration could take 
over. I bought many things that way. Everything in my former country is 
for sale or theft these days, and I am afraid that when the Communists 
finally take us over, they will find only the bones of the chicken left.
It will make a poor meal for them, I think." The General smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"I am fortunate that my family has money derived from our long-time 
shipping interests. This provided not only the cash to buy the scrap 
metal, but the ship to transport it as well as many of my friends and 
family retainers to the Port of Mobile, where I arranged to sell the 
cargo to your Governor, also as scrap at low prices. I am pleased that 
he has found a use for it. As for my fellow expatriates, your Governor 
has extended a welcoming hand to all of them. Perhaps one day someone 
will find a use for them as well. Perhaps," and here the General paused 
briefly, "perhaps that too will involve scrap metal."</p>

<p>"General," 
said Hafnir as he smiled broadly, "I can assure you that yours is the 
FINEST lot of scrap metal that any of us have EVER seen." The 
instructors arrayed behind the Gunny nodded as one. Jack Durer almost 
laughed out loud.</p>

<p>Instead he said, "Gunny, why don't you make the
introductions all 'round, while I open up this steamer trunk." As the 
instructors and the General were introduced, Jack Durer lifted the rifle
case to the table. Breaking away from the group around Chen Chao-yeh, 
Bowles swept the beer bottles, empty and not-so-empty, off the table and
into a trash can. He began to mop the table with a frayed bar towel 
when Jack Durer ordered, "Forget it Sergeant Bowles, I think the General
and I have seen more than a few empty beer bottles in our time."</p>

<p>The
introductions were done, and courtesies preserved, when Jack Durer 
opened the case. To the men standing around the table, what lay inside 
was sleek, deadly and more beautiful and alluring than a naked woman.</p>

<p>The
General cleared his throat and addressed Hafnir. "Sergeant Major, 
although we have never met, my friend Captain Durer has informed me of 
your service to our country and our state."</p>

<p>'CAPTAIN' Durer? thought Hafnir.</p>

<p>The
General continued. "In recognition of this, I present to you an example
of the craftmanship of the old Republic of China, a T93 Sniper Weapon 
System in 7.62 NATO caliber. As you will no doubt notice, it was 
patterned after your own M24 rifle. It is capable of Point 3 MOA at 800 
meters. I am pleased to recall that in my younger years I had a small 
part in the design and testing of this weapon when I worked overseeing 
certain programs at the 205th Combined Services Arsenal at Kaohsuing. I 
have taken the liberty of having the stock replaced to more properly fit
American ergonomics, so this example has a greater length of pull than 
does the production version. I think you will find the fit satisfactory.
Please, Sergeant Major, do try it."</p>

<p>Hafnir lifted the weapon 
from the case. It WAS beautiful, and it fitted his shoulder like a 
well-worn glove. Inletted into the stock was a small plate, subdued in 
color but easily readable. "Presented to Sergeant Major O.W.H. Hafnir by
Chen Chao-yeh." Below that was the date, and below the date was this 
sentiment: "God is on the side of the best shots."</p>

<p>"Voltaire, sir?" Hafnir was lucky. It was the only quote from Voltaire he knew.</p>

<p>"Yes,
Sergeant Major, Voltaire. But I must confess that I have wondered from 
time to time how Voltaire, who was an agnostic and a libertine and well 
versed in the intricacies of sin as are most Frenchmen even today, could
have undertaken to enunciate the will of God. Still, for riflemen such 
as ourselves, it is comforting to believe it to be true, do you not 
think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, General, I do." What a beautiful killing machine, he thought. "I cannot thank you enough."</p>

<p>"Oh,
perhaps one day you will be able to return the favor. I myself am a 
Christian, but I also believe in the concept of karma. Karma, duty, 
fate. They are all intertwined. Let us all do our duty and perhaps 
karma will be sufficient unto the day thereof."</p>

<p>The General 
paused and looked around the room. "I have also arranged with Captain 
Durer that each of the rest of you, as well as Sergeant Major Hafnir, 
will recieve a new Type 57 of your own. These are for your personal use,
please understand, not the property of the State of Alabama and you may
take them with you when you leave state service. They should arrive in 
two or three days." The General looked at Durer, who nodded. The 
instructors stirred, impressed and pleased.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I will 
take my leave now so that you can get some rest and begin your tasks 
tomorrow with a fresh perspective. I thank you for allowing me to 
intrude upon your personal time."</p>

<p>As they left, Durer said to Hafnir, "I'll call you tomorrow, Ollie."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>When they were gone, Bowles turned to Winkler and asked, "What the hell is karma?"</p>

<p>Winkler grinned and said, "Bowles, you don't know shit from shinola. Don't you watch TV?" Bowles looked at him blankly.</p>

<p>"'My Name is Earl'?"</p>

<p>"It is?"</p>

<p>"The TV show, idiot."</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh." Bowles didn't watch commercial television.</p>

<p>Winkler
explained. "Karma, my ignorant friend, is the mystical Asian 
philosophical concept that states that what goes around, comes around."</p>

<p>"Oh, shit," said Bowles.</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Winkler.</p>

<p>For
his part, Oliver Wendell Holmes Hafnir, whose initials O.W.H. were 
widely believed to stand for "Old War Horse," was left wondering just 
what in hell all that had been about. We've just started training these 
kids. You can't even say we'll succeed, according to whatever parameters
Jack Durer and the Governor judged to be success. It ain't like we just
took Mount Suribachi all over again.</p>

<p>So why in hell did an expatriate Taiwanese general just drop a custom rifle that was worth at least five grand on him?</p>

<p>Karma?</p>

<p>Karma,
hell. The General, or more likely Jack Durer, wanted something from 
him. The question was, what? And would it cost him more than the rifle 
was worth?</p>

<p>Former Gunnery Sergeant Hafnir had a sneaking suspicion that it would. But, damn, wasn't it beautiful?</p>

<p>As he mused, he caught a furtive movement out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"Bowles, get yer damn greasy, beer-drippin' hands off my nice new rifle."</p>

<h4>Inner Circle<br/>
Jack Durer's Living Room, Prattville, Alabama<br/>
Three weeks after the Winston County Massacre</h4>

<p>The
Adjutant General of the State of Alabama was unhappy. He didn't like 
the informal place of this meeting, he didn't like Jack Durer and he 
didn't like the way events were pushing him.</p>

<p>He was painfully 
aware that he was a man very much in the middle. He'd had a long 
conversation two nights ago with the Secretary of Defense of the United 
States, a conversation he wasn't about to mention to the Governor. The 
SecDef had made it plain -- the Adjutant General had sworn his first 
oath to the United States, not to the state of Alabama -- and that in a 
federal system, it was the nation which came first. Something else was 
made plain to him -- his Army pension was on the line if he didn't play 
ball with Washington. Ray Marsh was a long-time friend and 
philosophically the Adjutant General was right there with the Governor.</p>

<p>But not if he had to work as a greeter at WalMart to pay the bills.</p>

<p>This
morning, he had met with the FBI man who had been designated as his 
contact and had passed over documents detailing what he knew about the 
shipment of Taiwanese arms now sitting, he thought, at the Mobile Docks.
God, how many federal laws would be broken if Ray Marsh got involved in
that?</p>

<p>He looked up from the coffee table at his feet to see Jack
Durer standing across the room, murmuring to Billy Mitchell. Only Durer
wasn't looking at the Director of the Department of Public Safety as he
spoke, he was looking at... me, the Adjutant General realized with a
start. And at that moment, Jack Durer did something even more 
unsettling.</p>

<p>He winked.</p>

<p>The SOB just winked at me. What's that bastard up to now?</p>

<p>The Governor came in from the sewing room, where he had been on his knees praying for guidance.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen,
thank you all for coming. I apologize for the setting, but it was vital
that these conversations remain confidential, and my official offices 
in Montgomery are now all wired for sound by the federal authorities. So
are my private residences, in both Montgomery and at home."</p>

<p>The 
Governor nodded at the Attorney General, who was sitting on the other 
end of the couch from the Adjutant General, "Robert has advised me to 
leave them in place, as has Jack Durer, each for their own arcane 
reasons. As we said before, please keep this in mind when calling or 
visiting me."</p>

<p>Ray Marsh's attention fixed on the Adjutant 
General. "General Baxter, would you start us out by giving us your 
report on the various National Guard elements and how they would react 
to being federalized?"</p>

<p>This was the topic he had been told was 
the subject of this meeting. He didn't believe it. The earth was moving 
under their feet -- the federal avalanche was coming -- and Ray Marsh 
was too convinced of his own God's divine assistance and perfect 
judgment to back off. No, they were all accomplished and intelligent 
men. They knew, as did Baxter, that the Democrat Lieutenant Governor's 
wife was already measuring the Governor's Mansion in her mind for new 
curtains. The smart money of Montgomery's Old Guard of both parties was 
betting against Ray Marsh being in office much longer. But these men did
not look hunted, or beaten. They were up to something. He'd bet his 
pension on it. Then he realized, I already have.</p>

<p>"In a word, 
sir," Baxter replied, "if they are federalized, they will obey. Some 
will stay home. Some will drag their boots. But they will obey."</p>

<p>"I
see," said the Governor absently, his mind obviously on something else.
"And the State Defense Force? How would you rate their readiness?"</p>

<p>Baxter
was astounded at the stupidity of the question. He also commanded the 
ASDF but it was hardly more than a coffee-drinkers' club for old 
veterans who needed an excuse to spend drill nights and occasional 
weekends away from their spouses.</p>

<p>"Sir, the present operational 
readiness of the Alabama State Defense Force is zero point zero." He 
paused, then a thought occurred to him, "Surely, sir, you are not 
intending to oppose the federalized Alabama National Guard, or even 
federal police agencies, with the ASDF? That would be insanity. Insanity
and the ultimate exercise in futility. Good men would be killed, to no 
purpose."</p>

<p>Surely not, Baxter thought. Surely.</p>

<p>"No, that coincides with my opinion, as well," replied the Governor.</p>

<p>Baxter relaxed, which was, given the circumstances, entirely premature.</p>

<p>"General
Baxter, I would like your resignation before you leave here this 
morning. It will take effect in 90 days. You have plainly failed in your
duty, required by Alabama law, to provide this state with a trained and
competent state defense force."</p>

<p>"What?!?" Baxter blurted out.</p>

<p>"I
would have thought what I said was simple and direct. There are, 
however, a couple of other... special circumstances... that you will 
be required to fufill before you leave office. Colonel Mitchell and Mr. 
Durer will explain those to you as you leave."</p>

<p>"If you think you can get away with this..."</p>

<p>"I'm
sorry General, I already have. Billy and Jack will explain to you why 
it is in your own best interests for you to comply and leave your 
position quietly."</p>

<p>Huh? thought Baxter dully through his anger.</p>

<p>"This
way, General," said Jack Durer, motioning toward himself with his index
finger like a patiently indulgent parent calling a three-year old over 
to him. Baxter was also aware of one of the Governor's protective 
detail, brought into the room as Ray Marsh had pronounced the end of the
General's career. He now stood quietly but ominously behind the couch, 
in case Baxter decided to make a scene.</p>

<p>He did not. He was a 
Major General of the United States Army National Guard, by God, and he 
would leave as he had lived. With honor, dignity and under his own 
power. He stood to attention, and though it was not called for, he put 
his cover on his head, faced the Governor and saluted. Then, and only 
then, did he allow himself to follow Jack Durer and Billy Mitchell from 
the room. The bodyguard followed.</p>

<p>They passed through the house 
and then out into the breezeway and the garage beyond. There, in one of 
the bays, was a table. Upon it was a file folder, some pens and a tape 
recorder. Arrayed around it were three folding chairs.</p>

<p>"Have a seat, General," invited Billy Mitchell.</p>

<p>"I think not," Baxter said icily. "I'm leaving."</p>

<p>"Going
where, General? Back to your wife at home or to the arms of your 
'comfort woman' Lieutenant Hansen at Headquarters?" Jack Durer asked 
brutally.</p>

<p>Baxter spun on his heel. "It that what this is about? Blackmail?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Have a seat," said Mitchell, almost gently, "and we'll tell you what this is about."</p>

<p>Baxter sat.</p>

<p>"That'll be all, Phil," Billy Mitchell said to the bodyguard, who vanished at his boss' command.</p>

<p>"Look, you two..." began Baxter.</p>

<p>"Shut
up, General," ordered Durer. "For once in your life, shut your big fat 
mouth and listen. We're willin' to make you a deal. Listen to the deal, 
and then make up your mind."</p>

<p>Billy Mitchell opened, "First, 
General, let's talk about what we know about you and your recent 
activities." He pushed the play button on the tape recorder. It was 
Baxter's own voice talking to the Secretary of Defense of the United 
States and promising, among other things, to do whatever the SecDef 
wanted to help get rid of Ray Marsh as Governor of the State of Alabama.</p>

<p>Baxter was astounded. "How," he began.</p>

<p>Jack
Durer smiled. "Yeah, I know. How did we know to tap that phone, when we
couldn't have known which one you would use? How were we able to record
and untwist an encrypted conversation? Life is full of questions, 
General. But let me tell you this, the questions of life are not half as
important to you personally right now as the ANSWERS. It doesn't matter
HOW we got this tape. What matters is what we DO with it."</p>

<p>Billy
Mitchell, continued sympathetically. "Look, General, no matter how this
ends -- whether Ray Marsh is still governor or not -- if this tape ever
gets out you'll be the biggest traitor of all time in some folks' eyes:
bigger than Benedict Arnold and right up there with Judas Iscariot. 
You'll be known as the feller who threw in his lot with the people who 
sent those cop-killin' Brightfire murderers among us. There's relatives 
of dead men in Winston County who'll track you down and kill you for 
that alone. You'll have to leave the state -- your lifelong home -- for 
your own safety, and you'll NEVER be able to come back. You see that, 
don't you? So hear us out. Show him what else we have on him, Jack. 
Don't leave him hanging."</p>

<p>When Durer finished ten minutes later, 
Baxter realized that his federal pension meant nothing. These bastards 
had him by the short and curlies. They even knew about the expense 
account skimming. If they want, they can throw me in jail right now, my 
life and reputation ruined forever.</p>

<p>"Here's the deal," said Durer
when he finished. "No matter what you want, when you walk out of this 
room without your job -- and you will whether you sign the papers or not
-- the federals won't do a thing for you. You're of no use to them 
without your position, and that you do not have. And one other thing. If
you're bettin' on that moron of a Lieutenant Governor gettin' Ray 
Marsh's job anytime soon so he can get you your own job back, I 
wouldn't. Look at your file. What kind of file do you think I've been 
able to compile on that corrupt shithead? Don't bet on him, you'll lose.
Bet on us. It's safer."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" asked Baxter in defeat.</p>

<p>And so they told him.</p>

<p>When
Jack Durer and Billy Mitchell returned to the living room, they found 
the new acting Adjutant General of Alabama chatting with the Governor 
and the Attorney General.</p>

<p>"Billy," asked the Governor, "have you met General Wilson before?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't had the pleasure, but of course Jack's had a lot of good things to say about him."</p>

<p>As
the two men shook hands, Wilson said, "You know, I've often wondered if
there was anybody in the state of Alabama that Jack Durer DOESN'T 
know."</p>

<p>They all looked at the older man. "Well," Jack admitted begrudgingly, "maybe two or three."</p>

<p>The Governor brought them back to business. "Is General Baxter going to play ball by our rules?"</p>

<p>Billy
Mitchell spoke first. "Why, Governor, after Jack here got done showing 
the General satellite photos of the birthmark on his penis from three 
different angles, he was quite agreeable."</p>

<p>"A birthmark on his penis?" the Attorney General asked.</p>

<p>"Metaphorically speaking, sir. Merely metaphorically speaking," said Billy.</p>

<p>Jack Durer just grinned.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Governor, "that's a relief."</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>"All
right," the Governor said, "back to the issues at hand. I won't bore 
you, or embarrass General Wilson, by singing his praises in detail. 
Suffice it to say that he's Alabama's most decorated Marine officer, and
I am told that the only reason he didn't make Commandant of the Corps 
before he retired was that he is absolutely incapable of kissing any 
politician's butt, in or out of uniform, and that includes my own. Hal 
shares our vision of the Founders' Republic, he is incorruptible and in 
any case he's independently wealthy so he can't be bought by a threat to
his pension, like poor Baxter there. More importantly, as much as I 
hate to admit it being an Army veteran, the Marines are the best at 
training light infantrymen, and that's the job he'll have -- getting the
ASDF up to snuff in a hurry."</p>

<p>Jack Durer couldn't resist. "Well, I'm glad you didn't praise him, boss," he said with his trademark grin.</p>

<p>The
Governor gave that just a thin smile in return. "General, in the 
interest of bringing you up to speed on my 'commander's intent,' as it 
were, let me recap the task we have before us. In order to give Robert's
legal plan a chance to work, we have to buy time. At the same time we 
must prepare for any eventuality, including what happens if our 
brilliant maneuvering fails."</p>

<p>"It seems plain that our first job is
to keep order. That means no more Sipsey Streets and no more Winston 
County Massacres. Billy is spending most of ABI's time keeping track of 
the federal agents in Alabama. Jack is working the 
intelligence/counter-intelligence end of things with both outside help 
from his friends across the world and some of Billy's very best men. We 
must also keep the hotheads of our own people, the militias and so on, 
from taking it upon themselves to attack the Federals in retribution."</p>

<p>"Now,
there is nothing we can do outside of the boundaries of this state, and
it would seem that other states, especially the "blue" areas for lack 
of a better term, are going to experience a rising tide of violence from
their own frustrated people as the laws are tightened on them. For our 
part, Alabama MUST be an island of stability in a stormy sea. I cannot 
emphasize that enough. We MUST remain at peace as long as possible. And 
if the break finally does come, it must be the administration that is 
plainly seen by all as the aggressor. Are you with me so far?"</p>

<p>They all nodded, knowing how difficult that would be.</p>

<p>And there was more. Much more.</p>

<p>The Governor took a sip of water from the glass on the sideboard next to his chair.</p>

<p>"Now,
to a certain extent, this is going to work in our favor. Here's Alabama
trying to arrive at a legal solution to the attacks upon her citizens 
while other more liberal states are engaged in an escalating spiral of 
violence. But in the end, the administration in Washington is finally 
going to recognize that, because of our political legitimacy, Alabama is
the greater threat to them. They will not want to concede our main 
point, which is that if the republic is to be preserved intact, the 
states must return to a time when they had much more autonomy."</p>

<p>"Robert
has been in contact with his counterparts in many other states, mostly 
in the south and mountain west. They are willing to join us in certain 
legal maneuvers, but not others. And no one else is in the position that
we are to push this as far as we can. Alabama will lead the way, 
gentlemen, along a tough and lonely road, so there must be no errors, no
miscalculations. And anytime you think that I'm headed in the wrong 
direction on any particular point, I want to hear it. But let one thing 
be perfectly clear. There will be no more innocent Alabama citizens 
victimized by this federal administration or their mercenary toadies 
while I am Governor. If we hear of a raid coming down, we will maneuver 
whatever forces we have on the spot to get in between the feds and their
intended victims. Are we all clear on that?"</p>

<p>They all nodded assent. The General said it out loud, "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And if, God forbid, we arrive too late to get in between them and their 
prey, I want us on the Feds' backs so tightly that they will think twice
of burning any churches down with babies in them to cover their 
mistakes. I admit that this increases rather than decreases the 
likelihood of violent confrontation between federal forces and our own. 
But I am not going to stand by idly again while the feds kill our 
citizens. I am the duly elected governor of Alabama and not some federal
errand boy who gets told about things after the fact like the Sipsey 
Street business."</p>

<p>"So, the first thing we must do is keep order 
with the slim resources we have. The second thing is to build up the 
peacekeeping strength of the state to meet future challenges."</p>

<p>"Robert believes, and I concur, that there is enough statutory authority for us
to dramatically expand the Alabama State Defense Force into a 
Swiss-style militia system. From the ferment in the state that these 
federal attacks have generated, as well as threat of further oppressive 
laws in the works, we do not lack for volunteers to our cause. Nor, with
the addition of General Wilson do we lack in our ability to train light
infantrymen. What we lack are resources."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, General 
Chen Chao-yeh has come to our rescue with a boatload of Type 57 rifles, a
million rounds of 7.62 NATO ball ammunition and various and sundry 
other goodies from Taiwanese arsenals. The General offered to sell these
to the state and I accepted," and here he glanced over at the Attorney 
General with a smile, "without benefit of expert legal advice. Now 
Robert tells me we are on firmer ground by seizing them as we would with
any other firearms found in the hands of those without legal right to 
possess them. As in the case of a machine gun seized from a dope dealer 
by a local police department, we are within rights to simply put them in
safe storage and later, if we choose, to use them for lawful training. I
have informed the departments of State and Customs as well as the ATF, 
that the General's arms were seized at the dock by the state. Robert has
duly investigated the matter," and here he gave the Attorney General a 
wink, "and discovered that since Chen Chao-yeh declared them when the 
boat docked and made no attempt to smuggle them in contrary to law, he 
is blameless of any violation of law and therefore will not be 
prosecuted by the state."</p>

<p>General Wilson spoke up, "Governor, a 
million rounds SOUNDS like a lot of ammunition but it really isn't, not 
when we have to burn up a LOT in marksmanship training. But sir, exactly
how many Type 57 rifles did the General bring?"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand."</p>

<p>General Harold Allen Wilson let out a low whistle. "Well, that's a good start."</p>

<p>Jack Durer interjected, "There were some other goodies on the Hai Tong you'll want to see, Hal."</p>

<p>"Were?" asked the General.</p>

<p>"Yeah,"
said Billy Mitchell, "we've got all of it secured in a warehouse in 
Montgomery under 24 hour guard by state troopers. Already caught two 
feds trying to sneak in to see what's there."</p>

<p>"What did you do to them?" asked the General.</p>

<p>Ray Marsh and Robert Williams just smiled. They knew the story already.</p>

<p>"Well,"
said Mitchell, "the troopers didn't think their FBI badges were real, 
you know, so they disarmed 'em and had Montgomery PD book 'em on 
attempted breaking and entering of state property. Mug shots, the whole 
nine yards. They couldn't deny the burglar tools they were carryin'. So 
anyway, we held 'em in the drunk tank until we had to give 'em their 
phone call, see? Then their boss comes tear-assin' down from Birmingham 
to personally identify 'em and so we apologize very sweetly and 
sincerely and let them go forth to sin no more. But not before some of 
Jack's brighter proteges had a chance to download everything from their 
cell phones and laptops and go through their car. Interesting stuff in 
there, wasn't there Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, those boys sure don't 
understand the concept of operational security, they surely don't. 
They're so used to doin' stuff to other folks they never considered it 
could be done to them. Poor unfortunate lambs. Our federal tax dollars 
surely don't buy what they used to."</p>

<p>The General laughed. Once again it was the Governor who brought them back on track.</p>

<p>"So,
Hal, we have the volunteers, the rifles, and enough ammunition to start
training. My office has some discretionary funds we can use to fund the
start-up. Robert here has had a brilliant idea of how we might tap off 
some of the cash the state budget receives from the off-shore oil 
revenues for the future, and we'll explore that. But it strikes me that 
we'll need a place to train, someplace out-of-the-way. Any ideas, 
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Jack Durer spoke first.</p>

<p>"Sir, there's an old 
rock quarry over in Bibb County which is just about perfect. Limited 
access, way, way out in the boonies. The state seized it for back taxes 
after the company that ran it went belly up, so we own it. We offered it
back out on the market for sale, but nobody's even sniffed at the 
place. It's huge, with plenty of trainin' area, if you don't mind rocks.
Plenty of space for a thousand meter rifle range. And any wayward shots
are not goin' to escape the high walls and land on some poor innocent 
farmer's wife hangin' out the laundry. Some of the buildings are still 
standin', though they'll have to be re-plumbed and rewired, maybe some 
roof work done. It's served by a railroad spur that's still in good 
shape. It's also located more or less centrally in the state and that's a
consideration since these trainees will be unpaid volunteers comin' 
from all over."</p>

<p>"What about housing for the trainees?" asked the AG, "is there enough room in the buildings for them?"</p>

<p>Jack began, "No..."</p>

<p>"Tents,"
General Wilson interjected. "We'll put 'em in tents. That's one thing I
happen to know that the Adjutant General's office can lay its hands on 
in abundance. Tents, GP, Small, Medium and Large. Tents, sir, and 
folding cots, USGI. Of course if there is no place with soil in the 
bottom of that quarry, then we'll have to use special tent pegs suitable
for rock. It'll be more expensive, but they'll have the advantage of 
not being pulled out in a high wind, or by an atomic blast come to 
that."</p>

<p>"I don't think the administration is that mad at us, YET," observed the Governor dryly.</p>

<p>"What about feeding the volunteers while they're there?" asked the AG.</p>

<p>"Jack,"
asked Hal Wilson, "is there a building there that could serve as a food
preparation facility? Not a big chow hall, but just a kitchen area with
water and electricity."</p>

<p>"Yeah, there is," responded Durer. "It 
was the old employee lunch room. Of course it's been stripped of the 
wiring and the plumbing, but it'll serve once repaired. You can put the 
trainees outside under tarps, I guess."</p>

<p>"Jack, I've lived most of my life under flapping green canvas and look what it's done for me," replied Hal Wilson with a smile.</p>

<p>The
Governor once again took control. "So, we have a place. General, have 
you given any thought to the training schedule? The cadre you'll need?"</p>

<p>"Yes,
sir," replied Wilson. "After Jack and I first spoke, I roughed out a 
training plan. I don't care how many of these trainees think they can 
shoot, I'd be surprised if one in ten really know how. So we start by 
getting their attention, then re-teaching them the basics. First show 
'em how on the 25 meter AQT and then have them apply that to shooting at
distances. The ones who show aptitude will be brought back for another 
rotation of advanced marksmanship training. Time is of the essence, so I
propose to start out big and get bigger after we prove the concept. 
We'll start with a group of 500 and make basic riflemen of them in one 
week. It's a tall order, but I believe with the right instructor cadre 
we can get it done."</p>

<p>"And who would that cadre be and where would you get them?" asked the Governor.</p>

<p>"Sir,
Alabama is chock full of ex-Marines. I'll start with a friend of mine 
who's forgotten more about marksmanship instruction than I'll ever 
know."</p>

<p>Jack Durer asked, "Old War Horse?"</p>

<p>"Right," replied Wilson.</p>

<p>"Old War Horse?" asked the Governor.</p>

<p>"Yes,
sir. Gunnery Sergeant Oliver Wendell Holmes Hafnir, USMC, Retired. They
call him Old War Horse. Just about every Marine has a nickname, 
Governor, and those who don't aren't worth knowing. Hafnir is worth 
knowing. Plus, he has all sorts of retired Marines for friends who he 
can tap as subordinates. Men who know the subject almost as well as he 
does. Men he trusts from having served with them over thirty years.</p>

<p>I
mentioned to him that I might have a chance to train some new recruits 
in the art of the M14 rifle and that he might, just might, have a chance
to help out. He smiled so broadly I thought his weather-beaten face was
going to crack. I couldn't keep him out of this deal now if I tried. 
He's the perfect man for the job. Of course, Hafnir and his cadre will 
not do this for free, sir. They'll expect to paid for it. We can hire 
them as state employees, sir, or treat them as independent contractors."</p>

<p>"Talk with Gunnery Sergeant Hafnir and sound him out on which alternative he would prefer, would you General?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"As soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'll sound him out right after I leave this meeting."</p>

<p>"Face-to-face, General, no phones or email."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All
right, General. Let's proceed to discuss how we deal with the National 
Guard and the threat of federalization. I understand both you and Jack 
have some ideas on how we might frame the question to the detriment of 
the National Command Authority."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we do."</p>

<p>"Governor," the AG interrupted, "before we move on, I have to ask General Wilson one question."</p>

<p>Harold Allen Wilson turned to face the AG, "Yes, Attorney General Williams?"</p>

<p>"What's your nickname, General Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Mine, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, General, yours. What do they call you behind your back?"</p>

<p>"'Hard Ass', sir."</p>

<p>Jack Durer and Billy Mitchell both snickered.</p>

<p>The Governor tried to hide his smile with a hand, but failed.</p>

<p>"Well,
General," the Governor said, "I'm told they call me 'Preacher Marsh' 
and the AG here is called my 'Deacon Williams.' There is substantial 
truth in a nickname, I fear. However, in the present emergency, a "hard 
ass" as Adjutant General is exactly what I need. Now, let's talk about 
how you're going to deal with the National Guard problem during the next
90 days when you'll be using General Baxter as a ventriloquist's hand 
puppet to carry out my orders."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."

<hr/>

<p>General
Wilson had already left to pay a call on ex-Gunnery Sergeant Hafnir, 
and the rest of the meeting was just about wrapped up. Apart unforeseen 
problems, The Quarry would be open for business in two to three weeks. 
Jack Durer, however, had one more topic to discuss.</p>

<p>"Governor, 
there is one other concern that Billy and I have and that revolves 
around our dear political friend, the Lieutenant Governor."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Sir,
as you know he's as crooked as a dog's hind leg and we can make that 
case in court any time you want. The problem is that if we take him out 
of the equation now, maybe the administration will start to look at 
other, worse options more closely. We're playin' for time, and I 
understand that. Keepin' the Lieutenant Governor on the board helps that
along, but..."</p>

<p>"But, what, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Sir, if you die, if
you are assassinated, the Lieutenant Governor would come to power 
before we could cause trouble for him. Without you, the other side wins.
Everything. We could not recover from your loss. And if I know that, 
someone on their side will see it, too."</p>

<p>"I see," said the 
Governor carefully, having already had some thoughts along these lines 
every night recently before prayers. "And your conclusion?"</p>

<p>"Sir,
I don't have a conclusion. Not yet. How we handle the Lieutenant 
Governor is, sir, above my pay grade as they say. But I just wanted to 
say that we should beef up your security detail, is all. With men that 
we can trust. This could get very rough."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ray 
Marsh. "Billy, give me some suggestions on how you would do that and 
I'll see if I can live with it." He paused. "Gentlemen, this is all in 
God's Hands anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," they said together. The AG nodded his head in silence.</p>

<p>"Billy,
get me that security plan. Jack, get The Quarry up and running. Robert,
I'll see you tomorrow at the secure office to go over the Interposition
strategy again." Then, he left the room, followed by his security 
detail.</p>

<p>Jack Durer shook his head. "It's all in God's Hands," he repeated.</p>

<p>"You know," said Robert Williams, Jr., "that reminds me of an old story my daddy used to tell me."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Billy Mitchell.</p>

<p>"Well,
there was this A.M.E. preacher back around the turn of the last 
century, and he was always saying to the congregation, 'The Lord will 
provide! The Lord will provide!' It didn't matter what the problem was, 
the preacher's answer was always, 'the Lord will provide!' Well, one 
night after services, the preacher decided to go home through the 
thickest part of the woods, instead of following the road, even though 
he'd been warned that there was a big, ornery bear in there. But he was 
in a hurry to get home to his wife's blueberry pie, so he cut through 
the woods anyway. Sure enough, he gets right in the thickest part, and 
this bear rears up and charges him. Well, my daddy said that the 
preacher didn't have time to run and there wasn't a suitable tree he 
could climb close by, so the preacher and the bear commence to going at 
each, the preacher swinging a big branch he found on the ground and the 
bear swinging his big bear claws. So the preacher fought what my daddy 
called 'a delaying action' all the way out to the other side. And the 
parishioners, they can hear this terrible ruckus and the preacher 
shouting out, 'the Lord will provide! The Lord will provide!' So 
somebody ran for a shotgun, just as the preacher and the bear burst from
the woods. The gun went off and the bear turned and ran, leaving the 
preacher standing there, bloody from a hundred cuts and slashes, 
half-naked, his clothes torn to pieces and his dignity barely under 
cover. His chest is heaving and his eyes are rolling and some smart 
mouth says, 'What happened, preacher? Didn't the Lord provide?' And the 
preacher looks over at him and between gasps of breath, explains. 
'Brother Henry, the Lord provides ALL things, but I just discovered He 
AIN'T much good in a bear fight.'"</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>"So, Brother Billy," Robert Williams, Jr. concluded, "make it a GOOD security plan, lest the federal bear gets us all."</p>

<p>"Right," said Billy Mitchell.</p>

<p>They
left Jack Durer alone in his living room, with his thoughts. As he sat 
planning his next moves in the service of his state, he absently flipped
the Fifth Special Forces Group coin over and over in his hand.</p>

<p>It read what it always had read - <i>"De Oppresso Liber".</i>

<hr/>

<h4>Encrypted messages in the wind</h4>

<p>To Jack from Kraut Mueller:<i>Heard
about your Type 57s and the Governor's plan to reorganize the ASDF. 
Suggestion on the Type 57s -- they will be much more combat-effective if
you install Sadlak tactical magazine releases and Smith Enterprises 
extended bolt stop/releases. Shaves seconds off reload time.</i><span style="font-size:100%;"></p>

<p>To Kraut Mueller from Jack Durer: <i>Thanks for the tip on the rock quarry. We're going to use it. Don't expect it it to be called 'Camp Mueller", though."</i></p>

<p>To Jack from Will Shipman: <i>Our 
friend is mending well. I must talk to you face to face about a bequest
from my grandfather. Sorry, but details must wait. However, they ARE 
worth waiting for.</i></p>

<p>To General Wilson from Jack Durer: <i>Glad
you concur on the Type 57 modifications. It seems we will have to 
recreate an Alabama State Armory for weapons inspection and modification
at the very least. I also have just been informed of another small but 
significant arms stash which will be transferred to state control 
shortly. It is one hell of a story, too. More later. Where shall we set 
up the arsenal and who will head it?</i></p>

<p>From Governor Marsh to General Wilson: <i>Agree
to your suggestion of hiring General Chen Chao-yeh as Director of the 
new Alabama State Defense Force Arsenal. His prior experience at Arsenal
205 in Taiwan and his familiarity with all types of weapons, old and 
new, can only bode well. His English is excellent, which of course is a 
plus. Will the first batch of M14SA's for the training class be ready in
time?</i></p>

<p>From General Wilson to Jack Durer: <i>After
shipping us several hundred each of the Sadlak and SEI upgrade parts, 
both companies have now cut us off, claiming all future production has 
been purchased by the United States government. What now?</i></p>

<p>From Jack Durer to General Wilson: <i>My
sources confirm we are being squeezed by the Feds on the M14SA upgrade 
parts. General Chen is having engineering drawings made of both parts as
I write this and he has made tentative arrangements for their 
production. Alabama-made samples should begin arriving at the arsenal 
within 10 days.</i></p>

<p>From Governor Marsh to Jack Durer: <i>Have
gone over your inventory of the fabled Winston County boxcar. In a 
word, incredible. Obviously these weapons will be "seized" for state 
training use, but if the inventory were to become public it would be 
hard to explain to the public how we need Quad Fifties or 75mm 
recoilless rifles for "maintenance of public order." I don't want an 
"Antiaircraft Detachment" or an "Antitank Company" on the TO&amp;E of 
the ASDF. How about "Critical Area Security Detachments"?</i></p>

<p>From General Chen Chao-yeh, Director, Alabama State Defense Force Arsenal, to Jack Durer: <i>My
friend, we have finished unboxing, cleaning and inspecting all of the 
ordnance from Winston County. It is just as pristine and serviceable as 
when it was produced in 1944-1945. The explosive ammunition boxes -- 
grenades, mortar, and recoilless rifle 75mm -- have been sequestered in 
safe underground bunkers and samples will be tested in the near future 
at The Quarry between training rotations, so as not to raise any 
eyebrows (even friendly ones). I will advise you of the precise date we 
select, because I know you will want to be there.</i></p>

<p>From Jack Durer to Kraut Mueller: <i>Thanks
for all your help in recruiting the first classes for the ASDF 
marksmanship school. You know that if you weren't so damn radioactive, 
I'd find a place for you on the state roster. As we agreed the last time
we spoke, you may indeed have a role in producing "training munitions" 
for the ASDF. The Governor is not opposed in principle to the idea, 
although he is also very adamant about not tipping our hand at this 
stage. We will need to find several cutouts and some generic company to 
contract for your services, or perhaps, to just set you up independently
and let you produce under license to us. There is still the subject of 
the FBI surveillance of you, but perhaps that will abate in the near 
future. Cross your fingers that we make the evening news on THAT one.</i></p>

<p>From Jack Durer to Will Shipman: <i>Governor
sends his best regards and thanks you for your family's gift to our 
state. As you are not nearly so "notorious" as our mutual friend Kraut, 
the Governor wonders if you would like to accept command of the 
Minuteman Battalion of the ASDF. This is envisioned as a "quick reaction
force" for the state and would be assigned the best people and most 
capable equipment. It would mean coming on the state payroll, but as far
as the Governor is concerned your DD-214 more than qualifies you for 
the position, even if you never made commissioned officer. We can give 
you a competent XO and S-3 (the S-3 I have in mind is a West Pointer, 
three tours of Iraq and sharp as the edge of a Randall combat knife) to 
bridge that experience gap. Speaking of combat knives, I also envision a
job for our friend and am glad to hear that the doctor has cleared him 
to return to duty. We have new identity cards for him and a new name to 
boot. They are official of course. Hey, we're the state, we can do 
anything. PS: Ollie Hafnir says your man Jimmy Flynn aced both the basic
and designated marksmanship courses. Old War Horse says he's a hell of a
shot. Tell the boy 'well done' from me, and tell him I still might let 
him shoot my Thompson one day yet.</i></p>

<p>From General Chen Chao-yeh to Jack Durer: <i>Pursuant
to your inquiry of last week I have canvassed my fellow expatriates and
located thirteen men who fit your requirements. Most have served with 
the former Republic of China's Long-Range Amphibious Reconnaissance 
Commandos, including some who did insertions into the PRC. Two of them 
are experienced instructors of special warfare. Most of them understand 
or speak passable English. The two that do not are still the best at 
what they do, so I thought that competence in that area should trump any
language concerns. They can work on their English, and I have so 
ordered it. You should also know that we have finished arsenal 
rebuilding on the Type 36 .45 caliber submachine guns (our version of 
your M3A1) as well as the M60 medium machine guns which came in with the
Type 57 rifles. My compatriots are familiar with both types of weapon 
and are certainly able to instruct yours.</i></p>

<p>From Kraut Mueller to Jack Durer: <i>You
may recall my friend Dr. Tim Goldstein of UAB from back when we were 
working on that certain state senator's corruption case. Tim has 
recently been contacted by a professor of the Technion in Israel who is 
seeking to relocate his family away from what appears to be the 
approaching battle of Armageddon with the Iranians. He has many 
connections in the Israeli armed forces and arms producing 
establishment. We need to help this guy, because he can certainly help 
us. Make time to go see Tim ASAP. It's important.</i></p>

<h4>"RECKLESS"</h4>

<p>"FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE!"</p>

<p>"LOAD, ONE ROUND, HE!"</p>

<p>"ROUND UP!"</p>

<p>"CLEAR!"</p>

<p>"FIRE WHEN READY!"</p>

<p>"FIRING!"</p>

<p>"BOOM!"</p>

<p>The
recoilless rifle belched smoke and debris out the back, kicking up 
swirling clouds of rock dust. The observers, well to the side of the 
back blast, lost sight of the weapon and crew as the cloud billowed and 
eddied. The impact of the round a thousand meters downrange was 
anticlimactic by comparison. Unless, thought Jack Durer, you were down 
there getting shelled.</p>

<p>"Not a very stealthy weapon," observed Jack.</p>

<p>"No,"
conceded General Chen Chao-yeh, "it is old, some would say obsolete, 
but at the moment it is the largest piece of anti-armor artillery the 
state of Alabama owns. And they are good for training gunners until we 
obtain something bigger."</p>

<p>"Something bigger?" asked General Wilson.</p>

<p>"What's on your mind, my friend?" asked Durer.</p>

<p>"Let us watch the rest of the demonstration and then I will tell you," said the General.</p>

<p>"FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE!"</p>

<p>"LOAD, ONE ROUND, WILLY PETER!"</p>

<p>"ROUND UP!"</p>

<p>"CLEAR!"</p>

<p>"FIRE WHEN READY!"</p>

<p>"FIRING!"</p>

<p>"BOOM!"</p>

<p>Later,
as command party relaxed in the briefing room of the old quarry 
headquarters awaiting the next demonstration, General Chen explained.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen,
the recoilless rifle you saw demonstrated today was a 1945 production 
M20 of 75mm caliber. The total weapon weighs about 115 pounds. Its 
maximum range is 7000 yards. In it's day it could defeat a T-34 tank. 
Today, it is a popgun and even light armor would turn its blast. As 
originally designed, it was to be a man-packed crew served weapon, 
mounted on an M1917A1 machine gun tripod. Later, it was realized that it
could be very handily mounted on a Jeep. As the tanks grew bigger and 
more heavily armored as the Cold War progressed, the M20 recoilless 
rifle was up-sized to the 106mm M40A1. With greater capability came 
greater weight and the M40A1 rifle, mount, .50 caliber spotting rifle 
and sight weighed a total of 483 pounds."</p>

<p>"As you no doubt 
observed, the recoilless ammunition cartridge case is perforated. This 
permits expanding gases of ignited propellant powder to escape evenly 
into the enlarged reaction chamber. These gases exert equal pressure in 
all directions within the chamber. Pressure to the front against the 
sloping wall of the chamber equals the force to the rear against the 
closed portions of the breech. The remainder of the force exerted by the
gases causes a conventional weapon to recoil. In a recoilless rifle, 
the remaining gases are permitted to escape to the rear through openings
in the breech; therefore the rifle remains motionless when fired.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/Recoilless_Rifle.png" alt='Recoilless Rifle Diagram' width='320' height='317'/></p>

<p>"You must remember, as obsolete and old-fashioned as this looks to our eyes 
today, what an elegant solution it was at the time to a problem that was
centuries old. This is not a short-range rocket launcher or bazooka. 
This is a direct-fire artillery piece, with a maximum range in the M40A1
of 8,400 yards. When I first saw one at officer's school in the 
Republic of China, I was amazed at American ingenuity. I still am. The 
last iteration of the recoilless rifle in American service was the 
M40A2. I am told there are still a number of these still in storage at 
Anniston Army Depot along with approximately a quarter million rounds of
ammunition of all types, HEAT, HEP and anti-personnel 'beehive' rounds 
loaded with flechettes."</p>

<p>"In the 1990s, BOFORS developed a 3A 
HEAT-T antitank round which defeat the reactive armor of modern tanks 
and have a 90% first round hit capability using the Canadian CLASS laser
sight. The Israelis, I happen to know, developed an even better sight, 
doing away with the .50 caliber spotting rifle entirely. They have also 
developed a class of very hard-hitting, state of the art projectiles for
the 106mm, including thermobaric warheads for smashing reinforced 
concrete positions."</p>

<p>"Of course, you Americans are so profligate 
with your resources, you discarded the simple and effective recoilless 
rifle entirely for Dragon, TOW, Javelin and Hellfire precision-guided 
munitions. You put a few M40s in reserve stocks and gave the rest away 
to many countries including the Republic of China and Israel. We small, 
poor nations appreciated your wastefulness and were happy to use your 
cast-offs."</p>

<p>"But General..." Hal Wilson began to interrupt. Chen Chao-yeh held up his hand to cut him off.</p>

<p>"Here
is my point. The federal government, including their police and 
mercenary formations, have many, many armored vehicles at their 
disposal. Most of these are actually sitting right here in Alabama at 
Anniston Army Depot, which is the principal rebuild facility for the 
Strykers, Bradleys and even the Abrams tanks. It is not outside the 
realm of possibility that, should they decide to do so, they may use 
these to deliver an attack that we could not blunt because we lack all 
of the supporting weapons of a modern army. But with 106mm recoilless 
rifles mounted on jeeps, using the latest sight packages and 
state-of-the-art ammunition we could defend ourselves, how is it you put
Jack, 'On the cheap?'"</p>

<p>"When I was in Israel eighteen months 
ago, they demonstrated their upgraded 106mm recoilless rifles, mounted 
on the latest version of their Sufa vehicle -- the name means Storm in 
Hebrew -- but the recoilless rifle jeep version is called Davidka, 
'little David'. They build them under license from Chrysler and are 
based on the Jeep Wrangler design. They are fabricated in the Automotive
Industries Ltd. factory in upper Nazareth. I toured the factory on an 
official visit and while I was there they demonstrated the M240 106mm 
gun carrier version -- the 'Davidka.' General Wilson, have you ever 
fired an M40 recoilless rifle mounted on an American military jeep?"</p>

<p>"Yes, many times."</p>

<p>"And
do you recall the principal drawback of that combination, other than 
the fact that unlike an armored vehicle the operators are out in the 
open?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you have to stop and lay the gun perpendicular to 
the axis of the vehicle. You cannot fire directly forward over the 
hood."</p>

<p>"Precisely. General. However, the M240 Davidka CAN fire 
its recoilless rifle over the hood. You now can point the vehicle at 
your target and approach it, firing as you go."</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/recoilless-rifle-truck-vietnam.jpg" alt="Recoilless Rifle Truck in Vietnam" width='320' height='184'/></a>

<p>"Of
course it is far more accurate to stop before you fire, but I watched 
Israeli operators launch a four vehicle chevron attack on eight old 
captured tank hulls in hull defilade position and destroy every one with
single shots to the turrets. They are very light cavalry, but they are 
very fast and they work magnificently. If they are 'little Davids,' they
sling a very accurate and hard hitting stone. One more thing the 
Israelis told me. Their latest antitank ammunition for the 106mm rifle 
will penetrate the armor of an M1A2 Abrams. It is based on a Russian 
design that they stole, apparently. That is all I could learn."</p>

<p>"But where will we get the 106mm recoilless rifles? Taiwan?"</p>

<p>"Alas,
no. It is far too late for that. The PRC has my former home by the 
throat. I regret not picking some up as I left, but it didn't occur to 
me. I can provide you with experienced operators but not the weapons 
themselves."</p>

<p>"Where, then? I can tell you that the Governor will not permit me to go to Anniston and seize those in storage there."</p>

<p>"Why,
General, you may obtain them from another small democratic country 
recently abandoned by the current President of the United States to 
shift for itself -- Israel. Perhaps my friend Captain Durer would like 
to become the first Sufa dealer in the state of Alabama, with a sideline
in unauthorized armaments importation?"</p>

<p>"You know," said Jack Durer, "I might just do that."</p>

<p>"By the way Jack," asked General Wilson, "do you recall what the nickname of recoilless rifles is?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Durer.</p>

<p>"'Reckless rifles,'" said Hal Wilson. "Reckless."</p>

<p>"Well," said Durer, "I guess that fits."</p>

<h4>"Whispering Death"<br/>
The Quarry, later that afternoon...</h4>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/quad50.jpg" alt="Quad 50" width='400' height='254'/></p>

<p>The weather was closing in and promised misery.</p>

<p>Bob Tennant didn't care.</p>

<p>He was like a kid with a new toy, and DAMN - what a toy!</p>

<p>What a job. I LOVE it.</p>

<p>He
owed it all to Kraut Mueller, who provided him the introduction to Jack
Durer, who in turn got him the interview with Generals Wilson and Chen.
Then, presto, chango! No more machinist job working for morons who 
hadn't had a clue what that involved.</p>

<p>Oh, he still got to use his
machinist's skills for General Chen, but he also got to reach back into
the happiest days of his young life, when he was an Army ordnance man. 
Tennant had been one of the first employees of the new ASDF Arsenal, and
he'd stripped down, inspected, and been able to play with weapons he'd 
only dreamed of. Working at the Arsenal was like wandering through a 
museum of weapons history of the past seventy years, and being able to 
shoot the displays. He was constantly amazed at how much Chen Chao-yeh 
knew about all of them.</p>

<p>Take this M-51 Quad Fifty. When they'd 
got her and her sister in -- and Bob Tennant didn't know where they'd 
got 'em except for some overheard scraps of conversation about "the 
mine" -- the World War II electricals were badly corroded. The rest of 
the units were in mint condition, but they were deader than Kelsey's 
nuts without electricals.</p>

<p>The General had him tear most of it out
- solenoids, switches, wiring, the works - and sketched out on a piece 
of paper how they would rewire it, along with a bill of materials, some 
of it including manufacturers, specs and sometimes part numbers, all 
from memory! Pat McCracken, the electronics man at the arsenal, was 
astounded too. Skeptical when Bob had showed him the piece of paper, 
McCracken had quickly become a believer. Now McCracken stood to the 
rear, ready to repair anything that broke, not that anything would. But 
he, Bob Tennant, was in the gunner's seat in the armored tub, ready to 
deal death though four fifty caliber belt-fed barrels.</p>

<p>He 
elevated the guns to the maximum as a safety measure, and then tested 
the controls by swinging the piece through a full sweep and then back 
again. Stopping with the front of the Quad pointed downrange, he dropped
the barrels and aligned the sights on the derelict panel van that had 
been towed into place fifteen hundred meters away.</p>

<p>I <i>love</i> it. Make ready to receive scrap metal, boys.</p>

<p>General Chen's voice crackled in ears. "Verify range to target."</p>

<p>Tennant
shifted the index finger of his right hand, and hit the actuation 
switch of the ITT military-grade laser range finder, one of General 
Chen's modifications.</p>

<p>"One-Five-Zero-Four meters," he reported through his voice activated throat mic.</p>

<p>"Calculate ballistics and lay the piece," ordered Chen.</p>

<p>Shifting
his finger once more, he hit the ballistics computer switch, which took
the range, calculated the ballistics of the fifty caliber 
armor-piercing incendiary tracer rounds loaded in the big drums and 
showed an elevation on the display. Tennant raised the guns ever so 
slightly to match the data. Another display showed the actual elevation 
of the guns. The General had explained that this was the best they could
do with the resources they had, although he had expressed the wistful 
yearning to slave the guns directly into a targeting computer so that 
all the gunner would have to do is put the electronic crosshairs on the 
target and depress the triggers.</p>

<p>"Ready," he reported.</p>

<p>"Prepare to fire top guns."</p>

<p>"Roger."</p>

<p>This was going to be good.</p>

<p>"Fire," ordered Chen.</p>

<p>He
began with short bursts and could see through the optical sight that 
the van was beginning to shred. The noise was thunderous and he was 
grateful for the commo earmuffs.</p>

<p>Tracers sliced through the sheet
metal a kilometer and a half away. He had been dead on without 
adjustment. Boy, some World War II antiaircraft artilleryman would have 
given his left nut for General Chen's electronics!</p>

<p>"Cease fire top guns, prepare to fire bottom guns."</p>

<p>"Roger. Ready."</p>

<p>"Fire."</p>

<p>Tennant
let go with the bottom pair of fifties and he traversed 
infinitesimally, walking his fire toward the front of the panel van.</p>

<p>"Cease fire bottom guns. Prepare to fire all guns."</p>

<p>"Roger."</p>

<p>He took in a deep breath. "Ready."</p>

<p>Hold on to your dicks, boys.</p>

<p>"Fire all guns."</p>

<p>He
depressed both triggers at once. By prearrangement with General Chen, 
he would fire a few bursts and then hammer down until empty.</p>

<p>The 
air roared, the world shook, and the shock and vibration caused him to 
drift off target. He brought it back with his last burst, then hammered 
down.</p>

<p>It went on and on. The van blew up and pieces of it were still hitting the ground when the roaring stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>Out. End of the show.</p>

<p>Shit, that was incredible. Load me up, thought Tennant, give me something else to kill.</p>

<p>What was the line he had read in that book about the building of the atomic bomb?</p>

<p>"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."</p>

<p>That's exactly how Bob Tennant felt at that moment. Bloodthirsty and atavistic.</p>

<p>God bless you, Kraut Mueller.</p>

<p>What a rush.</p>

<p>General Chen brought him back to reality. "Secure the piece, Tennant."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Turning
the master switch off, he pushed himself up out of the tub. The barrels
smoked and sizzled with the falling drizzle. He stepped down and out 
amidst a welter of links and brass.</p>

<p>Jack Durer saw the look on his face. "Having a little fun, Tennant?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes, sir! That's the most fun I ever had in OR out of bed!"</p>

<p>Durer and the rest of the spectators laughed.</p>

<p>"Thanks
for the demonstration, Tennant," said Durer, "I haven't seen one of 
those work since Vietnam." He paused and then asked, "Do you know what 
the Viet Cong called Quad Fifties, Tennant?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, that was before my time."</p>

<p>"They called them "Whispering Death."</p>

<p>"Pretty loud whisper, sir," replied Tennant.</p>

<p>"I
imagine they were talking about being on the receiving end, Bob. You 
don't hear the guns firing or even the ballistic cracks until the rounds
are already in you. I saw a massed attack during Tet just dissolve when
it got hit by one of those." Durer pointed over Tennant's shoulder. 
Durer closed his eyes briefly at the memory and suppressed the urge to 
shudder.</p>

<p>"Hard Ass" Wilson turned to General Chen. "That was 
impressive as hell, Chen, but we aren't going to be fighting human wave 
assaults, are we? Or defending our airfields from Messerschmitt 109s? Or
F-22s?"</p>

<p>"Messerschmitts? F22s? No, General. But Blackhawks? 
Sikorskys? Perhaps. With Raufoss rounds, this is a very potent 
anti-helicopter weapon. Until we get more capable weapon systems, this 
is the only challenge we have to federal control of our airspace, no 
matter how pitiful it may seem when balanced against the threat."</p>

<p>The
General grunted his reluctant agreement. "Yeah, that's kept me up 
nights too. All right, we'll modify the TO&amp;E of what the Governor 
wants us to call the 'Critical Area Security Detachment.' Have you any 
ideas about mounting them to a vehicle like the gun trucks of South 
Vietnam?"</p>

<p>"Yes, General, I do," replied Chen. "I think a two and 
half ton truck as your Army used in Southeast Asia is perhaps too big. 
We can do better, go smaller, faster, more nimble without losing 
stability as a gun platform. I have looked at your Humvee and that might
work, if a bit cramped. I will have you a recommendation within 48 
hours."</p>

<p>"We'll have to recruit gunners and support crews 
discreetly. I don't want just everybody knowing about these. Then we'll 
have to train them discreetly, too." He pondered for a moment. "Once 
they're operational, I'll assign 'em to Shipman's Minuteman Battalion 
for now. Hell, they're his family's guns aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, General," Jack Durer agreed. "They are."</p>

<p>"Well,
if I understand that story correctly, his family stole them so as far 
as I'm concerned he can use them. Although I hope to God he doesn't have
to."</p>

<p>"Indeed," murmured Chen Chao-yeh softly in Mandarin.</p>

<p>"Indeed."</span><p></p>

<h4>Screaming Eagles<br/>
Fort Campbell, KY: Nine Months and Two Days After the Battle of Sipsey Street.</h4>

<p>"Sir, I protest this requisition. If we fill this order it amounts to a full
fifteen percent of our existing stocks. It puts us below our own 
required minimums we may need in case of deployment." The Captain 
looked for hope in the bird colonel's hatchet face. There was none to 
be seen.</p>

<p>The Colonel was sympathetic but his hands were tied. He
replied in a voice of flint, "Captain this order originated in the 
E-Ring. The Corps Commander protested it and was overruled. I assure 
you that you have less stoke in this outfit than General Mackey. You 
understand why these people want our rations, don't you?"</p>

<p>Of 
course O'Toole knew. Anybody who read the front page of any newspaper 
in the United States knew. The Feds and the Brightfire mercenaries 
carrying out Operation Clean Sweep had started turning up poisoned by 
their own rations. Thousands had sickened, hundreds had died. Some 
mess hall or supply chain perpetrators had been caught, but many had 
not. They no longer can trust their own food so they need ours, and 
they need it fast.</p>

<p>The Colonel snapped, "This order will be obeyed, regardless of our opinion of it. So shut up and soldier and get it done."</p>

<p>A
lesser man would have withered under the Colonel's glare. Captain 
O'Toole could just not bring himself to say "Yes, sir." The Colonel 
paused. He hated that they had been tasked with supporting Operation 
Clean Sweep too. The pained look on O'Toole's face caused him to add, 
almost kindly, "Look son, you don't think that the present National 
Command Authority is going to deploy us overseas, do you? They promised
the voters and the voters, God forgive them, gave them the power. The 
only military operations they're interested in pursuing at the moment is
against elements of our own people and the services won't get involved 
in that, thank God. So if we have to give the Feds and the mercenaries 
some of our rations, understand that it could be a lot worse. We could 
be fighting our own people."</p>

<p>The Captain mistook the Colonel's 
softening voice for a weakened resolve and risked an insubordinate 
observation. "Sir, it's just that I hate supporting those murdering 
sons of bi-." </p>

<p>"Enough." The command was iron. "Get it done Captain."</p>

<p>"Yes,
sir." The O'Toole retreated as fast as military decorum permitted. 
Exiting the G-4's office, he walked outside, putting his cover back on 
as he strode across the street to the warehouses beyond. Tall, 
blond-haired and handsome but for the curving scar that ran from his 
cheek up through the right side of his nose (a souvenir of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom), O'Toole was every inch an officer. He was a mustang, 
not a Pointer, and he was damned proud of it. His rise, courtesy of the
killing op tempo of the wars, had been just short of meteoric, but then
no one begrudged him that. He was very competent at any task he was 
assigned and although unknown to O'Toole, the Colonel intended to try to
get him a leaf and bring him along with him when he finally got his 
star.</p>

<p>The Captain entered the relative gloom of the warehouse and
removed his beret, crushing it in his right hand with a killing grip. 
He walked to his office, shut the door behind him and flung the beret 
across the room in frustration. The cover struck the corner of the 
black frame of his favorite picture of the war, an image of O'Toole and 
his men outside Uday and Qusay Hussein's death house, smoke still rising
from the rubble. The force of the blow knocked the picture from the 
wall, and gravity took over, bouncing it off the bookcase below and then
to the floor, where the glass shattered in a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>"Shit!"
the Captain began and followed with 40 or 50 words and phrases, all of 
them profane, some of them scatalogical and some worse than obscene. He
hardly repeated himself.</p>

<p><strong>The Good Soldier Schweik</strong></p>

<p>Master
Sergeant Joshua Robinson watched him through the glass, smiling at some
of the Captain's more original combinations. He sure still swears like 
an enlisted man, Robinson thought with a grin. Finally, O'Toole slumped
in his chair, defeated, spent. After a few minutes, MSG Robinson 
entered. The Captain ignored him.</p>

<p>"No luck, Sir?" the big black
non-com ventured. The Captain looked up. He was still so angry he did
not trust his voice, so he just shook his head.</p>

<p>"Sir," Robinson 
continued, "I think I have an idea. I've been on the phone to a buddy 
of mine at Bragg. They've got the same orders, and well, we talked 
about and I think maybe we can obey the order and still retain our 
honor."</p>

<p>O'Toole, not daring to hope the Master Sergeant was right, asked "How's that?"</p>

<p>"Sir, have you ever heard of "The Good Soldier Schweik?"</p>

<p>O'Toole
smiled broadly for the first time all day. "Yeah I have, first back 
when I was a smart-ass Specialist, and several times since. I've still 
got a copy of <i>The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier &Scaron;vejk During 
the World War</i> on my bookshelf at home. Too bad Jaroslav Hasek never got
a chance to finish it. But what's your point?</p>

<p>"Well, Cap'n 
we've got an order here, and we've got to obey it but that's no reason 
we can't obey it the way we want to, just like Schweik, is there?"</p>

<p>"Go on," urged the Captain, still wondering where this was going.</p>

<p>"Well,
you know how they'd give Schweik an order, like, 'Take this important 
message to headquarters,' and Schweik would run right over to HQ with 
the message but then not give it to anybody because they didn't tell him
to?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said O'Toole carefully.</p>

<p>"Well Cap'n, they 
didn't tell us what KIND of rations to send them did they? If you read 
the order again you'll see they don't specify."</p>

<p>O'Toole didn't have to consult the text, he had it in his head. "That's right, so?"</p>

<p>"Well,
talking to 'Willy' Mayes over at Bragg, we started thinking about all 
the really crappy stuff that's built up in the warehouses over the past 
few years. Stuff we never touched because we were either deployed, or 
we were on mess hall rations. Stuff troopers wouldn't eat, or got 
returned from FTXs unopened. You know we never threw that crap away if 
it was still within its expiration date, we just tossed it in big 
palletized cardboard boxes."</p>

<p>O'Toole nodded, he knew exactly the kind of rations Robinson meant.</p>

<p>"Well,
what got me thinking was 'Willy' mentioned that they had a whole bunch 
of overage 'Four Fingers of Death' MREs that they'd never got around to 
throwing away and said it'd serve those bastards right if he sent 'em 
those. And that's when I thought about Good Soldier Schweik." Master 
Sergeant Joshua Robinson paused. "Sir, you know we've got some of 
those 'Four Fingers of Death,' too. And Chicken Fajitas. And Country 
Captain Chicken..."</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" O'Toole blurted. "That crap tore me up during the invasion..."</p>

<p>"Yeah,"
agreed Robinson, "that stuff was almost as bad as 'The Four Fingers of 
Death.' And you know, sir, those feds and mercenaries, they're not 
going to be used to eating MREs. The ones who don't puke and shit 
themselves to death will be sealed up tighter than a drum for a month 
and you know what THAT'S like."</p>

<h4>Meals Refusing Excretion</h4>

<p>O'Toole
did. M.R.E.'s, "Meal, Ready to Eat," variously known throughout their 
history as as military rations as "Mr. E" (mystery), "Meals Rejected by
Everyone", "Meals, Rarely Edible", "Meals Rejected by the Enemy", 
"Morsels, Regurgitated, Eviscerated", "Materials Resembling Edibles", 
and even "Meals Rejected by Ethiopians", are high in fiber, chemicals, 
vitamins, hormones and God alone knows what else. Some called them 
"Three Lies for the Price of One" - it's not a Meal, it's not Ready, and
you can't Eat it. But the nickname Robinson was referring to was 
"Meals Refusing Excretion." And that O'Toole remembered well.</p>

<p>When
you first eat M.R.E's with regularity your intestines are a mess. You 
will not be able to defecate for several days, sometimes weeks. Then you
hit the point where you are so bloated you don't want to eat and you 
start to feel the contractions and think, "Oh, thank you, blessed 
Jesus!" But then you run to the head and you are forced to give birth 
to a 15 pound iron rod. O'Toole's anal sphincter twinged at the memory 
of it. It was the kind of thing where you hold onto the seat for dear 
life, your legs fully extended and there's this stabbing pain that 
convinces you your guts are being lanced open from the inside out. And 
you grip that seat even tighter, and the only thing that you can think 
about while you groan and grit your teeth and the sweat pours from you 
is that there was once upon a time when your ass did not hurt that much.
 And you pray fervently, feverishly, for the return of that day.</p>

<p>Men had been shot by the enemy and later claimed it did not hurt as much as M.R.E. constipation.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, O'Toole remembered. So did his gut.</p>

<p>"You
know, Master Sergeant, if we rounded up all the toxic M.R.E.'s and 
shipped them to the Feds, we might actually create an entire new front 
in the war." Robinson laughed. "Yes, sir, we would... the Shithouse
Main Line of Resistance." Both men laughed so hard that they were 
heard on the street outside the open warehouse door by a passing 
Specialist who wondered what the joke was. Then they began planning how 
best to emulate The Good Soldier Schweik. </p>

<p>"We'll need to swap boxes on them, sir," Robinson reminded him. </p>

<p>"I'll get the extra hands from the Colonel, and we'll reband them, just like new. We'll still meet the deadline." </p>

<p>O'Toole
paused. "You know when the Feds figure out what we did to them they'll
just shit all over that fancy raid gear of theirs." Robinson looked at
the Captain, shaking his head. "No they won't." Both Screaming Eagles
laughed until they cried.</p>

<h4>Charms<br/>
Ten days later, outside of Idabel, Oklahoma.</h4>

<p>"Sir,
the M.R.E.'s are finally here," said the ASAC's aide. The supervisory 
ATF agent sighed with relief, "Great! Finally food we don't have to 
worry about. It's about time. Fish me out one, Harkins, I'm hungry 
enough to eat a sick snake."</p>

<p>The agent pulled a brown plastic 
envelope out of the box and brought it over to the ASAC, placing it on 
his desk in front of him. The ASAC turned it around and looked at the 
label: "Meal, Ready to Eat, Smoky Franks and Beans." </p>

<p>The ASAC 
snorted in disgust. He was a veteran, he knew what "The Four Fingers of
Death" was. "Harkins," he ordered, "get me another one, I ain't eatin'
this shit." <br>"Sir, they're all the same in this box." </p>

<p>"What! No, there's supposed to be an assortment of meals in each case." </p>

<p>"I know, sir, Special Agent Marx said the same thing, but we've opened 
all of the ones we received and they all have franks and beans in them. 
And Charms candy. They sent us extra packs of Charms candy in each 
box."</p>

<p>The ASAC knew what Charms candy meant too. No 
self-respecting soldier ate Charms. They were considered bad luck, evil
juju, a death wish. They came in the old M.R.E.'s but nobody but 
uninformed Fobbits ate them. </p>

<p>Great, a death wish AND digestive terror from our own Army. "Well shit and shove me in it," said the ASAC.</p>

<p>He looked at the brown envelope. This shit just HAD to be years beyond the expiration date.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, sir? Marx said something about the Charms being bad luck."</p>

<p>"What it means, Harkins, is that our own Army just told us, 'Fuck you.'"</p>

<p>"Well, shit," Harkins blurted, then remembering it was his boss, stammered, "uh, sir."</p>

<p>"Well,
maybe," said the ASAC, "but probably not. Not for a while anyway." 
And then, to no one in particular, "Those dirty stinking bastards. The 
Four Fingers of Death." His hunger overcame his disgust. He took out 
his Gerber, slit the plastic envelope, and removed the contents. "Those
dirty stinking bastards."

M249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Major Swindon: As to that, General, the British soldier will give a good account of himself.</p>

<p>BURGOYNE
[bitterly]: And therefore, I suppose, sir, the British officer need not
know his business: the British soldier will get him out of all his 
blunders with the bayonet. In future, sir, I must ask you to be a little
less generous with the blood of your men, and a little more generous

</blockquote>

<p>Nothing had worked out like it was supposed to, but that was combat.</p>

<p>It had been true in Iraq, it was true in Afghanistan and it was true here.</p>

<p>Who
was it who said "no plan survives contact with the enemy"? Laidlaw 
wondered. Whoever it was had been shot at and that was for sure and 
certain.</p>

<p>Laidlaw had been shot at. He'd been shot at a lot during
one eventful period of his young life. A couple of them had even 
connected. Once in al Nasiriyah on the first tour, but that had been 
barely more than a scratch. He was almost embarrassed to take the Purple
Heart. On his second tour, he'd been hit hard in the left leg. It was 
an inch shorter now, but after his rehab and discharge, he could still 
maneuver.</p>

<p>Barely.</p>

<p>But at least then he'd been fighting 
with other pros. This - well, this was an invitation to die with stupid 
newbies. They were a danger to themselves and a danger to him and it was
a damned shame that a bunch of them were sure to die this day and it 
was all so preventable.</p>

<p>Or at least, it had been.</p>

<p>Time's up, Cathcart, you idiot.</p>

<p>Laidlaw
looked to his left, across the street. The leader of his militia unit, 
Charles Carlos Cathcart (didn't his daddy like him?), peeked around the 
corner at the objective and almost lost his head to a burst from one of 
those Brightfire pricks with a SAW.</p>

<p>Cathcart jerked his head 
back, his face pinched, white as a ghost, his hands visibly trembling 
even from here. Their eyes locked briefly, the entreaty plain to 
Laidlaw. HELP ME, said the look.</p>

<p>Cathcart broke contact first, looking at the ground. Jeez, he didn't even think to bring a steel mirror to look around corners.</p>

<p>Well, hell, I tried to tell him, didn't I? Didn't I?!?</p>

<p>Cathcart,
Laidlaw knew, didn't have a clue about what to do next. Neither did 
about 95% of his unit, which included veterans as old a 56 and kids as 
young as 14, some of 'em girls. Hell, most of the "veterans" had never 
been seriously shot at by somebody who meant it and knew how. They had 
DD-214s, sure, but it was the nature of the military that the 
overwhelming majority of vets were fobbits, support troops, rear echelon
pogues, what his Daddy in Southeast Asia had called "REMFs."</p>

<p>And
Cathcart, who had a knack for getting people to follow him but an 
inability to lead, had been a vehicle mechanic. Oh, his heart was in the
right place, and he had guts - but his brain was still trying to catch 
up.</p>

<p>And, Laidlaw knew, time was something Cathcart no longer had.</p>

<p>Well,
it wasn't like I didn't try to tell him. Cathcart's problem was that he
was too lazy and too desperate to be liked by his people to insist on 
the training they'd needed before this day. Oh, they'd gone through some
half-hearted FTXs, but when Laidlaw had tried to get serious about 
them, Cathcart had undercut him.</p>

<p>Wouldn't even let me condition them properly, Laidlaw thought bitterly.</p>

<p>"We're not the Airborne," Cathcart had whined in explanation, "we're militia."</p>

<p>"My
guys do it," he'd insisted, "even Bobby Marcus and he's 16 and a couch 
potato before I got ahold of him. Now he's a lean, mean kid. He ain't a 
killer yet, but he will be if he has to."</p>

<p>It didn't make a dent 
in Cathcart. He just didn't know what was coming down the pike then, and
now he hasn't got a clue what to do about it.</p>

<p>Before Laidlaw had
joined up, the most Cathcart would have his people do was paintball. 
PAINTBALL, fer cryin' out loud. OK, maybe you got some phys ed out of 
it, but it taught all the wrong tactical lessons. People actually 
thought concealment was cover. Besides, what was cover for a paintball 
wouldn't even be noticed by a 5.56 or 7.62 NATO projectile on its way to
rip out your guts or blow off your head.</p>

<p>Well, those weren't 
paintballs eroding the bricks six inches in front of Cathcart's nose, 
blowing chips and dust all over the place.</p>

<p>NOW do you understand the DIFFERENCE?</p>

<p>Oh,
hell, get a grip, he told himself. If Cathcart lives you can tell him 
"I told you so," but he knows that already. How am I going to get these 
good people through this without ALL of them getting killed?</p>

<p>Especially, he thought selfishly, ME.</p>

<p>Laidlaw
looked behind him at his squad arrayed along the outer back wall of the
auto parts store. Good, he noted with pride, they were set up the way I
taught them, 360 all round, weapons ready, eyeballs seeking danger. 
Scared as shitless as Cathcart, but they were ready in spite of it.</p>

<p>Training did that.</p>

<p>Manny Shinstein, his assistant squad leader, was smiling. Yeah, Manny had been here before too.</p>

<p>Shinstein cocked his head in Cathcart's direction and began to hand sign.</p>

<p>"He's shitting bricks, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Manny
and Laidlaw shared an unusual circumstance for folks who lived on the 
same street in a small Tennessee town. Both of their wives were deaf. 
Funny how things worked out that way. But Manny was good people. An 
ex-Marine, Shinstein had been to Fallujah twice and Afghanistan once. 
Billie and Sheri had met at some function for the deaf, and become 
immediate friends. That drew Manny and him together. It didn't take 
Laidlaw long to forgive Manny Shinstein for being a jarhead.</p>

<p>They
discovered they had a lot in common, including a sick sense of humor 
that started with Monty Python and got worse, as well as a mutual 
penchant for playing the Dropkick Murphys at a decibel level beyond 
pain. When the neighbors complained, Manny told the cop with the face 
and sincerity of the choirboy he'd never been (he was after all Jewish) 
that since his wife was deaf, the only way she could enjoy music was by 
the vibration and didn't the cop know about the Americans with 
Disabilities Act?</p>

<p>Crazy bastard got away with it, too. The neighbors even apologized.</p>

<p>Laidlaw
winked back at Manny. Truth was, Shinstein had a bad case of PTSD, and 
how he kept a lid on it was impressive to Laidlaw. Getting rocked by 
three IEDs will do that to you.</p>

<p>CRAP, LAIDLAW, GET YOUR MIND OUT OF IRAQ AND WRAP IT AROUND THIS LITTLE TACTICAL PROBLEM HERE, his brain screamed at him.</p>

<p>I've
been down this street a hundred times, he thought, yet I can't 
visualize what's on the other side, across the street from the auto 
parts store. That's something else bullets do to you, they mess with 
your mind. I've got to get a look at these bastards and work it from 
there. First, I gotta make sure Cathcart doesn't do anything stupid 
while I'm gone. He waved to get Cathcart's attention and began to hand 
signal. Finally Cathcart nodded, and the relief was plain on his face.</p>

<p>Well, thought Laidlaw, he really did pay attention when we covered that in the first FTX after I joined up. Good.</p>

<p>Signaling
Manny to hold where they were with the rest of the squad, Laidlaw 
pointed out two of his troopers to follow him. They trotted down to the 
old wooden back door of the store. The squad adjusted behind them. I'll 
bet there's a iron bar on the other side.</p>

<p>Maybe two.</p>

<p>Bill 
Bushatz, a young kid fresh out of high school who had started as 
fullback all four years, was the designated entry man. The boy was big 
enough to tote the entry tool without strain and muscular enough to use 
it.</p>

<p>His dad had been arrested in one of the first ATF raids of 
Operation Clean Sweep, but when Laidlaw got to the unit, Cathcart had 
Bill carrying his radio and being his general flunky and dogrobber. 
Laidlaw spotted the boy's true worth and persuaded Cathcart to let him 
have him "temporarily." After getting used to Laidlaw's ways, Bushatz 
refused to go back to being a flunky. Which of course is what Laidlaw 
had expected.</p>

<p>The squad leader pointed his desire, and Bushatz 
took out the hinge side of the door, low, high and in the middle -- one,
BAM, two, BAM, gasp for breath, three, BAM, CLANG!. The door sagged 
inward, but was caught by the bar. Reaching around the splintered 
doorjam, Bushatz' battle buddy John Reynolds got a grip on the bar, 
pulled upward, shoved in and released it. With another clang it hit the 
floor. Another hard shove and the door followed. They entered precisely 
per the MOUT drill he'd taught them, the tactical lights on their 
weapons penetrating the gloom of the back of the store.</p>

<p>Once 
inside, they halted, looking, listening, letting their vision adjust, 
weapons still at the ready. It was a Sunday, and no one was in the 
store. Laidlaw spotted a set of old wooden stairs leading up to the 
second floor. Signaling Bushatz to remain, he and Reynolds moved up the 
stairs, and then forward down the upper hallway.</p>

<p>The floor was 
thick with dust. Nobody had been up here in years. Laidlaw moved 
cautiously up to the begrimed, cob-webbed window that overlooked the 
street, which was now a battlefield. Reynolds automatically took up 
station covering the rear.</p>

<p>Again, Laidlaw felt a tightening of 
his throat in pride. Reynolds was another kid, still in high school, 
what was he, maybe 17? He had never heard a round come up-range in 
anger. He too was scared to death, but he was doing his job, simply 
because he'd done it so often in training it was second nature.</p>

<p>Ignoring
Cathcart's wimpy FTX scehdule, Laidlaw had worked his own guys hard for
months, every spare minute they could all get together. Constant 
physical conditioning. Classroom sessions followed by walk-through 
rehearsals in the abandoned metal fabricating plant down by the river, 
or up in the national forest forty miles away, then full-blown exercises
with blanks and disorienting bird bombs and home-made pyrotechnics 
rolled by Manny -- what he called "my Shinstein Shitters."</p>

<p>Twice 
he'd fired live rounds over their heads or down well-marked lanes to the
side so they would know what an incoming round sounded like.</p>

<p>The fire outside had slackened. Brightfire's waiting for us and Cathcart's waiting for me.</p>

<p>OK,
fine. From the shelter of the brick wall flanking the window, Laidlaw 
studied the scene, taking care to keep out of the light that fitfully 
streamed in the dirty glass as clouds paraded past in front of the late 
morning sun. Backing up deeper into the gloom, he repositioned himself 
on the other side and looked down and across the street to the west this
time. Memory now filled in the rest of the picture he could not see.</p>

<p>The
one-story stone building that Brightfire had taken refuge in was a law 
office and stoutly built. This was Water Street, so named because it ran
haphazardly along the river to its back. The ground sloped steeply 
behind the buildings on the opposite side of the street, through brush 
and trees on the bank. The reason Brightfire had chosen this building 
was burning merrily in front of it. Tires shredded by the ambush it had 
escaped only because one of Cathcart's nervous troops had allowed 
himself to be seen, the Hummer belched black smoke that swirled down 
Water Street in the stiff breeze.</p>

<p>A dead mercenary sat upright behind the wheel, slowly barbequeing. What did that leave, five of them? Four?</p>

<p>Laidlaw's
squad had been assigned the kill zone of the ambush, and even after it 
was blown they managed to get the other two vehicles in the convoy, the 
lead Hummer and and the five ton truck full of detainees. By some 
miracle, only two of the now-liberated prisoners were wounded in the 
process. That, Laidlaw reflected, was another cause for pride. The squad
leader had made sure that all of his men and boys, and one girl, could 
shoot. And when it had come down to it, they'd shot well.</p>

<p>But the
trail vehicle hadn't entered the kill zone and although one of the 
security elements had luckily shot it up enough to stop it, the 
mercenaries, aside from Mr. Crispy there, had made it to the law office.
Lucky for them. It was probably the stoutest building on Water Street.</p>

<p>OK.
Their reaction force has got to be mounting up by now. Air cover 
probably inbound NOW. What, fifteen minutes, maybe less? We're running 
out of time and we ought to be fading -- right now.</p>

<p>Leave 'em? 
Burn 'em out? The stone walls wouldn't burn, that was for sure. We've 
got no heavy weapons. What I wouldn't give for a couple of Javelins or 
even an AT-4, although the stone structure looked stout enough to turn 
an AT-4.</p>

<p>THINK.</p>

<p>M203. In the windows. Hell, yeah.</p>

<p>He'd seen one down on the road in the kill zone and ordered it policed up. Who'd got it?</p>

<p>He keyed his squad radio for Manny. "Kilo Two, send up that M203 and all the rounds we got."</p>

<p>"Roger."</p>

<p>A pause, and then: "Triple C's looking like he's about to do something."</p>

<p>"Shit! Tell that dopey bastard to keep his dick in his pants, I've got this thing licked."</p>

<p>"I'm trying . . Oh, SHIT!"</p>

<p>Cathcart
had been sweating ever since Laidlaw had disappeared into the building.
WHAT was taking so long? They had to go, didn't he know that? They had 
to finish this thing NOW, before help arrived.</p>

<p>It didn't help 
that the squad on his left flank was commanded by Duke Conners, a guy 
with more testosterone than brains who had watched too many war movies 
over his 36 years. Conners noted that the SAW firing at his people 
seemed to be unable to depress its muzzle enough to engage them. The 
tracers were going head high and no lower. This was his big chance. If 
he could just get in there and toss some of their improvised hand 
grenades in the side windows this would be all over. Connors knew that 
Cathcart was uncertain. That damn Laidlaw was just nervous in the 
service.</p>

<p>Big bad veteran. So what?</p>

<p>This wasn't so tough. He'd talked Cathcart into it, and now he, Duke Conners, was going to finish this thing.</p>

<p>It
would have been worse if fully half of Conners' squad hadn't disobeyed 
him out of inexperience, indiscipline, fear or uncommon good sense. When
Duke ordered the entire squad to keep low and charge the building, only
five people followed him. The rest hung back, firing in support but not
venturing from cover.</p>

<p>For two seconds, maybe three, long enough 
to take them past the point of no return and fully into the middle of 
the street, the SAW continued firing high.</p>

<p>Then it shifted.</p>

<p>Not
one of them made it, either to the stone building or back to safety. 
Duke Connors' spine was, in part, blown out his back along with chunks 
of gut and muscle and as his legs quit working he pitched headlong onto 
the pavement. He bounced once and slid to a stop on his face. Duke's 
vision flickered long enough to register the fact that his 16 year old 
son Jeff lay dead three yards away, his head exploded.</p>

<p>Then Duke 
Conners died. The lumber mill supervisor hadn't watched enough war 
movies to keep from being fooled by the oldest trick in the 
machinegunner's book, one that dated back to the first World War.</p>

<p>Cathcart
watched the destruction of Conner's squad in horrified disbelief, 
focusing on the small form of young Jeff Conners, still twitching and 
jerking as the gunner played part of another belt across the corpses, in
an effort to get one of their friends to do something stupid in 
reaction. Filled with equal parts of wrath, hatred and guilt, Charles 
Carlos Cathcart obliged him and stepped from cover to engage the gun. A 
Brightfire rifleman, firing from another window, put a bullet through 
his head.</p>

<p>Jenny Wilson delivered the M-203 to Laidlaw just as 
Conners' valiant but doomed half dozen broke from cover. By that time, 
Laidlaw had moved to the front office to the left off the hallway and 
eased up the window until he had an unobstructed shot at the law 
office's front windows. Wilson's chest was heaving and her eyes were 
wide, but she'd shouldered that M16A2 with the grenade launcher since 
the ambush. And it was she who'd put two rounds through the officer in 
truck's cab, thereby saving at least some of the detainees from murder. 
Laidlaw had been resistant when she insisted she wanted to be in his 
squad. He knew it was because she was sweet on Bill Bushatz.</p>

<p>But 
try as he might, he couldn't run her off. He tried running her into the 
ground, grinding her down in PT, picking on her for every dirty detail. 
He couldn't scare her and he couldn't run her off. She not only did her 
job and carried her own weight, she had better military sense than most 
of the rest of his squad, always awake and alert, always THINKING. He 
had her marked for Corporal if she stood up to seeing the elephant. 
Well, she had. And now she watched her squad leader with intensity, 
curous to see how this unfamiliar weapon worked.</p>

<p>Laidlaw heard 
the round that fatally compromised the integrity of Cathcart's 
braincase, and saw the window it had come from. OK, bastard, you first. 
He keyed the mike. "Kilo Two, four rounds, take it when I'm done." </p>

<p>"Roger. Four rounds."</p>

<p>They
were easy shots and Laidlaw was well experienced with the 203. With the
range so short, he didn't even flip up the sights. The first HE round 
sailed through the window hole and blew up within, debris flying out the
window. Laidlaw switched to the other front window to the left of the 
door and did likewise with it. Then he put two rounds into the doorway. 
The first hit the top hinge and blew the door partially out of the jam 
and down, creating a hole that the fourth and final round sailed 
through, exploding deep within the building.</p>

<p>Instantly Manny took
the squad across the street and assaulted the law office. A few muffled
bursts and it was over. Manny came out a minute later, hoisting a Squad
Automatic Weapon over his right shoulder.</p>

<p>By the time the first 
Brightfire gunship came over the ambush site and then floated down to 
the river and hovered over the law office, the militia, now commanded by
Lawrence "Larry" Laidlaw (nobody called him Lawrence) had vanished. 
Even the bodies of their fallen had been policed up.</p>

<p>Laidlaw 
watched the chopper circle ineffectually through 7x50 binoculars from a 
distant tree line. He turned to the young and old men and women (no boys
and girls now) who were nearby and ordered, "Move out."</p>

<p>One thing was certain. There was going to be a lot more training in their future.</p>

<p>A whole lot more.

<h4>One Year, Two Months and Seventeen Days After the Death of Phil Gordon in the "Battle of Sipsey Street"</h4>

<h4>Washington DC, 4:52 PM EST<br/>
Office of the Assistant Director for Field Operations</h4>

<p>The AD Ops looked up from the file and into the eyes of Special Agent Dickerson. "Anything else on Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Which one, sir?"</p>

<p>"The oldest one, the Army officer."</p>

<p>"Robert Gordon, sir, and he's an ex-army officer now," Dickerson mildly corrected his boss.</p>

<p>"Yeah," snickered the AD, "Not such a big shot since we had him run out of the service, is he?"</p>

<p>"Well,
sir, he's pretty down on his luck. We strung out the aiding and 
abetting charges as long as we could, but we didn't really want to go to
trial on those."</p>

<p>The AD nodded.</p>

<p>"As you know his wife 
left him about four months ago, after his dismissal from the service was
confirmed and their property seizure was affirmed by the Appellate 
Court. She's living with her mother now, working as a..." Dickerson 
consulted his notebook, "A medical secretary for a physician in private 
practice in Duluth. Of course with his accounts forfeited he has no 
fallback income. Everything his father owned was also seized as products
of a criminal enterprise, so he can't tap into what no longer exists. 
He has been unable to get a job as a pilot or anything else, thanks to 
our efforts... His brother and sister have floated him some modest 
loans over the past few months but as you know, they have their own 
financial problems too."</p>

<p>The AD beamed, since he was personally responsible for the Gordon siblings' reversal of fortune.</p>

<p>"We
had him under close 24 hour surveillance until after the anniversary 
passed. The behavioral psychologist on the fourth floor who's studied 
his medical reports from the VA psychiatrist says he's just beat, sir. 
He blames his father for his troubles more than us, according to the 
anecdotal evidence we've been able to gather. In fact, our shrink says 
we should lighten up on him a bit, now that it seems he's not going to 
be a problem. Give him something to live for."</p>

<p>Dickerson looked up from his notes to see the AD Ops shaking his head.</p>

<p>"That's
exactly what were NOT going to do. We're going to keep grinding that 
bastard until there's nothing left of him. His damned killer father 
wasted over a hundred of our agents but he's dead and I can't do 
anything to him, so I'm doing the next best thing. I'm going to grind 
every one of that traitor's spawn into dust. Teach them to screw with 
the United States government."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Dickerson. "Shall I continue the electronic surveillance to verify his whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Hell yes," growled the AD.</p>

<p>"And what next, sir?"</p>

<p>"Have we audited his taxes yet?"</p>

<p>"No sir."</p>

<p>"Well do it. I'm not going to be happy until the SOB puts a gun to his sorry head. See to it, Dickerson."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Dickerson didn't begin to breathe freely again until he got back to his kiosk two floors below. He dropped into his chair.</p>

<p>"Well," asked Nick Brudi, who ran the domestic terror desk next to his, "how'd it go?"</p>

<p>Dickerson
blew out his cheeks before replying, "Fluid, plenty fluid. The stupid 
bastard wants me to keep after ex-colonel Gordon until he blows his 
brains out."</p>

<p>"Who's? Gordon's or the AD's?" Brudi asked with a grin.</p>

<p>But
Dickerson wasn't laughing. "Yeah, that's IT exactly," he exclaimed. "You
saw what happened after we picked on the old man when he didn't have 
anything to live for. And now we're going to put his son, a West 
Point-trained frigging military genius and genuine hero, into the same 
spot? When are they going to frigging learn? When ex-colonel Gordon 
whips up an atom bomb out of Drano, ant poison and common household 
appliances and shoves it up OUR asses?"</p>

<p>Brudi thought for a moment. "Isn't what the AD wants kinda contrary to the decision that the Director made after Sipsey Street?" Brudi asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Dickerson with disgust, "You wanna tell the AD about it? Or maybe the Director?"</p>

<p>Brudi sank deeper into his chair. "Not a chance in hell," he muttered in reply.</p>

<p>"Well, then shut up and let me think. Now I've got to have an audit run on the poor bastard."</p>

<p>Brudi decided he didn't want to know any more. Even with Senator Schumer
running interference for them on the Judiciary Committee, and his party
in control at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, you never could tell 
when some lowly congressman they didn't own might get leaked some damn 
memo that should have been shredded in the first place. Better not to 
know so he wouldn't have to testify under oath one way or the other.</p>

<p>Brudi
struggled not to listen as Dickerson tried to reach somebody after 
hours at IRS on the phone. You sure as hell wouldn't want to send an 
email on THAT. Brudi approved and, nodding his head, went back to reading the latest wiretaps of that mouthy militia leader in Alabama. God, the sonofabitch was long-winded. But with the new laws passed after the Battle of Sipsey Street, his time was coming shortly. If he survived the bust, which Brudi doubted, he could be long-winded in the shower at Supermax playing drop the soap with the Muslim Brotherhood, or maybe the Aryans -- they HATED this guy. The thought comforted Nick Brudi immensely.</p>

<p><strong>"Fort Stinking Desert"</p>

<p></strong>Just as Special Agent Dickerson was on the phone to Treasury, Robert Gordon was met at the door of a modest old ranch house in the hills outside Kingman, Arizona. Bill Pritchard,
a white haired, weathered old pilot with about a gazillion hours in the
air who still looked ten years younger than he was, hugged him and 
pulled him in close.</p>

<p>"Bobby, I'm damn glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Same here Uncle Bill... It's been a while."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I didn't get to the funeral, Bobby... you know why I couldn't now."</p>

<p>"Yeah," replied the younger man, who was clearly just about done in from the last 18 hours on the road.</p>

<p>"Look,
Bobby, I know you're beat and Sylvia's got a bed made up in the back 
for you, but I've got to ask you a few questions before you turn in. And
I'm sure you've got some too." Phil Gordon's oldest son just nodded. 
"Anyway, let's get that out of the way and we'll cover everything else 
tomorrow. I've got some fellows coming over to meet you then and we'll 
get serious."</p>

<p>Robert Gordon perked up at that. "Are we going to get serious? he asked."</p>

<p>"As
serious as anything I've ever done in my life," replied the old pilot. 
"But let me ask you this. Did you have trouble with the link-up outside 
Dallas?"</p>

<p>Bobby Gordon gave a thin smile. "No, but you sure have a talent for cloak and dagger. Where'd you meet that Cuban exile? I thought you weren't at The Bay of Pigs operation."</p>

<p>"I wasn't. I met him later when we did some drops for ole Bill Colby." The old man grinned back. "Did he scare ya?"</p>

<p>"No, but his frisking was so thorough I thought he was going to get out the rubber gloves."</p>

<p>"Bobby," said the old man with a suddenly straight face, "If the electronics had detected any nanobugs in you, he'd a done it so fast you wouldn't want a smoke afterwards."</p>

<p>"Where's my car, now?"</p>

<p>"Bobby,
its on the way to Mexico, along with a guy who looks so much like you 
your mother-in-law wouldn't know the difference from three feet. Welcome
to the American Underground."</p>

<p>Bill Pritchard
saw the shadow pass across Bobby's face. Ouch. I forgot. After a moment
he asked, "How much of the divorce was real and how much was 
operational cover?"</p>

<p>Robert Gordon sighed. "You mind if I sit down?"</p>

<p>"No, no, let's go back to the den, its more secure than Langley back there."</p>

<p>Pritchard
led the younger man back through the hall. The exhausted younger man 
sat carefully, but precisely erect. You can take the eagles off a man's 
shoulders, Bill Pritchard thought, but you can't take them from his soul.</p>

<p>They both started to say something, stopped, then Robert Gordon went on, "No, it was real. Anna went from being a General's
daughter, married to another up and coming general officer candidate 
one day, to the daughter-in-law of the greatest mass murderer of federal
'law enforcement officers' since David Koresh.
. . Matter of fact, Dad made every cop killer for the last hundred 
years look like underachievers." Gordon gave that wan smile again and 
shook his head. "You know when Dad did something, he always went all 
out."</p>

<p>"He had no choice, Bobby, you know that. Those bastards wouldn't have given him a Chinaman's chance and you KNOW that. Hell, I wouldn't have been his friend if he wasn't thoroughly competent at what he did."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess so."</p>

<p>"No,
there's no 'guess so' about it. We decided a long time ago when the 
damn political winds began to blow against us in this country that he 
would be the loud-mouth and I would stay still. That's what they hated 
about him, that he had the guts to call 'em for the dirty 
freedom-stealing bastards that they were. That's why they came to kill 
him. It's the only real law that he broke, an unwritten law. He had guns
and opinions at the same time -- he was a FREE MAN -- and the ATF won't stand for that."</p>

<p>Robert Gordon just looked at the older man. If he didn't have the thousand yard stare, Pritchard
thought, he was working on seven-fifty. "Come on, Bobby, get up and 
I'll show you your room. Since we shucked you of all your luggage and 
clothes, I'll go out tomorrow and get you some. You'll stay in close 
here until the meeting."</p>

<p>"Clothes?" said Bobby Gordon shaking his
head, "That damn Cuban of yours even took my watch and my shoes. He 
wanted to take my West Point ring, but I told him he'd have to fight me 
to get it."</p>

<p>Bill Pritchard laughed. "Bobby, he's got 30 years on you but he'd a whupped you just the same."</p>

<p>"Good night, Bobby," said Pritchard, as he closed the bedroom door. Then, to himself, softly, "Get some sleep, son, you're gonna need it."</p>

<p>Bobby Gordon slept for twelve solid hours. When he awoke, Bill Pritchard was fixing <em>huevos rancheros</em>
in an impossibly huge skillet in the ranch kitchen. "I'm going 
jogging," said Gordon, "Anything I need to know about the lay of the 
land?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Pritchard, "Don't. Use the treadmill in the room off the laundry back to your left. I'd rather you didn't show yourself just now."</p>

<p>"Oh, OK," said Gordon and back he went to the exercise room and whipped off a five mile run.</p>

<p>The
eggs were on the table, along with bacon, Texas toast and hot sauce 
when he toweled off the sweat and made his way back to the kitchen. Pritchard was sitting at the table with another older man, shorter than Pritchard by a good six inches, porkier too and gray bearded with an equally gray ponytail hanging half-way down his back.</p>

<p>"Bout damn time you got here," said the stranger, "these eggs is as cold as my ex-wife's heart."</p>

<p>Bobby Gordon laughed in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"Bobby," said Pritchard, "meet Bill Dodd, another transplanted Alabamian who's been living in Fort Stinking Desert so long he forgot what grits are."</p>

<p>"Pleased ta meetcha," said Dodd. "Kin we say grace now?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pritchard.</p>

<p>Without further ceremony, Bill Dodd
bowed his pony-tailed head and prayed loudly and fervently, "Oh Lord, 
help us this day to confound your heathen enemies and we beseech Thee to
smite them every chance You can." And then, more slowly and seriously, 
"Bless this food to our bodies and our bodies to Your service, in Jesus 
name we pray, amen."</p>

<p>Pritchard snorted, "You're gonna go to Hell, praying like that."</p>

<p>Bill Dodd grinned, "As long as the entire Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms goes first... Let's eat."</p>

<p>For a few minutes there was no conversation as the plates were passed and the eggs and toast consumed.</p>

<p>Finally, Bill Pritchard asked, "How's your brother and sister holding up, Bobby?"</p>

<p>Bobby
Gordon looked at him, paused, and shook his head. "It's been tough. 
Johnny and Sally are still hanging in there. Of course he lost every 
government contract his company had and auditors are crawling all over 
him. Little Phil and his brother Matt got into so many fights at school 
that Sally's homeschooling them now. Sissy's OK. Sissy's strong. 
Probably the strongest one of us all. Of course her job isn't as subject
to government pressure as Johnny's is or mine was." Bobby looked 
distantly out the window in the uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>The look on Bill Dodd's face was nothing short of hatred. "<i>Sippenhaft</i>." He spat the word out.</p>

<p>The two other men looked at him. "Pardon?" asked Pritchard. "<i>Sippenhaft.</i> <i>Sippenhaft</i> is German for 'kin liability'. It was a little thing the Nazis came up with after Count von Stauffenberg almost got Der Fuhrer with that bomb on the 20th
of July, '44. Old Himmler reintroduced the concept of 'blood guilt' 
from back in Teutonic times, or so he claimed. Said something like, 'Our
ancestors said, this man has committed treason; his blood is bad; there
is traitor's blood in him; that must be wiped out. And in the blood 
feud the entire clan was wiped out down to the last member.' Something 
like that. The Nazis would kill a man's wife, his father, his mother, 
his brothers, take away the small children, rename 'em and put 'em in 
orphanages so they'd never know who their parents were. Even extended it
to the relatives of military commanders who Hitler thought were 
defeatist or cowardly. Stalin did the same thing in the Great Purge of 
the Thirties with 'relatives of the enemies of the people.' Mao did it 
again in the Cultural Revolution. Hell, the North Koreans still do it. 
It's the mark of a tyrannical dictatorship, which I guess is what we're comin' to."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Pritchard, "I guess so."</p>

<p>Bobby Gordon was silent for a moment and then, looking back out the window said, almost to himself, "It's going to get worse."</p>

<p>Pritchard reached across the short distance between them and touched the younger man's hand gently. "You want to stop now?" he asked.</p>

<p>Bobby
Gordon turned his gaze into his father's best friend's face. It was a 
hard gaze, and his own face was now set. "No. My dad didn't start this 
war, they brought it to him. Now I'm going to take it to them, and 
you're going to help me. That's what I'm here for, right?"</p>

<p>Pritchard and Dodd both grinned. "Hell yeah," growled Dodd.</p>

<p>"The
question I've had in my mind ever since I buried what was left of my 
Dad is how? How do we reach out and get the big bastards who sent the 
little bastards who killed my dad? How do we get the bureaucratic SOBs who wage '<em>sippenhaft</em>' on innocent people like Johnny and Sissy?"</p>

<p>The question hung in the air only for a moment. Bill Pritchard answered with another grin, "Son, did I ever tell you what Kingman, Arizona was famous for before it was the temporary residence of that miserable methamphetamine addict and neoNazi accomplice to mass murder Timothy 'I can't get a date so I think I'll be a terrorist' McVeigh?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Bobby Gordon.</p>

<p>So Bill Pritchard
told him. And as the tale unfolded, Robert Gordon, late Colonel of the 
United States Army, son of the deceased Phil Gordon, "the Sipsey
Street mass murderer," began to see that the detritus of history can 
sometimes be cobbled together and re-forged into a modern weapon capable
of equal portions of justice and vengeance.</p>

<p>And for the first time in a long time, Bobby Gordon began to smile.</p>

<h4>17 July 1915</h4>

<p>Aram
Avakian's father was herding his goats in the hills above their village
at the base of the mountain that the Ottoman Empire called Musa Dagh 
but the Armenian Christians called Musa Mer when the Turkish gendarmes 
came, looking for a little diversion.  Ordered to hide and be silent no 
matter what happened, little Aram hid under a large basket and listened 
as the Turks raped his mother, one after another.  Aram could hear his 
mother moaning and weeping and the laughter of the gendarmes.  When they
were done, just before they bayoneted her, one of them asked, "Where's 
your Christ to protect you now?"</p>

<p>When they were gone, Aram ran to find his father.</p>

<p>There
were six villages of at least five thousand Armenians scattered around 
the base of Musa Mer and all had been ordered to evacuate and march to 
somewhere in the interior, away from the Mediterranean Sea.  Having 
heard rumors of what happened to other Armenian Christians when given 
similar orders, most of the villagers decided to withdraw up the 
mountain, construct defensive positions and defy the order.  </p>

<p>Some,
about 60 families, decided they would be safer if they obeyed the 
order.  They marched off with all that they could carry, and were never 
heard from again.</p>

<p>Between the six villages the Armenians had 
managed to hide about a hundred and twenty modern rifles and shotguns 
from the authorities when they had previously been ordered to give them 
up.  In addition, they had perhaps another 350 out-dated flintlock 
muskets and old horse pistols.</p>

<p>The Armenians stripped out their 
homes and shops of every manner of provision and carried them up the 
mountainside.  That took them one whole day.  They immediately placed 
sharpshooters at key points and began digging trenches and constructing 
road blocks.</p>

<p>Arriving to find the Armenians gone, the Turkish 
Army was ordered up the mountain to round them up and kill all who 
resisted, which it would later turn out, had been the plan all along.</p>

<p>On
21 July, a force of 200 Turkish soldiers moved up Musa Dagh in 
expectation of an easy victory.  After losing a number of casualties and
a mountain howitzer, they retreated.  The next attack consisted on 
3,000 soldiers and a large number of gendarmes and Muslim irregulars and
the Turks drove to within 400 yards of the Armenian camp.  Only a deep 
ravine separated them from their prey.  By this time night had fallen 
and the Turks settled in, expecting to finish the job in the morning.</p>

<p>In
the darkness, having no other option, the Armenians took a page from 
the Bible and duplicated Gideon's feat by infiltrating down and around 
the Turkish position until they had it surrounded.  When they attacked, 
the startled Turks were first thrown into confusion, then panic.  The 
Turkish soldiers and their irregular allies fled down the mountain, 
leaving their camp and considerable war material and food behind.</p>

<p>But
they did not go away.  A siege now began and by late August, starvation
was stalking the Armenians on Musa Mer, which means "the mountain of 
Moses."  A runner was dispatched through the Turkish lines to the 
American consul at Allepo asking for neutral aid.  He never arrived.  A 
strong swimmer made it to Alexandretta harbor looking for blockading 
Allied warships.  There were none.<br>  <br>Two large flags were made, 
one with a large red cross in the middle of it.  The other read 
"Christians in distress: Rescue."  These were tied to tall trees, but 
this was the season of heavy rains and fog, so there was little chance 
they would be seen.</p>

<p>The Turks attacked again, and were repulsed 
again, barely.  It was doubtful the Armenians would be able to resist 
another.  Aram, weak with hunger and too young to fight, said many 
prayers for their deliverance.  God heard him.</p>

<p>On the 53rd day of
the siege, one of the Armenian lookouts spotted the French light 
cruiser Guichen offshore.  Her lookouts had spotted the red cross 
banner.  Guichen's captain launched a shore party in boats to 
investigate, and under the protection of her big guns the Turks dared 
not intervene.</p>

<p>After linking up with the Armenians and learning 
their plight, the Guichen's captain wirelessed his squadron commander on
his flagship, the heavy cruiser  Ste. Jean d'Arc.  The admiral issued 
orders that that all available ships proceed to Musa Dagh to take on the
survivors of the siege.</p>

<p>Aram Arkanian's prayers were answered.  
Over 4,000 Armenian Christians were saved by four French ships of the 
admiral's squadron and a nearby British man-of-war.</p>

<p>French 
sailors had to pry the captured Turkish Mauser rifle out of the hands of
his father before they would let him on board the boat taking them to 
the Ste. Jean d'Arc.  </p>

<p>"Never forget, Aram," his father cautioned
him as they watched from the Ste. Jean d'Arc's stern railing as their 
ancestral home faded into the distance.</p>

<p>"No matter where we go and what God brings us in the future, never forget."  Aram didn't.</p>

<h4>Almost one century later.</h4>

<p>The
basement room was black, illuminated only by the flickering images of 
the wide-screen television. Six men sat in various relaxed postures, 
scattered between couches, easy chairs and bar stools.</p>

<p>One of 
them, with a tattoo on his right forearm of St. Joan of Arc, the patron 
saint of soldiers, in battle armor and brandishing a large flag, held 
the remote.  Curiously, the flag Saint Joan waved was not that of the 
Fleur de Lis, nor the Cross of Lorraine but one bearing a simple red 
cross.  An historian, not knowing the real story behind the tattoo, 
would have thought it an anachronism and in error.  It was neither.</p>

<p>On the screen Joe O'Reilly entered a room and demanded, "Jesus Christ, Mick, where the HELL have you been?"</p>

<p>"Been workin'" muttered an exhausted Michael Collins, his head down on the desk.</p>

<p>"Workin' where?" Joe shot back. Sleepily, Collins begins to give orders.</p>

<p>"I
want a file drawn up on every member of the British administration. 
Look through whatever you can find. Who's Who. Stubb's, Society columns.
I want names, addresses, clubs, where they bank down to what they eat 
for breakfast. Keep it up to date. Add to it every week."</p>

<p>Michael Collins begins to rouse. "Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom Cullen answers, "Um?"</p>

<p>"Tom!" Collins gets up from the table.</p>

<p>"Yeah!"</p>

<p>"Get me a list of the twelve best men in the Dublin division. Young. Without families."</p>

<p>"What for," asks Cullen.</p>

<p>"Christ," Collins realizes, "the 'Twelve Apostles'. Just do it, for fook's sake!"</p>

<p>"Joe, take a letter."</p>

<p>Collins' number two, Harry Boland enters, demanding "Where the hell have you been?"</p>

<p>Collins ignores him and begins dictating.</p>

<p>"'To
whom it may concern. This is to inform you that any further 
collaboration with the forces of occupation will be punishable by death.
You have been warned.' Signed, 'The Irish Republican Army.'"</p>

<p>Boland asks, incredulous, "Are you serious?"</p>

<p>"'Fraid so," answers Collins. Then he orders Joe, "Send one to every G-Man..."</p>

<p>Neeson was born for this role, thought Steve Avakian.</p>

<p>"Without
them the Brits would have no system. They couldn't move. Imagine the 
Castle like an enclave where anyone, and I mean anyone, who collaborated
knew he'd be shot. They couldn't move outside those fooking walls. 
THAT'S how serious I am."</p>

<p>Boland, now realizing how serious Collins is, offers, "There's only one problem."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"We'd have to do it."</p>

<p>"Yes," says Collins. "So, could you bear it?"</p>

<p>Avakian hit freeze on the DVD remote, and leaned over the bar to hit the alcove light switch.</p>

<p>"What's
the big deal, Steve?" The man in the Lazy Boy brought it upright and 
stood. "We've got this damn movie memorized, you played it so often in 
Kabul."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to remind you of the thinking process behind the Anglo-Irish War because Collins was successful."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mark Volescu.</p>

<p>"Because of this." Steve handed out each of them a copy of a letter. "Read it, and then we'll talk."</p>

<p>It was dated over two years before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You've got us surrounded, you poor bastards."</p>

<p>Memo for the Record to the Next Congress</p>

<p>To: The Victors of the Recent National Elections<br>From: Your gun-owning constituents<br>Subject: The so-called "Gun Show Loophole"</p>

<p>Congratulations. You have just been swept into power. Enjoy the feeling.</p>

<p>But
come January, the special interests who put you there are going to be 
banging on your door asking for various favors. Some of them are going 
to be demanding more gun control legislation, among them a law to close 
the so-called "gun show loophole."</p>

<p>Heretofore, the bumbling GOP 
has at least been able to fend off these attempts at our liberties, but 
those corrupt incompetents have now been justifiably swept from power 
for their other numerous political sins. Neither Presidential candidate 
mentioned the subject much during the campaign (for good reasons), but 
both are on record as supporting previous bills aimed at exerting 
complete federal control over the private sale of arms.</p>

<p>You call this "reasonable regulation."</p>

<p>We
call it tyranny, for not even King George III was so grasping. But 
since you won the election, it will be your candidate who takes the oath
and signs the bill. It may be assumed that the new president will sign 
such a bill if you place it before him. However, we do not address this 
memo to him. It is the darker angels of YOUR nature we are seeking to 
save you from, as I will explain below.</p>

<p>The hubris derived from 
your own smashing electoral victory may incline you to listen to those 
voices demanding that you seize the moment for more gun control. If I 
may, let me explain the possible personal, unintended consequences of 
such an act to you.</p>

<p>There are in your district, in your state and
indeed all over the country, a great number of gun owners just like me.
I suppose if you added us all up there at least a million or two of us.</p>

<p>Maybe more, maybe less, but once you get into numbers like that, what's a million more or less?</p>

<p>We
are the 'cold, dead hands" types, the men and women who have sworn, as 
the old bumper sticker said, "When guns are outlawed, I'll be an 
outlaw." We have fought a political delaying action against the enemies 
of our traditional 2nd Amendment rights for decades now. Indeed, we have
been shoved back from the free exercise of our historic firearms 
liberty for 70 plus years.</p>

<p>Now it is plain that we have lost the argument at the polls.</p>

<p>No matter.</p>

<p>You
feel a natural pride at having swept the GOP from the field. But you 
should know that in doing so you have removed any hope we ever had of 
successfully defending our right to armed self-defense in the political 
arena. You will also take up, and I'm certain you will pass, the 
Fairness Doctrine to shut up the talk radio hosts who have so bedeviled 
you these past twenty years. As well, you will pass an Amnesty Bill for 
illegal aliens, which you believe will make any further conservative 
success in national elections impossible. You are right on both counts. 
And, because you now have the votes, you will be successful. You will 
think you have a mandate for whatever you do. And yet...</p>

<p>Consider
where this puts us. We will no longer have the possibility of stopping 
further attacks on our God-given liberties politically. We will not even
be able to vent our frustration on talk radio. I'm sure you will also 
get around to "hate speech regulation" of the Internet. And in the 
middle of this you will try to disarm us by means of a "gun show 
loophole" bill, or a new tougher "assault weapons ban" or a ban on 
"assault weapons ammunition" and "armor piercing bullets" which will 
include simple hunting ammunition, or probably a combination of all 
three. Perhaps you will stealthily try to do these things by quietly 
having the ATF manipulate the regulatory process.</p>

<p>Quiet or not, we will notice.</p>

<p>You
will do this because you think you can do it without political or 
personal retribution. I write you today to tell you that if you do so, 
you will be as wrong as you could possibly be.</p>

<p>You believe that 
if you pass a law backed by the threat of federal violence for 
non-compliance, that we will do what you order without resistance. You 
believe this because you are extrapolating our anticipated behavior from
your own cowardice, You know that YOU would never do such a thing, so 
we won't either. This is a dangerous assumption on your part, perhaps 
fatally so. For if the discredited Republicans no longer protect us from
you, then they no longer protect you from us, either.</p>

<p>You've got us surrounded, you poor bastards.</p>

<p>Remember
that we consider our rights merely codified by the Constitution. They 
are, we sincerely believe, God-given and inalienable. Remember too that 
we are willing to die for our liberties rather than surrender them up 
meekly. Remember as well that men and women who are willing to die for 
their principles are most often willing to kill for them too.</p>

<p>What can this possibly have to do with you?</p>

<p>Well,
it's like this. We have been doing a lot of thinking about what we 
would do if we ever found ourselves in this situation, and after 
considerable thought we have decided we agree with Bill Clinton. Back in
1999, when he was trying to pressure the Serbians into giving up 
Kosovo, then President Clinton expanded American rules of war to include
-- as legitimate targets of deadly force -- the politicians and the 
news media that shaped and supported his enemy's war policy.</p>

<p>Not 
to put too fine a point on it, but if you force us into resistance by 
further circumscribing our rights -- by sending federal police to our 
doors to enforce your will -- can't those same Clintonian rules of 
engagement be applied to you?</p>

<p>Oh, we could certainly defend 
ourselves by shooting back at the hapless instruments of your tyranny --
the sons and daughters of other Americans who happen to be in federal 
service.</p>

<p>But wouldn't it be wiser for us -- after the first, 
second or third time this happens -- to adopt Clinton's policy and go 
after the people who sent them? That is, to seek out the bureaucrats and
politicians who decided to start the war? And, like Clinton, should we 
target the media talking heads and newspaper editors who clamored for it
in the first place?</p>

<p>The advocates of citizen disarmament are 
probably willing to fight a war down to the last dead ATF agent, but are
YOU willing to fight one past the first dead politician? And how many 
dead editors will it take to change an editorial board policy?</p>

<p>If you pass new gun control laws we will find out.</p>

<p>The
president of course will be the safest personage in the country under 
this awful scenario. Killing a president, even if he signed such an 
unconstitutional law, would be tantamount to firing on Fort Sumter, a 
discrediting move no matter what the provocation.</p>

<p>But, one 
wonders, who would cry over a dead congressman or senator who voted to 
take people's liberty, property and lives? Especially after innocent 
victims of his predatory law-making were already littering the streets. 
You may recall the already lower-than-a-snake's-belly position in the 
polls that Congress currently holds.</p>

<p>Who indeed would mourn you, beyond your family, your mistress and a few lobbyists?</p>

<p>Also,
it may be cold comfort, but we will make sure that your family remains 
behind to mourn you. We will do a far better job of protecting innocents
than the federal government, perhaps because we don't own any Predator 
drones or F18s or Hellfire missiles or cluster bombs. You will get no 
terrorist outrages like Oklahoma City to easily discredit us - just 
remorseless and deadly accurate rifle bullets, one at a time. Those are 
OUR precision guided munitions.</p>

<p>Do you really think that in the long run that yours will be more effective than ours?</p>

<p>These
are the uncomfortable questions that must be asked now rather than 
later. Unless, of course, you decide that discretion is the better part 
of valor and -- out of enlightened self-interest -- you refuse to 
meander down the bloody garden path toward civil war at the urging of 
the honey-tongued Sirens of "reasonable regulation" gun control.</p>

<p>It's
always important for any card player to know the rules of the game 
before the deck is cut. By sweeping away the sorry GOP, and stacking the
deck with the Fairness Doctrine and enfranchised illegals to toil on 
your political plantation, you will have changed the political rules 
fundamentally and, perhaps, forever.</p>

<p>Please understand that just 
because you can disenfranchise us, swamp us at the polls, silence us on 
the radio and Internet, despise us and ridicule us in the media, you 
still cannot take any more of our liberties without our acquiescence. 
And we do not, cannot and will not agree. We still get to vote with our 
rifles. You are welcome to believe that we are insane for adopting such a
position, but even if you are right, we're still armed -- doesn't that 
just complicate your problem?</p>

<p>We are resigned to being a despised
minority within our own country, as long as we are a despised and 
FEARED minority whose rights and property are respected.</p>

<p>You may kill us, but you cannot change our minds.</p>

<p>Kindly,
for all our sakes, remember Bill Clinton's rules of engagement. A civil
war is a two-way shooting gallery. Don't sign your own target.</p>

<p>Just
so we're clear, the way you sign your own target is by voting for any 
bill which commands the government's seizure of power of the private, 
intrastate transfer of arms or for one banning the sales or possession 
of any kinds of heretofore legal weapons or ammunition, or for taxing 
them to death, or for any other combination of measures, official or 
unofficial which lead to the same things. Put your "Yea" on any of 
those, and when innocent Americans get killed by federal forces as a 
result, you will have placed the crosshairs over your own heart.</p>

<p>You have been warned.</p>

<p>If you want to curse anybody, curse Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>It was his idea.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>Mark Volescu spoke first. "Man, you didn't write this."</p>

<p>Steve grinned, "No I didn't. But I did send it."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>Steve told them the name of the author.</p>

<p>"He's dead, dude."</p>

<p>"Maybe. They never did find his body."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Volescu, "but I've read most of his stuff and I never read this."</p>

<p>"Well,
right after we got back and I was discharged, I got on some gun rights 
e-mail lists and one of them was his. Anyway, he sent out a letter like 
this early one morning and then sent out another one a few hours later 
saying it was for review only, and he didn't mean for it to get out, and
to please destroy any copies. He said he wasn't sure he was going to 
send it. Well, he didn't. It was right there at the line of being a 
threat to a federal official, so I guess he was advised by his friends 
not to send it. I never saw or heard anything more about it."</p>

<p>"If an empty threat falls on deaf ears, was it ever really said?" paraphrased Nijima, who was the deep thinker of the team.</p>

<p>"Let me venture a wild-assed guess," offered Volsecu, "you didn't delete your copy."</p>

<p>Avakian looked at his former SF team member and grinned.</p>

<p>"You're quick, Speedo." Volescu just grunted. He hated that nickname.</p>

<p>Steve
continued. "But when I heard he was dead, I changed it a bit, wrapped 
it around a dubbed copy of this scene from Michael Collins and sent it 
to every US Representative and Senator. It put them on notice. Like 
Michael Collins, I had warned them. I'm sure the FBI figured out a dead 
man wrote it, but they musta been scratchin' their heads how he mailed 
it from beyond the grave."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well I noticed it didn't stop 'em from passing anything," Volescu retorted sourly.</p>

<p>"No,"
admitted Avakian, "it didn't. Which is why they've got it coming now. 
There's way too many dead innocents on the ground now NOT to pay them 
back."</p>

<p>The men looked at one another. They loved Steve Avakian 
like a brother, and they knew now why they were here. They'd talked 
about it a hundred times on a theoretical level. And there had been 
worse laws since the Omnibus Crime Bill. People had died resisting them.
There was a low intensity guerrilla conflict going on all over the 
country. The whole state of Alabama looked like it was going to war with
the Feds because the administration had thrown the Constitution out the
window and wouldn't let them run their own affairs.</p>

<p>Carter, Ball
and Twigg had each taken a discharge at the same time as Avakian. 
Volescu followed with a general six months ago by framing himself as a 
security risk. You couldn't get out these days just by claiming you were
a homosexual. "Don't ask, don't tell" had been junked by the new 
administration. Now it was "Hey, brag about it and you'll get promoted."</p>

<p>Nijima
couldn't get released, his MOS was too sensitive, too needed. 
Consequently, Nijima was a deserter. There was a lot of that going 
around these days. CID was camped on his ex-wife's doorstep hoping he 
would surface there. Considering she was a faithless bitch who'd screwed
around on "Nidge" when he was in Kandahar, it wasn't likely. But Nijima
didn't mind them spying on her.</p>

<p>"Hell, Steve, you want us to help you kill the whole Congress?" This from Nijima.</p>

<p>"No,"
said Avakian, "just these people. They're in our AO. I don't want to 
have to operate in DC, it ain't home ground. These are close by." He 
handed the other five men a sheet with 78 names on it.</p>

<p>"There's more than congresscritters on here," observed Mike Ball.</p>

<p>"Yeah,"
explained Avakian, "there's TV talking heads, newspaper editors, U.S. 
Attorneys, supervisory federal policemen, and a grocery list of anti-gun
politicians, local, state and national. I warned them too. Just notes, 
short and sweet: "You have been judged guilty of supporting, soliciting 
or assisting in the use of deadly force to impose a tyrannical scheme of
gun control on the American people. Innocent Americans have died as a 
result. Renounce your opinions, quit your jobs, run and hide now and you
can live. Continue with what you've been doing and you'll be killed as a
legitimate target of war." And I signed it, 'The American Republican 
Army.'"</p>

<p>Steve looked around the room, then continued.</p>

<p>"Priority
goes to the congressmen and senators who voted for the Omnibus Bill and
Operation Clean Sweep. I didn't put just anybody on there. They are all
there because they did some specific act or acts that carried out, or 
gave material assistance to, the unconstitutional operations of the 
administration. It's Clinton's ROE, applied to gun control."</p>

<p>Carter
called out the name of a Hollywood actress, a real loud mouth who 
supported the regime with money and influence. "Hey, what's she on this 
list for?"</p>

<p>Avakian started to tell Carter about why he'd included
her and Carter cut him off. "Yeah I know she's a commie bitch from 
Lesbos and she gave a lot of money to gun-control politicians, but what I
meant was, why's she on OUR target list? She doesn't come from here."</p>

<p>Ball
knew the answer to that one. "You don't watch 'Access Hollywood,' 
shithead. Her new girl-toy is from Lockwood and they got a love nest up 
by the ski resort. Right Steve?"</p>

<p>"You got it."</p>

<p>"She's hot," said Carter.</p>

<p>Ball,
who had aced the LSAT and been accepted at Harvard Law, was mystified. 
"She's a lesbian, Mike, what does it matter to you that she's hot?"</p>

<p>"I know, but she's still hot. I want that job."</p>

<p>"Naw," said Nijima, "that's my job. I still haven't forgiven the bitch for raising money for the Taliban that time."</p>

<p>"Hell, Nidge," said Avakian, "we all want to kill her. We'll have to draw straws."</p>

<p>Twigg
butted in. "How about we do it like some Agatha Christie novel? Like, 
we each shoot her at the same time with a different caliber of weapon? 
Let 'em try to figure that out."</p>

<p>They all jeered. "Agatha 
Christie?" groaned Avakian, "God, Twigg, you're a f-ckin' idiot." Nijima
agreed and threw a couch cushion at him.</p>

<p>Willow ignored them and
commented, "You know, you kill her and Hollywood's gonna empty out like
a bunch of illegals out the back door of a bodega when somebody yells 
'La Migra!' in the front. There won't be a Hollywood commie left to shop
on Rodeo Drive. They'll all go to the south of France for the 
duration."</p>

<p>"That's what I had in mind, Willow," replied Avakian.</p>

<p>Twigg's
nickname was "Willow," because his first name was Will. Not William, 
not Willie, just Will. Also, because he was short and gutsy like that 
little dwarf character in the movie. His career had shown that his daddy
had chosen his name well. For Will Twigg embodied every meaning of that
word, except last will and testament, and maybe they'd get around to 
that one of these days.</p>

<p>Somebody, a long time ago, had tried 
calling him "Twiggy." The little guy from north Alabama had walked up to
the bigger man, said "I'm sorry you said that," and dumped the bigger 
man's ass in the dirt so fast that nobody quite knew how he'd done it.</p>

<p>He
then apologized, and offered the man a hand up. He was a devout 
Christian, and he never, ever cursed. They'd mocked him for it at first,
until they realized he couldn't be angered and he lived what he 
believed. There was no doubt he was brave and he'd proved it too many 
times to recall. A small, compact man, he was stealthy beyond belief in 
the field.</p>

<p>Once, during an FTX back at Bragg, he snuck up to the 
OPFOR commander, a full bird Colonel who'd sent his RTO on some 
dogrobber job. Twigg raised up out of the weeds about 20 feet away with 
his MILES equipped M-4 and announced very softly. "You are my prisoner, 
Sir." The officer started to swear up one side and down the other, and 
Twigg reproved him. "Sir, you don't have to be profane or vulgar just 
because you lost."</p>

<p>That was Willow all over. He'd picked up 
reading Agatha Christie when they had been in the rear at Kabul. He 
bought the complete paperback set in the market. Dog eared when he got 
them, he read the murder mysteries until the covers fell off. How the 
books ever made it to Afghanistan, Avakian had no clue. Neither did 
Twigg. It wasn't a terrible vice for an explosives instructor to have, 
Avakian guessed, but it still was weird. At least he didn't knit in his 
downtime like Volescu, or make grotesque madman sketches like Carter.</p>

<p>He
glanced around the room. Counting me, there's six apostles, not twelve.
And "Willow" Twigg is my Vinny Byrne. Vinny had been the youngest man 
on Collin's "squad." So devout a young Catholic boy that he went to Mass
both before and after his hits, Vinny would always say as he approached
the victim from close range, "May the Lord have mercy on your soul," 
just before he pulled the trigger and blew his brains out.</p>

<p>There 
was no doubt that the Twelve Apostles had struck terror into the heart 
of the British establishment in Ireland. It was Collins' assassination 
campaign that compelled the Brits to seek a truce. Steve Avakian 
intended to do the same to the people who were responsible for this war.</p>

<p>It would be his own Operation Nemesis.</p>

<h4>"I have killed a man but I am not a murderer."</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>When
the war began in 1914 (Soghomon Tehlirian) said, Armenian soldiers, 
including his brother, were recruited into the Turkish army. Early in 
1915, however, most were stripped of all arms and employed as pack 
animals to transport army supplies, after which they were shot. In the 
villages posters announced that everyone had to surrender arms, but the 
Muslims were allowed to keep theirs while Armenians, when they complied,
were charged as revolutionaries and tortured. Churches were desecrated 
and Christian symbols defiled. But these were only the initial moves by 
the Turkish authorities. In May came news that all Armenian schools had 
to be closed and the teachers, together with the community leaders, were
sent to special camps. Shortly thereafter rumors spread that those who 
were taken away had already been killed. They had been given the 
alternative of renouncing Christianity, converting to Islam, and 
assuming Turkish names, but none had. In the months that followed only a
small number of Armenians converted, for survival and to protect their 
families. At the beginning of June an order came... that the entire 
Armenian population should prepare to leave Erzinga. Money and other 
valuables had to be delivered to the Turkish authorities for 
safekeeping. Three days later the Armenian population of around twenty 
thousand was led from the town early in the morning. They were not 
permitted to take goods and personal belongings... The deportees were
formed into a long caravan of five or six columns... Turkish soldiers
and gendarmes were present on all sides. Everyone was very tired... 
On the very first day, members of Tehlirian's family were killed... 
Several gendarmes dragged his sister off and raped her, while another 
split his brother's head with an ax. His mother lay dead nearby, killed,
he thought, by a bullet... Tehlirian suddenly felt a blow to his head
and fell unconscious. He didn't know how long he lay there -- one or 
two days, he thought. When he awoke it was dark, and he felt a great 
weight on his body. To his horror he discovered that the burden was his 
brother's corpse. Tehlirian struggled until he was able to push his 
brother's body aside and stand up. Despite the darkness he could see 
corpses all around him, and he realized that the entire caravan had been
killed. He was the sole survivor, left for dead by the Turks. -- <i>A 
Crime of Vengeance: An Armenian Struggle for Justice by Edward 
Alexander, Free Press, 1991, p. 70</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The
Armenian Genocide by the Turkish Pashas of the old Ottoman Empire in 
1915 killed between a million and a million and a half Armenian 
Christians. It was characterized by the use of massacres and 
deportations involving forced marches without food or water designed to 
lead to the death of the deportees. Although condemned to death by the 
Turkish government that replaced them, most of the plotters -- who had 
killed no one themselves, merely having ordered it done -- escaped at 
the end of the war and settled down into comfortable lives in places 
like Germany.</p>

<p>To deliver justice upon them, the Armenian 
Revolutionary Federation crafted Operation Nemesis, a covert operation 
in the 1920s to assassinate these Turkish masterminds of the Genocide. 
It was named after the Greek goddess of divine retribution, Nemesis.</p>

<p>Hundreds
of the guilty mass murderers were hunted down and executed by the 
assassins of the ARF in the 1920s. All this Steve Avakian knew by heart.
When he was sixteen, his dad had handed him a book called 'A Crime of 
Vengeance', by Edward Alexander.</p>

<p>"You need to know where you came from," he told Steve. "Read this and we'll talk."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now
all eyes turned to the doorway through which entered a shy, nervous 
young man -- the accused Soghomon Tehlirian, seen for the first time by 
representatives of the world press. Clad in a black suit, he calmly 
walked to his place at the defense table. slight of figure and with 
slender features, the youth, though pale, seemed in control of himself. 
Now and then he looked around with what the press would call "the eyes 
of a fanatic," but his demeanor was gentle and restrained... The 
accused was then informed of the official charge against him:</p>

<p>"The
alleged student of mechanical engineering, Soghomon Tehlirian... 
born on April 2, 1897, in Pakaritch, Turkey, a Turkish citizen, Armenian
Protestant... is charged with intentionally having killed the former
Turkish Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha in Charlottenburg on March 15, 1921, 
and of having carried out the killing with premeditation..."</p>

<p>Judge
Lehmberg instructed the interpreters to inform the accused the contents
... of the official charge... when the interpreters had finished, 
Judge Lehmberg turned to the accused: "How do you plead? Would you say 
yes or no to this accusation?"</p>

<p>"No." Defense Attorney von Gordon 
intervened and asked the court: "I request to ask the accused how he 
does not regard himself as guilty."</p>

<p>"I do not regard myself as 
guilty because my conscience is at peace." Judge Lehmberg immediately 
pursued that with a question... "How is your conscience at peace?"</p>

<p>"I have killed a man but I am not a murderer."</p>

<p>-- <i>A Crime of Vengeance, pp. 66-67</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Do you understand the difference?" his father had asked him. Steve was 
quiet for a moment. Finally he said, "Yeah, Dad, I get it. But how come 
no one ever talks about this?" he held up the slim hardback. "I've never
heard of it before, except for stuff I overheard you and grandpa talk 
about before he died, stories about great grandpa Aram, and I didn't 
really understand that. They sure don't teach it in school."</p>

<p>"Well,
your Grandpa wanted to tell you when you were little, but your mother 
wouldn't have any of it. She made me swear not to 'traumatize' you. But 
you're sixteen now. You've got a right to know. A right and a duty."</p>

<p>"A duty?"</p>

<p>"Yes,
son, a duty. The Jews weren't the first people to say, 'Never again.' 
We Armenians were. Hitler used our genocide as a pattern for theirs. And
some Jews used the book "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh" as an inspiration
for last-ditch resistance.  Armenians were prominent in the fight 
against Nazism, and Armenian peasants in the Balkan countries and in 
Russia hid Jews. You see, they knew what it was like. And I want your 
promise that you'll never stand by and watch innocent people victimized 
by a government -- any government, even our own. We Armenians have a duty
to see that it never happens again, no matter what country we live in."</p>

<p>Steve
Avakian had promised. But he never thought America could become such a 
country. He had grown up, joined the army, and seen how the rest of the 
world worked, and through it all he'd never thought that the American 
government could ever become that corrupt, that murderous, to its own 
people. He no longer thought that.</p>

<p>"So," said Volescu, "you got more than a list of names?"</p>

<p>"Yeah,"
replied Steve Avakian, "I do." He started handing out files. "My 
thought was to do the Senators and Congressman first, all within 24 
hours. We begin on a holiday when they're all back in their home 
districts. Then we work our way down the second tier and see how far we 
get."</p>

<p>He paused. "You in?"</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Twigg was the first to reply, "Yeah, I'm in." And then he said simply, by way of explanation, "I took an oath."</p>

<p>They all nodded. So he had. So had they all. One by one they all committed, until only Nijima was left.</p>

<p>"Nidge?" prompted Avakian.</p>

<p>Nijima,
his eyes closed, faked a snore, then an elaborate awakening. "Huh? Oh, 
yeah, what was you wanted me to do? Kill a bunch of evil Death Eaters, 
lesbian traitoresses, crooked government lawyers, pasty faced killer 
bureaucrats and panty waist editorial apologists, right? What's not to 
like?"</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>Nidge continued, "Steve, it wounds me that you even thought you had to ask. I took an oath too, you know."</p>

<p>"Right," replied Avakian. "Sorry."</p>

<p>"So,"
said Volescu, who besides being a champion knitter held a PhD in 
International Relations, "do we tell them who we are? Or are we just 
going to be anonymous?"</p>

<p>"I made up some death cards on my home 
computer. Printed them on card stock. What do you think?" He handed each
team member a card.</p>

<p>"What a babe!" offered Volescu.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Carter,"forget that lezzy bitch, this hottie has WINGS. I want a date with HER. What's her name?"</p>

<p>Steve Avakian smiled.</p>

<p>"Her name," he answered, "is Nemesis."</p>

<p><strong>Thirteen days later</strong></p>

<p>The
problem was, being in a ski resort area where the rich, famous and 
well-connected came to play, they were suffering from an embarrassment 
of riches themselves -- too many juicy targets.  Though many of them 
owned property in the team's area of operations, once Nemesis began 
killing these members of the regime, the rest would scurry beyond reach 
into their green zones far away.</p>

<p>It also made sense to do the 
toughest jobs first.  Three of these hard targets were selected and both
for target availability and for maximum impact it had been decided to 
do them simultaneously if possible.  Normally, the smallest formation 
they would have worked in was two teams of three, each with two 
operators to do the work and a "guardian angel" to watch over them.  A 
third target made that impossible.  And what of all those other worthies
who would flee when the first shot was fired?</p>

<p>Looking at the topo map, it was Carter who solved the three-job problem.</p>

<p>As far as reaching out and touching the refugees, it was Nijima who provided the idea and Willow the means to execute it.</p>

<p>"You're not the only one who's read up on Irish history, Steve," Nijima had said after he told them his idea.</p>

<p>"The problem is," Avakian replied, "we don't have access to enough explosives to do what you propose."</p>

<p>"Aw,
I dunno," drawled Willow, "Why don't you leave that to me?  I think I 
got a way to spread out what little we can get and make it all happen.  
It won't be a loaves and fishes miracle, but it'll work."</p>

<p>Avakian was skeptical.  "How's that?"</p>

<p>So Willow told him, in detail.  </p>

<p>"That's
brilliant!" said Steve.  The rest of the team nodded their heads with 
approval.  Nijima walked over and slapped him on the shoulder.  
"Outstanding, man, outstanding."</p>

<p>"Shucks," responded Willow 
modestly, "Taint nothin' more than they taught us way back when -- 'take 
what the enemy gives you and use it against him.'"</p>

<p>And now, almost two weeks later, they were ready.</p>

<p>The
prey were walking carefully these days, what with all the random 
killings going on all over the country.  They thought they were prudent,
they thought they were safe.  Especially here in snow country, far away
from the battlegrounds of the coasts.</p>

<p>It was true that they had 
made themselves hard targets.  Their homes had been hardened with what 
the experts represented as bullet-proof glass and fool-proof security 
systems.  Fences, gates and doors had been strengthened and armed 
bodyguards hired.  They WERE hard targets.  </p>

<p>It was just that they were wrong about everything else.  For Nemesis was coming to visit.</p>

<p>Stealing
the propane company service truck two states away and repainting it in 
local colors had been tougher than stealing the recoilless rifle and its
ammunition from the ski lodge.</p>

<p>It is a little known fact that 
the U.S. Army has for the past sixty years or so loaned light artillery 
on a semi-permanent basis to the private companies who operate ski 
slopes.  They do this for avalanche control purposes.</p>

<p>Most often 
these are recoilless rifles of 106mm caliber.  Off season, they are kept
under strict lock and key.  Security precautions when they are being 
used are equally tough.  To the team, beneficiaries of some of the 
United States government's best criminal training, it was easy as pie to
lift the weapon, tripod and six rounds of high explosive ammo, along 
with a box of the special fifty caliber rounds for the spotting rifle 
mounted parallel to the recoilless that have the same ballistics as the 
main round.</p>

<p>The M40A1 106mm recoilless rifle is not really 106mm,
but rather 105mm.  The Army added the extra millimeter to distinguish 
the rounds of the M40 from an earlier, unsuccessful recoilless rifle 
design  of 105mm bore.  It measures over 11 feet long and weighs almost 
300 pounds.  The M40 fires a 29 pound round at 1870 feet per second.  
Its maximum effective range for aimed shots is 2 kilometers.  For area 
fire it is almost eight klicks.</p>

<p>Now, the entire assembly was 
mounted on the ass-end of a long-bed pickup truck under a tarp, and the 
truck was backed up, sitting perched as far out as it could go on the 
rim of Lover's Leap, a promontory that was just about equidistant from, 
and had line-of-sight to, the mountain retreats of a certain hollywood 
star with treasonous tendencies and a sitting United States Senator who 
had violated his oath by supporting Operation Clean Sweep.  This was the
spot that Carter had identified on the topo map.</p>

<p>It was ten 
minutes until two o'clock on a Sunday morning.   The tarp was pulled 
off.  The parking brake was set, the wheels were chocked and the springs
were jammed with steel shims to keep the vehicle bed from shifting as 
the long barrel swung from target to target.  Each estate was well lit, 
making targeting simple.</p>

<p> Both targets were abed and asleep.   The star had someone in her bed.  The Senator did not.</p>

<p>"What about the girl-toy, isn't she an innocent?" Willow had asked.  Nijima had an answer for that.</p>

<p>"They
met at the Taliban fundraiser, Will," Nidge said harshly. "She also 
signed the celebrity petition for the ban.  They're both domestic 
enemies."</p>

<p>Willow had shrugged.  "OK, just makin' sure."</p>

<p>"And are we sure about the rest of innocents?  The maids and so on?" Ball asked.</p>

<p>Carter
answered that one.  He had done the recon of the sites with a powerful 
spotting scope and a Simrad laser range finder from the vantage point of
Lover's Leap.</p>

<p>"If the intel we got from open sources is right, 
and I'm sure it is, her bedroom is second-floor northwest corner, so the
rounds, if we put them on target, are going to penetrate wall and 
window facing us and blow out the adjoining wall at an angle away from 
the other rooms.  The Senator's bedroom is north-east on the third 
floor, giving us a similar oblique shot.  Because the outer walls at 
that end of the house are brick, I don't expect the rounds to blow out 
the adjoining wall but rather to be contained in the room.  Better Homes
and Gardens had a photo showing the bedroom with a stone fire place and
chimney on the opposite wall in the bedroom which should help to 
contain the blast to the Senator's personal discomfort.  In any case, 
the hired help are all on the lower floors.  If we hit it dead-on, there
shouldn't be a problem."</p>

<p>"That recoilless is going to 
light up the night," Volescu cautioned.  "We're going to have to make, 
what, two shots minimum on the first target, shift, and fire two more?  
That doesn't count the spotting rounds.  And that position is visible 
from lots of places across the valley and surrounding ridges.  There 
aren't that many routes by which we can exfil.  What if some sheriff's 
deputy on patrol gets there before we can boogie?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, 
Vol," said Avakian, "Willow's going to make sure that they have plenty 
more to look at, and worry about.  My bet is, nobody will be able to 
pick out the recoilless from everything else that's going to be 
happening."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The British are, of course, a
people well practised down the centuries in the use of fire as an 
instrument of terror.  It has been said that they reached the peak of 
perfection in this art in Ireland after the Rising of 1798, but I do not
think this is correct.  Surely they excelled in the war for the 
conquest of South Africa, when they failed to defeat in the field a 
handful of Boer riflemen, but succeeded in forcing their surrender by 
the mass burnings of Boer homesteads and the imprisonment, under 
appalling conditions, of Boer women and children, many thousands of whom
died.  So in 1920 and 1921, the British would use against the Irish the
instrument which was so successful against the Boers, previous 
generations of the Irish and other subject races.  There was, however, 
one all important factor which the British evidently forgot to take into
consideration.  While the South Africans had no British Loyalists' 
homes which could be destroyed as reprisals, Ireland was studded with 
castles, mansions and residences of the British Ascendancy who had made 
their homes here.  The West Cork Brigade was slow to commence a campaign
of counter-burnings, but eventually action was taken.  A note was sent 
to the British Military Commander in west Cork, informing him that for 
every Republican home destroyed from that date, the homes of two British
Loyalists would be burned to the ground.</p>

<p>The British ignored 
this threat and two nights afterwards burned out a small farmhouse and 
labourer's cottage.  The following night the I.R.A. burned out four 
large Loyalists' residences in the same neighbourhood.  The British 
countered by burning four farmhouses and we promptly burned out the 
eight largest Loyalists' homes in that vicinity.  And so the British 
terror and the I.R.A.  counter-terror went on.  Castles, mansions and 
residences were sent up in flames by the I.R.A. immediately after the 
British fire gangs had razed the homes of Irish Republicans.  Our people
were suffering in this competition of terror, but the British loyalists
were paying dearly, the demense walls were tumbling and the British 
Ascendancy was being destroyed.  Our only fear was that, as time went 
on, there would be no more Loyalists' homes to destroy, for we intended 
to go on to the bitter end...</p>

<p>Very soon after our campaign of 
counter-burnings commenced an outcry arose from the British Loyalists 
themselves, demanding that the British forces should cease destroying 
Republican homes, as otherwise they too would be treated likewise... 
British peers in  their House of Lords and members of the House of 
Commons, dyed in the wool Imperialists, who would gladly have destroyed 
the home of every Irish Nationalist, echoed those appeals... This 
outcry had its effect, and although British burnings were never 
officially called off, they were slowed down considerably and even 
halted for a time.  Once again the British had reacted to the only sure 
method of meeting their terrorism, an effective counter-terror.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It was Willow who 
had worked the hardest to set up the multiple strikes.  He thought of it
as preparing the broad canvas upon which the other team members would 
sketch in their smaller, but more vital, contributions.</p>

<p>For all 
of their various locations and security precautions, there was one thing
that all of the targets' homesteads had in common: they were all heated
by propane storage tanks, some underground and some above, but all of 
them filled and serviced regularly by the MountainWest Corporation, 
known as MoWesCo.</p>

<p>With the stolen gas service truck repainted in 
MoWesCo colors and Will Twigg dressed in a company uniform, the 
demolitions expert paid a "pre-season inspection visit" to 15 vacation 
properties belonging to regime supporters.  At the estates where 
security guards or house sitters watched over the property, this was 
accepted as perfectly normal.  At each property, Willow installed a new 
"leak warning system," as he explained it to those who maintained 
residence there, instructing them on the necessity to evacuate the 
premises without delay if, in the wildly unlikely event,  they ever 
heard it.  He reinforced this message with graphic photographs of 
previous propane tank explosions he had downloaded from the Internet at 
the public library in Cantor (where there were no surveillance cameras),
neatly displayed in a MoWesCo three-ring binder he'd picked up at a 
thrift store in Lockwood.  The guards and house-sitters were suitably 
impressed at this extra precaution taken for their safety.</p>

<p>Of course, Willow explained, there would be no charge for this new company service.</p>

<p>He lied.</p>

<p>Now
despite what you have seen in Hollywood action fakeries, propane 
contained in well-maintained tanks is actually rather hard to detonate 
with both reliability and maximum effect.  The best way is to suddenly 
compromise the tank so that the gas leaks out rapidly into a cloud and 
then detonate the cloud with a second charge in a low-order fuel-air 
explosion.  This takes knowledge and experience.  Willow had both.  </p>

<p>It
took him three long days, shuttling about on county roads, to install 
the very visible alarms and the invisible demolitions and their 
triggering mechanisms.  Nowhere did anyone question him about what he 
was doing.  He, like them, was hired help, unimportant and eminently 
ignorable.</p>

<p>Now, at six minutes to H-Hour, Will Twigg pulled a 
cell phone out of his pocket and pushed a speed-dial number.  In fifteen
houses spread out over almost twenty-two square miles, alarms began to 
sound, and frightened people tumbled out of bed, and fled the premises 
as fast as they could go.</p>

<p>Willow gave them five minutes, and 
speed-dialed another number.  You could hear, with various sound levels,
the reports of the cutting charges.  When the first ignition charge 
went off with a distant flash and boom, the recoilless, with Steve 
Avakian as gunner and Will Twigg as loader, fired the first spotting 
round at the Senator's house 1600 meters distant.</p>

<p>Normally, in 
avalanche work, the 106s were fired from enclosures by remote control 
since there had been a few cases of deadly in-tube detonations which had
occurred thanks to defective, over-age ammunition.  Here, the team 
would not have time to use such protection.  The rounds had to be fired 
as swiftly as possible to catch the targets in their beds.  That meant 
risk.  Steve Avakian had briefed them all of the dangers and asked for 
volunteers.  To a man, they all were willing.  Steve chose Willow 
because the firing of the recoilless had to be closely coordinated with 
the detonation of Twigg's charges anyway.  Nidge was in overwatch back 
where the access to Lover's Leap met the county highway.</p>

<p>Spotting
rounds have an incendiary composition in the projectile so that when it
slams into the target the gunner can see the flash and know that he can
fire the main charge and hit within a foot or two.  If, that is, 
everything works right.  The spotting round struck the bricks on the 
outside wall about six feet above Senator Richland Hamilton's head, 
glancing away without much penetration because of the angle, but waking 
him from an erotic dream involving the First Lady of the United States.</p>

<p>"What the hell?!?" he exclaimed as he rolled out of bed, naked as the day his mother brought him into the world.</p>

<p>Avakian
immediately held up his left hand to warn Willow, closed his eyes to 
preserve his night vision and fired the main gun.  Even with double 
hearing protection the explosion of hot gasses out the back of the 
recoilless was painful to the hearing of both men and the concussion 
slammed at the air in their lungs.  The flash would have blinded them 
had they not had their eyes shut.  The broad blast cone blew the windows
out of the pickup truck and inside the seat covers and dash began to 
burn.</p>

<p>A 106 round, even at 1870 feet per second, takes a bit to 
reach a target that is a kilometer and a half away.  Had it been 
daylight and if Senator Hamilton had possessed x-ray vision, he might 
have seen death approaching.</p>

<p>As it wasn't and he couldn't, 
Richland Hamilton was still wondering what to do, and bemused by his 
erection, when the high explosive blew in his bedroom wall and tore off 
the top of his head, as well as other body parts.  The second round that
followed, struck the wall four feet to the left and lower down and 
deposited his mutilated body out the opposite wall's window and left it 
hanging upside down in a tall pine tree.  </p>

<p>This would later complicate the county medical examiner's job.</p>

<p>All
things being more or less equal, the distance between Senator 
Hamilton's death and the sleeping ears of Daisy O'Connell was a little 
over 2 kilometers.  The crack of the spotting round didn't wake her up. 
The reverberating "boom... BOOM!" of the first round did, despite 
the sleeping pill she had taken.  By the time the second round blew the 
remains of Richland Hamilton out his window, both she and Felicia were 
moving toward their own double-reinforced bullet-resistant window.</p>

<p>As
the big recoilless rifle swung toward them in the darkness beyond the 
illumination of the lodge's exterior lights, they stared out the window 
toward the fires that were licking out from the holes in Senator 
Hamilton's bedroom walls.</p>

<p>Steve Avakian saw them through the 
sight in the reflected yard lights.  Fearing they might figure out what 
was about to happen to them and knowing that the range was almost 
identical to his first two shots, he dispensed with the spotting round. 
</p>

<p>Up went his left hand, he closed his eyes, and pulled the 
trigger.  The backblast flash got Felicia's attention, and she pointed, 
exclaiming "What was tha..."</p>

<p>The 106 projectile hit the "bullet-proof" window's bottom ledge, about four feet to the couple's left.</p>

<p>Given the angle and the proximity of the explosion, there was no need for a second shot.</p>

<p>Which
was a good thing, because the cab of the pickup was now well enveloped 
in flames.  So, too, was much of the nearby brush.  There was nothing to
do but leave, which they did, driving away in the propane company truck
down the road with flames on both sides.  They paused only long enough 
to pick up Nijima at the junction, and then they proceeded as if nothing
had happened, and drove to the rally point.</p>

<p>Carter, Ball and 
Volescu had the easiest assignment.  Congressman Haynes' chalet was 
further down the ridge from two of Willow's propane jobs.  When the 
warning horns began to sound, they woke up the Congressman and his wife,
who came out on their back deck just in time to see both estates blown 
to smithereens.  At that moment, Volescu, who was sitting in a hide with
Ball as his spotter about 725 meters away, put a .338 Lapua Magnum 
bullet just above his sternum.  His wife was convinced that a piece of 
shrapnel from one of the nearby explosions must have killed her husband.
 The coroner didn't think so, and the autopsy proved his suspicions had
been correct.</p>

<p>By the next morning, two newspaper editors, 
another congressman and three supervisory employees of the ATF and FBI 
were dead.  People identified with the administration, gun control and 
especially Operation Clean Sweep continued to die with regularity over a
period of about five weeks.  By that time, everyone on Steve Avakian's 
list was dead or had fled the team's area of operations.</p>

<p>At two 
that afternoon, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation flew
in to get a personal briefing on the death of Senator Hamilton.  At 
4:52PM, while he was touring the senator's ravaged estate with a bevy of
press, someone shot the Director through his body armor with a .50 
caliber Barrett bolt-action rifle from 1205 meters away. </p>

<p>Even experts said it was an impossible shot.</p>

<p>He died at the Lockwood City Hospital two hours later.</p>

<p>It
took the FBI two days to find the sniper's hide.  As with the other 
crime scenes, there was little forensic evidence to identify the 
perpetrators.</p>

<p>His killer was never identified, and in time the 
Director became just another statistic of the latest American civil war 
that the administration he served had done its best to start.</p>

<p>The only thing that tied all the cases together was an image found at, or mailed to, the address of each victim.</p>

<p>It
was a death card with the classical painting of a Greek goddess on it 
-- Nemesis, the avenger of crime and the punisher of hubris.

<p>"It
was inevitable that the administration would turn to what they called 
'private contractors' after the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
and subordinate military commanders informed the President that the Army
and Marines would be unreliable to carry out Operation Clean Sweep. 
Even the wholesale replacement of senior officers in the Pentagon could 
not induce the majority of U.S. soldiers to enforce the draconian laws 
passed after the Battle of Sipsey Street. The administration came to 
realize that the most they could count on was that the military would 
stay on the sidelines and not turn on THEM as "domestic enemies" of the 
Constitution... Using 'contractors' however had other benefits. 
They could (and would) be used by the administration for the 'plausible 
deniability' of some actions against the rebels and their families which
were not even covered by the new laws. In addition, from a 
bureaucratic point of view, the means of their procurement was familiar 
and time-tested. Finally, using 'contractors' enabled the 
administration to hire men who were, frankly, criminals -- men who could
never have passed the background checks required for the military or 
federal law enforcement. Absent the Army and Marines, the 
administration desperately needed bodies to carry out Operation Clean 
Sweep. The 'contractors' made that possible, or so it was thought." --

<h4>Air Tractor</h4>

<p>Stealing
the plane had been the easy part. It wasn't even stolen, really, just 
borrowed from a friend. Not that Joe Cornyn expected to be able to 
return it back to Charlie Carter in one piece. He had been lucky, he 
knew, for C.C.'s misfortune. Well, it was an ill wind that blew no one 
any good and Joe had been the beneficiary of C.C.'s bankruptcy. Fuel 
costs had become prohibitive. No farmer could afford to pay what C.C. 
had to charge for cropdusting nowadays. So Charlie had shuttered his 
office and hanger, laid off his employees and sold off all of his 
company assets, save this plane, his best.</p>

<p>Even the hanger 
had been Joe's for the using while he modified the crop duster for the 
job. Even that hadn't been the tough part, although his hands, unused 
to metal fabrication and machine work, looked like it was. No, the 
tough part had been working out the details of the weapon he intended to
deploy. He read crop dusting manuals (which were written with all the 
clear meaning and exciting prose of Chinese DVD instructions) until the 
data ran out his ears.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Remember the
speed of the aircraft changes the droplet spectrum. The optimum droplet
spectrum can generally be developed by selecting the appropriate setup 
configuration. Remember turbine powered, faster aircraft, generally 
have more uniform patterns. The droplet spectrum may be the most 
important aspect of these applications and should be carefully adjusted 
with nozzle selection, operating pressure and mounting configuration...
 Remember small changes in droplet diameter make big changes in droplet
volume! (Example: It takes (1.6) 300µ droplets to equal 1 350µ droplet 
and 2.4 300µ droplets to equal 1 400µ... . Remember there are 
excellent aerial models available to help determine the expected droplet
spectrum... Remember... Remember..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember?
Joe remembered that crap in his sleep. He wouldn't likely forget it 
this side of the grave. Which, he reflected, might not be that long 
from now anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The AT-802/802A is 
the world's largest single engine aircraft, and its popularity reflects 
the industry's trend to larger, high-production turbine equipment. With a
payload of 9,500 lbs, the AT-802A provides more working capacity than 
any other single-engine ag plane. Its power, speed and payload delivers 
large operation efficiencies and opens up new income opportunities." --
<i>from the Air Tractor sales brochure</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leland
Snow sure knew how to build an airplane. The Air Tractor 802A that 
vibrated under Joe Cornyn's finger tips was BIG. Its Pratt &amp; 
Whitney PT6A-65AG turbine engine generated 1,295 horsepower at 1,700 RPM
and the five bladed prop just clawed the heavy plane through the sky 
effortlessly. With a span of almost 60 feet, its big rectangular wings 
had an area of 401 square feet. Of course, it had to be for the payload 
it was designed to carry. This was no Piper Cub. As a matter of fact, 
taking off in a fully loaded cropduster was like trying to get a 
wallowing B-17F loaded with 500 pound bombs off the ground. Anybody who
jumped into a tanked-up Air Tractor expecting it to perform like any 
other single-engine light plane would end up as the main course in a 
combination barbeque and celestial dirt nap at the end of the runway. 
Some one once compared it to the difference between handling a nimble 
sports car versus a fully loaded Peterbilt semi. Pilots of crop dusters
are required to have a one-year apprenticeship to learn how to operate 
and fly the aircraft safely. Fortunately for Joe, Charlie had given him
some familiarization time in the Air Tractor back when Cornyn had toyed
with the idea of getting his crop duster certificate. He'd never 
followed it up, but he wasn't at a loss to fly the single-engine bomber 
which was what the Air Tractor was now, as he headed east to the target 
which lay ahead in the gathering dawn.</p>

<h4>"Come out you Black and Tans"</h4>

<p>And as he flew nap of the earth, Joe Cornyn began to sing a song his grandda had taught him long before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was born on a Dublin street where the Loyal drums did beat<br/>
And the loving English feet walked all over us,<br/>
And every single night when me father'd come home tight<br/>
He'd invite the neighbors outside with this chorus:</p>

<p>Oh, come out you black and tans,<br/>
Come out and fight me like a man<br/>
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders<br/>
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away,<br/>
From the green and lovely lanes in Killeshandra.</p>

<p>Come tell us how you slew<br/>
Them ol' Arabs two by two<br/>
Like the Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows,<br/>
How you bravely faced each one<br/>
With your sixteen pounder gun<br/>
And you frightened them damn natives to their marrow.</p>

<p>Oh, come out you black and tans,<br/>
Come out and fight me like a man... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe
laughed loud enough to be heard over the Pratt and Whitney, although it
was a single-seater and no one but God heard him. His grandda would 
understand what he was about to do this day, for little Michael Florence
Cornyn had been there when, with his father off fighting with the IRA 
Volunteers, the Tans had beaten his older brother half to death and 
attempted the rape of his mother. Young Michael Cornyn, all of twelve 
years old, had fetched the Webley revolver from its hiding place and 
killed his mother's attacker. And when the would-be rapist's two 
friends ran up the stairs to see what had happened, Michael Cornyn shot 
them too. His marksmanship could have been better, though, for his twin
sister Mary had to finish one of them off with the butcher knife from 
the kitchen. Eventually, the Cornyns made their way to America, and 
they raised their children with an Irishman's memories of the courageous
Volunteers and the vicious Black and Tans, taught through the songs of 
Irish freedom.</p>

<p>He didn't even had to lie to Carter about what he 
was going to do. Charlie had gone and got himself busted by the Feds 
for violating the new "contempt of authority" statute while protesting 
the disappearance of his son Jim into the maw of the new tyranny. C.C. 
was even now spending 90 days in the federal lockup in Richmond. At 
least Charlie would have an alibi for what was about to happen. Not 
that it would matter. If Joe hurt Brightfire one tenth of what he hoped
to, he was sure his friend's life would be forfeit too. He had removed
every ID number and casting or stamping code from the aircraft he could
find, but he was afraid federal forensics would still find something 
that could use to tie the plane to Charlie. Once identified, Brightfire
would make C.C. very slowly, very painfully, dead.</p>

<p>Brightfire. 
If the devil was abroad in the land, and Joe Cornyn was sure that he 
was, then the mercenaries of Brightfire were Beelzebub's familiar demons
and imps. And Joseph Michael Collins Cornyn intended to introduce as 
many of them as he could to their master this day. Joe sang lustily,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The day is coming fast<br/>
And the time is here at last,<br/>
When each yeoman will be cast aside before us,<br/>
And if there be a need<br/>
Sure my kids will sing, "Godspeed!"<br/>
With a bar or two of Stephen Behan's chorus</p>

<p>Oh, come out you black and tans,<br/>
Come out and fight me like a man...</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Brightfire</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Brightfire
International -- Founded in 1985, this private security company 
specializing in "security, stability and peace-keeping operations" 
became a multi-billion dollar enterprise by providing "private 
contractors" to the U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq 
after 11 September 2001. The largest single employer in southeast 
Virginia by the time of the withdrawal of American troops from those 
conflicts, Brightfire began to utilized for domestic security 
operations, especially intelligence gathering, in the period immediately
preceding the civil conflict which began with the Battle of Sipsey 
Street. (See also Phillip Gordon, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives, "Dirty War," Winston County, Alabama, Operation Clean 
Sweep, Restoration War, Mercenaries, and War Crimes Trials, United 
States).</p>

<p>Although Brightfire was not the only private security 
company to provide "mercenaries" to Operation Clean Sweep, they were the
largest, the best known, and it must be said, the most ruthless of such
companies employed by the U.S. government in the attempt to disarm its 
own people.</p>

<p>From its base on 10,000 acres in rural southeastern 
Virginia, at the height of its operations early in the Restoration War, 
Brightfire trained tens of thousands of its own "contract operators" as 
well as federal police recruits at the world's largest privately owned 
weapons training facility. Through its Executive Air subsidiary, 
Brightfire provided cargo and tactical pilots and aircraft to the 
federal effort, eventually acquiring its own tactical air force to 
provide close air support to Operation Clean Sweep when the US Air Force
proved unwilling to do so. (See, "Chillicothe, Ohio: The American 
Guernica," George Wilson, Journal of American Military History, Vol. 66,
No.1, 2027.) Brightfire also produced its own remotely piloted 
vehicles, fixed wing and blimp, as well as armored vehicles.</p>

<p>Ironically,
the Democrat party politicians who were so loud in denouncing 
Brightfire when it was supporting American military operations overseas,
overnight became the company's greatest defenders when it was used 
within the continental United States in Operation Clean Sweep.</p>

<h4>Chillicothe</h4>

<p>The
personal last straw for Joe had been Chillicothe. The Black and Tans...
Joe caught himself. No, the Brightfire thugs. Anyway, whatever 
you called them, or they called themselves, the murdering bastards had 
tried to take down an illegal political meeting in the southern Ohio 
town. The local cops had a security detail there, just to keep order. 
Nobody expected a Brightfire attack. They got one, and the Chillicothe 
police made the mistake of trying to talk them out of it. In the wink 
of an eye, there were six dead cops on the ground and Brightfire was 
shooting in all directions, killing men, women and kids. The county 
sheriff stepped in, and with his deputies, what was left of the 
Chillicothe police and reinforced by several local militias, 
counterattacked and hemmed the Brightfire murderers into a warehouse on 
the river. And Brightfire called down destruction from above. When it 
was over half of downtown was a burnt out shell. The Feds suppressed 
the number of civilian casualties, but best estimates said it was over a
thousand dead. The government had a firm censor's grip on the media 
and the internet now, so no one knew for sure, but that's what the 
Resistance Radio reported when it wasn't being jammed and they were 
known for being more accurate than the government mouthpieces of the 
"main stream media."</p>

<p>Joe didn't have any relatives he knew in 
Chillicothe. His family had not been victimized by the Feds yet. The 
only friend he had who'd run afoul of them was C.C. and was a 90 day 
jail term worth avenging by the mass slaughter he intended to inflict on
Brightfire this morning? Maybe not. But Chillicothe was. Chillicothe
offended him as only a free man can be offended when he sees innocents 
slaughtered. He wasn't a spectator in this war. He was an American 
citizen. And his Irish blood wouldn't let him sit still while others 
died. The Sassenach, as his old grandda called them, needed to be paid 
back. And Joe Cornyn knew how.</p>

<h4>FAE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>"For vapor cloud explosion there is a minimum ratio of fuel vapor to air 
below which ignition will not occur. Alternately, there is also a 
maximum ratio of fuel vapor to air, at which ignition will not occur. 
These limits are termed the lower and upper explosive limits. For 
gasoline vapor, the explosive range is from 1.3 to 6.0% vapor to air, 
and for methane this range is 5 to 15%. Many parameters contribute to 
the potential damage from a vapor cloud explosion, including the mass 
and type of material released, the strength of ignition source, the 
nature of the release event (e.g., turbulent jet release), and 
turbulence induced in the cloud (e.g., from ambient obstructions)... 
The blast effects from vapor cloud explosions are determined not only by
the amount of fuel, but more importantly by the combustion mode of the 
cloud. Significant overpressures can be generated by both detonations 
and deflagrations. Most vapor cloud explosions are deflagrations, not 
detonations. Flame speed of a deflagration is subsonic, with flame speed
increasing in restricted areas and decreasing in open areas. 
Significantly, a detonation is supersonic, and will proceed through 
almost all of the available flammable vapor at the detonation reaction 
rate. This creates far more severe peak over-pressures and much higher 
amounts of blast energy. The speed of the flame front movement is 
directly proportional to the amount of blast over-pressure. A wide 
spectrum of flame speeds may result from flame acceleration under 
various conditions. High flame front speeds and resulting high blast 
over pressures are seen in accidental vapor cloud explosions where there
is a significant amount of confinement and congestion that limits flame
front expansion and increases flame turbulence. These conditions are 
evidently more difficult to achieve in the unconfined environment in 
which military fuel-air explosives are intended to operate... The peak
overpressure and duration are used to calculate the impulse from shock 
waves. Even some advanced explosion models ignore the effects of blast 
wave reflection off structures, which can produce misleading results 
over- or under-estimating the vulnerability of a structure. 
Sophisticated software used to produce three-dimensional models of the 
effects of vapor cloud explosions allows the evaluation of damage 
experienced by each structure within a facility as a result of a primary
explosion and any accompanying secondary explosions produced by vapor 
clouds." -- <i>"Fuel - Air Explosives,"

<p>Years
before, when Joe had been in Army aviation flying fixed wing aircraft, 
he had seen a GBU-43/B tested. They called it the "Mother of All Bombs"
for a reason. Cornyn had been awestruck. It was like a nuke without 
the radiation. He'd walked the ground afterward. Everything beneath it
was broken or turned inside out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fuel-air
weapons work by initially detonating a scattering charge within a bomb,
rocket or grenade warhead. The warhead contents, which are composed of 
either volatile gases, liquids or finely powdered explosives, form an 
aerosol cloud. This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball 
sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area. The 
lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure. This overpressure, or 
blast wave, is the primary casualty-producing force. In several dozen 
microseconds, the pressure at the center of the explosion can reach 30 
kilograms per square centimeter (427 pounds per square inch) -- normal 
atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 pounds per square inch with a 
temperature between 2,500-3,000 degrees Centigrade [4,532-5,432 degrees 
Fahrenheit]. This is 1.5 to 2 times greater than the overpressure caused
by conventional explosives. Personnel under the cloud are literally 
crushed to death. Outside the cloud area, the blast wave travels at some
3,000 meters per second [9843 feet per second]. The resultant vacuum 
pulls in loose objects to fill the void. As a result, a fuel-air 
explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without 
residual radiation. Since a fuel-air mixture flows easily into any 
cavities, neither natural terrain features nor non-hermetically sealed 
field fortifications (emplacements, covered slit trenches, bunkers) 
protect against the effects of fuel-air explosives. -- <i>Lester Grau 
&amp; Timothy Smith, "A 'Crushing' Victory: Fuel-Air Explosives and 
Grozny 2000," Marine Corps Gazette, August, 2000.</i></p>

<p>Now
Joe didn't have a C-130, or a bomb casing the size of a pickup truck, 
or military grade RDX explosive as a burster to distribute the fuel. 
What Joe had was a big-ass crop duster and, thanks to another buddy now 
retired from NHRA racing, 800 gallons of a fifty-fifty mix of 
nitro-methane and propylene oxide fuel in the poly-coated spray tank. 
The mix was determined mostly by what "Crash" Carlyle had on hand. It 
would have to do.</p>

<p>In military terms, he had a huge flying molotov
cocktail. Whether it detonated or merely rained fire down on those 
mercenary assholes would be a tricky question at best, dependent upon 
weather, if he had guessed right about the micron size of the nozzles 
dispensing the fuel, whether the computer models he had used were right,
and if (and he was afraid it was a big "if") his improvised ignition 
system would work.</p>

<p>He knew he'd have to have a day that was 
cool enough to keep the fuel mix from boiling and one with little or no 
wind, and if the forecasters were right (were they ever?) this would be 
it. It had better be, he'd waited two weeks for it. He had debated 
about doing this at night, under a full moon or a maybe "smuggler's 
moon." Finally he chose dawn, first because he could take advantage of 
the cool night on the inbound flight to target, second, because he knew 
he had to see the cloud as he dispensed it and third because he had 
another bright idea that, if it were to work, the plane had to be 
visible from the ground.</p>

<p>To increase the confusion, he'd painted 
the aircraft solid black, as the Brightfire planes were, and put company
logos on the tail and wings. He was flying on the deck, using every 
bit of ground clutter he could to confuse the military radars that were 
always working to protect the many defense assets on the east coast. He
had pulled the radio. There was no point in talking to anybody, and he
needed every bit of weight savings he could find. He wouldn't fool 
them if challenged by a flight controller and he would be flying in 
off-limits airspace. What would he say to them anyway, just before he 
struck? The old battle cry of the Irish Volunteers, "Up the Republic!"?
 He could only hope that if they scrambled fighters to shoot him down 
short of his target that the Brightfire colors would confuse them long 
enough for him to do the job.</p>

<h4>NORAD</h4>

<p>"Sir,
we have an unidentified aircraft flying at low altitude headed east 
near the Virginia-North Carolina line. It's not on any authorized 
flight list and it doesn't answer to repeated radio calls." The Air 
Force sergeant paused. The Colonel sat up a little straighter and 
looked at the NCO intently.</p>

<p>"Show me on the display," he 
ordered. The Colonel grunted softly and asked, "Do you have a guess on 
where it's headed? Norfolk, maybe?"</p>

<p>The NCO shook his head. 
"No sir, allowing for it flying around hills, it seems to always return 
to a bee-line for Brightfire, Virginia."</p>

<p>The NCO wasn't sure but he thought the Colonel faintly smiled.</p>

<p>"Shall I scramble fighters to intercept, sir?"</p>

<p>"Brightfire, huh? Any chance its one of theirs?"</p>

<p>"It's not on any of their flight plans, sir, and they know how picky we are about that."</p>

<p>The
Colonel snorted. Last month, a Brightfire attack helicopter chased 
what they claimed was a militia pickup truck onto the Fort Huachuca 
military reservation. When it failed to answer challenges from the base
defense force on the ground demanding that it back off, the Army had 
put it in the dirt, killing four Brightfire employees. The pickup 
truck, if it had ever existed, got clean away. Brightfire had been a 
lot more respectful of the chain of command since then.</p>

<p>"How far out from Brightfire is it, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Sir, it's flying pretty slow. I'd guess about ten minutes."</p>

<p>"And how long will it take for an F-16 to intercept?"</p>

<p> "Sir, about 10 to 12 minutes."</p>

<p>"Well, Sergeant, it seems like a moot point then, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the sergeant hesitated. "Shall I give Brightfire a call, sir?"</p>

<p>The
Colonel considered that for a moment. He and the sergeant had been 
together for a while, but could he trust him with the truth? The 
Colonel decided he could.</p>

<p>"No, sergeant, let's just sit back and enjoy the show."</p>

<p>With a broad grin, the sergeant said, "Yes, sir!" and went back to his screen.</p>

<p>The
Colonel, who had his own reasons for hating Peter King's mercenary 
thugs that involved a dead son in the 101st Airborne who had been killed
in an Iraqi province stirred up by Brightfire cowboy misbehavior, 
leaned back in his chair and prayed silently, "Lord, please let this be 
what I think it is."</p>

<h4>Stone</h4>

<p>Bill
Duryea was known for his ability to remain motionless longer than 
seemed humanly possible. His nickname among the members of his militia 
reconnaissance team was "Stone," and not just for his ability to be 
deathly still for long periods of time. Even so, he'd had just about 
enough of this hide he'd shared with Willie Crawford for the past week. 
The place stank of body odor, and even the buried urine and feces could
be detected by Bill's sensitive nose. A patrol dog would have no 
trouble pointing them out if one of the random sweeps that came through 
this area got downwind of them. Still, the hide was just about perfect.
</p>

<p>A natural hole in the earth formed when the root ball of a 
huge old pine pulled out of the ground when the tree fell during a 
hurricane years back, it had been relatively easy to improve it into a 
sleeping area in the back. They made a masked observation slit in 
front, worked craftily into the rotting tree remnants which not only 
shielded them from observation, but made a dandy bullet barrier too. If
need be, they could plug up the slit with natural colored burlap 
sandbags they'd prepared, but of course they'd be trapped. There was no
back exit to this place, although one could be dug with time, now was 
NOT the time. The recon team was there to sneak and peak and their 
ability to do that was about spent.</p>

<p>They'd have to leave tonight 
in any case. Stone had just replaced the batteries in the surveillance 
camera, the ITT laser range-finder and the AN-PVS-14 night vision 
devices with their last sets. They couldn't use the flexible solar 
panel to recharge here, it would be a dead giveaway. In addition to the
battery shortage, they had only one more full disc to store images on. 
But, oh, what they had gathered so far! It was the mother lode of 
practical intel. With what they had, you could plan a raid that had a 
reasonable chance of success. Now all they had to do was wrap up today,
wait for nightfall and exfil out.</p>

<p>The hide was on the military 
crest of a low ridge four hundred yards outside the Brightfire 
compound's main inner gate. It overlooked corporate headquarters, the 
computer data center and the reception/conference building. On the 
backside of the headquarters was the company airport, with the main 
hangers about a quarter mile down the runway to the east. Just past the
tree line on the other side of the runway, the first roofs of the 
training barracks were visible through the pines, perhaps a quarter mile
off. Stone Duryea smiled. Nothing like putting all your eggs in one 
small basket. Everything near and dear to Peter King, CEO of 
Brightfire, was right here within a half-mile. Oh, if we just had a 
suitcase nuke, thought Duryea.</p>

<p>Of course the compound's buildings
were constructed in another age, back before the Second American Civil 
War (or Third, if you counted the Revolution). It was a monument to the
ego of the man who wanted to be able to walk right off his corporate 
jet (or helicopter) and into the back door of his corporate offices. 
Who would have thought that a business, even a security business, might 
one day have to be militarily defended?</p>

<p>Well, Peter King was an 
ex-CIA spook, and he should have thought of it. Unfortunately the 
militia didn't have an air force like Brightfire, so there probably was 
little Peter King had worry about from the air. And this was the inner 
sanctum of a 10,000 acre fortress, scattered with wire, sensors and even
minefields, not mention dogs and beaucoup armed mercenaries. It had 
taken a almost a year of unsuccessful probing of Brightfire's defenses 
before the unit had worked out a chink in its armor, and even then it 
had taken all of Duryea's considerable skills to get them this far 
undetected. This could only be done once, so it had to be done right. 
They had tip-toed along the razor's edge to get here, and they would 
likely have to sprint along it back the way they came. A diversion had 
been arranged with radio clicks by a prearranged code last night. 
Perhaps it would be enough.</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p>Something moved 
noiselessly beside him, and Duryea turned to look into the broad, black 
face of Willie Crawford. "Shift change," Willie whispered and Stone 
Duryea nodded. He loved Willie like the brother he never had. You 
couldn't do this kind of insane stuff and not love your partner like a 
brother and be willing to overlook his idiosyncrasies. If you didn't, 
one of you would kill the other, or do something to get them both 
killed. Bill Duryea swore there were times that they could read each 
other's minds.</p>

<p>A question formed in Willie's eyes. Yeah, 
Duryea nodded silently, he heard it too. A deep-throated buzzing, 
growing louder, behind them, coming in from the west. They both moved 
toward the slit.</p>

<h4>"Up the Republic!"</h4>

<p>Even 
before the AT802A cleared the tallest trees on the last major hill 
before Brightfire, he knew he was dead-on target from the navigational 
markers he had jotted on his clipboard. He knew he would see the 
buildings at the front gate, but he also knew he wanted a body count in 
retribution for Chillicothe. So instead of aiming for the corporate 
headquarters and surrounding buildings he made straight across the 
runway for the training barracks. Huge long low buildings, row upon 
row, they were said to be able to hold 10,000 men while they trained 
away at being bloodthirsty killers of American citizens.</p>

<p>As he 
buzzed the headquarters and the airfield he threw one, then another, 
little box with a small parachute attached. They had no sooner left his
hand when they began a warbling wail that every American soldier knew 
was the signature sound of a Chemical-Biological attack sensor. The few
folks who were out and about froze, then ran to get inside. As he 
gained altitude over the barracks, he tossed out more with the same 
result. He was low enough still to see men's mouths working soundlessly,
"Gas! Gas! Gas!"</p>

<p>OK, now you've seen me, watch this, Cornyn 
thought. He had done a lot of gaming for this moment. How fast? How 
high to start with the bottom layer? How many passes to get rid of 800 
gallons? Was he right about the droplet size? Would he live? Don't 
think! His mind screamed at him. Do!</p>

<p>The buildings were 
actually longer and wider than he had planned, so he made his initial 
run higher than he thought he might. Out came the fuel, brilliant 
purple in the dawn's sunlight. He'd put inert dye in to enable him to 
spot the cloud. Of course, this made it more visible to the mercenaries
on the ground, too. And between the sight of the purple cloud, the 
cropduster and the gas alarms, they drew the immediate wrong conclusion:
this was a chemical or biological attack. Their only hope was to get 
inside and tape up those barracks. No way would Brightfire have issued 
MOPP suits to their trainees. So as much as the scurrying men below 
wanted more protection, they just knew that to run without a mask and 
suit was death. So they did what Joe Cornyn wanted them to do. They 
ran inside their thin-walled barracks.</p>

<p>One pass, then another. 
The propwash disturbed the cloud in some places, mended it in others. It
was drifting lower, lower. Joe became aware he was singing another 
song his grandda had taught him, the battle hymn of the Irish Republican
Army, and he was singing it in Gaelic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann <br/>
Seo dhibh a ch&aacute;irde duan &Oacute;glaigh, <br/>
Cathr&eacute;imeach briomhar ceolmhar, <br/>
&Aacute;r dtinte cnamh go buacach t&aacute;id, <br/>
'S an sp&eacute;ir go min r&eacute;altogach <br/>
Is fonnmhar faobhrach sinn chun gleo <br/>
'S go ti&uacute;nmhar gl&eacute; roimh th&iacute;ocht do'n l&oacute; <br/>
Fa ci&uacute;nas chaomh na hoiche ar seol: <br/>
Seo libh cana&iacute;dh Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann</p>

<p>We'll sing a song, a soldier's song,<br/>
With cheering rousing chorus,<br/>
As round our blazing fires we throng,<br/>
The starry heavens o'er us; <br/>
Impatient for the coming fight, <br/>
And as we wait the morning's light, <br/>
Here in the silence of the night, <br/>
We'll chant a soldier's song.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And
then the tank was empty. 800 gallons gone that fast!?! Joe pulled 
back on the stick, turbine and prop screaming, clawing for altitude 
above the cloud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sinne Fi&aacute;nna F&aacute;il <br/>
At&aacute; f&eacute; gheall ag &Eacute;irinn, <br/>
Buidhean d&aacute;r sluagh tar t&uacute;inn do r&aacute;inig chughainn, <br/>

<p>Soldiers are we whose lives are pledged to Ireland; <br/>
Some have come from a land beyond the wave.<br/>
Sworn to be free, No more our ancient sire land <br/>
Shall shelter the despot or the slave. <br/>
Tonight we man the gap of danger In Erin's cause, <br/>
come woe or weal 'Mid cannons' roar and rifles peal, <br/>
We'll chant a soldier's song.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe's
intention had been to get high enough above the cloud, fire the star 
cluster rockets attached to the wings, and keep on going, presenting his
tail to the blast and hope he had enough altitude to trade if he 
stalled out. He saw now that it would be impossible to make sure of the
detonation. "Jesus, Mary and Joseph and all the saints be with me," 
Joe breathed a prayer, and pulled the trigger on the star clusters.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When
the gas alarms started going off, Stone Duryea leaped to the rear of 
the hide and broke out the M-40 gas masks for the both of them. They 
always carried them and two CS grenades apiece in case they needed them 
to break contact with a pursuing foe that was unlikely to be carrying 
such protection themselves.</p>

<p>For the same reason, they also 
carried two M49A1 trip flares each to use as hand grenades to throw 
behind as they didi'ed away at night, blinding any pursuers and their 
night vision. They were careful men, which was why they were still 
alive.</p>

<p>But of the two scouts, Willie Crawford had the greater 
presence of mind this day. He pushed the surveillance camera to the 
front of the slit, set it on continuous wide-angle and only then did he 
put his mask on. Below them, no one was visible outside the buildings. 
When they saw the purple cloud growing over the barracks, they snugged 
their masks a little tighter, but Duryea spoke through the voicemitter 
on his mask, "We're upwind, I think." Crawford just grunted. He hadn't
noticed any breeze.</p>

<p>But when Stone Duryea and Willie Crawford 
saw the star clusters fall toward the cloud, they instantly knew what 
was about to happen. No time to retrieve the camera at the front of the
slit, they packed sandbags in behind it as fast as they could. Willie 
shouted through the mask, "Cover your ears and open your mouth." Duryea
did, and then the world came apart.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Joseph Michael 
Collins Cornyn had wanted to survive this attack if he could. He 
didn't. He also wanted a detonation and not a deflagration of the fuel
air cloud. In that, he got what he wanted. And in the getting, he 
paid the Black and Tans back for Chillicothe almost five times over. He
not only got the barracks, but the airfield, the corporate headquarters
and the computer center also were wrecked and secondary explosions of 
fuel pumps, vehicle and aircraft fuel tanks and utilities finished the 
job. In all 4,248 mercenaries were killed outright. 732 were wounded, 
but many of them died subsequently. It is difficult for the doctors to 
put you back together once you are turned inside out by concussion. </p>

<p>It
was the greatest single blow struck by the resistance against the 
forces of the administration, and it made government recruiting dwindle 
to almost nothing. Most analysts figured the war would now be decided 
by the forces in the field, unless the military decided to jump in on 
the government's side or, it increasingly seemed possible, perhaps on 
the side of the resistance.</p>

<p>Indeed, the damage to the 
government's morale was so great, that they might have tried to hide the
butcher's bill if it hadn't been for Willie Crawford's camera. Of 
course the camera didn't survive the blast, but the disc did. So did 
Willie and Stone Duryea, who had no trouble exfiltrating out of the 
Brightfire compound's shredded defenses with the greatest piece of 
combat footage of the entire Restoration War. It was a good thing that 
they could read each other's mind, because after that they were both 
slightly hard of hearing.</p>

<p>The government never did figure out who
had carried out the FAE strike on Brightfire. Joe Cornyn and his plane
were blown into so many pieces over such a large area of Virginia peat 
bog that reconstructing the forensic evidence was impossible. </p>

<p>Charlie
Carter was released at the end of 90 days from the detention block in 
Richmond and came home to an empty airplane hangar and a cryptic goodbye
note from Joe Cornyn.  It ended with his signature and a P.S., "Up the 
Republic!"

<span style="font-style:italic;">
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Question: "What's ten thousand lawyers at the bottom of the sea?"</p>

<p>Answer: "A good start." – An old lawyer joke.
<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Untouchable.</span></p>

<p>William T. "Little Willy" McCann looked at a face he thought was handsome in the mirror and reflected through the steam and shaving cream that life was good.  Of course, he wasn't aware that his nickname in the ATF Chief Counsel's Office secretarial pool was "Little Willy," and would have been outraged had he known it.  He had earned it, though, by virtue of his wandering eye, unwelcome exploring hands and a certain physical insufficiency – duly reported by those who succumbed (usually just once) to his advances -- that he more than made up for with his out-sized ego.</p>

<p>In the arrogance of his ignorance, William McCann was certain that he had arrived at his deserved station in life by hard work and sheer brilliance.  He had been a middling law student.  Well, maybe less than middling if his transcript was to be believed, and he had been passed over upon graduation when the law firm offers were handed out.  The closest he would get to private practice – and the astronomical income possibilities which were possible in that rarefied atmosphere – was a John Grisham novel.  </p>

<p>But when he found himself after the bar exam without good prospects he did what many other unaccomplished and unpromising young lawyers did: he joined the ranks of the swarms of other worker bee attorneys who toiled in the federal bureaucracy.</p>

<p>For William McCann had two insights early on that had served him well.  The first was that the coin of the realm in Washington, D.C. was power and it could be just as intoxicating as money to the right sort of man.  It was for this reason that he had chosen the ATF, an enforcement agency, as his vehicle.  </p>

<p>The ATF had been since its founding pretty much a law unto itself, thanks to the political cover automatically granted it by anti-firearm politicos of the Democrat party.  If they stood in the shadow of the FBI (and were scorned and ridiculed by it), that was irksome to McCann, but ultimately OK by him.</p>

<p>Working for the FBI would have been beyond his competence (which he understood in an unconscious way that never got in the way of his waking ego) and was, in his estimation, too much like work and too fraught with possibilities of accountability.  And if there was one thing government lawyers like McCann enjoyed, it was the unaccountability of their power.</p>

<p>There were many times over the years when operations that had been approved by the Chief Counsel's Office – signed off on by William McCann -- had gone south.  Street agents were always held accountable for the blow-back, never the attorneys.  Never, reflected McCann with a smile at his mug in the mirror, HIM.</p>

<p>Take the Phil Gordon disaster.  The supervisory agents who had asked for approval were all dead now, taking the blame for that stupendous screw-up with them to their graves.  But McCann, who had given the legal go signal?  Why William T. McCann had every expectation of making Chief Counsel someday.</p>

<p>Part of this was because the agency had suffered for years under a series of short-term or acting directors.  And as they came and went, who provided the answers to all their stupid questions?  Who provided the institutional memory to the policymakers?  Why the lawyers, of course.  And if their version of the institutional memory was self-serving and personally aggrandizing and empowering, why that was their due for simple longevity, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Over the decades the Chief Counsel's Office had extended its reach throughout the agency, until by the time of the Gordon raid they had a representative (or two or ten) in every ATF local office, no matter how inconsequential.  This was viewed by their rotating superiors as prudent, since it was expected that the lawyers would surely act as a cautionary brake on the "cowboy" street agents.</p>

<p>The truth was, McCann understood, that the Chief Counsel's Office ran the agency for all intents and purposes and yet they never suffered when operations turned into epochal failures or spectacular embarrassments.</p>

<p>McCann's second insight was that nothing, NOTHING, happened in the Capitol or the country without lawyers.  The laws were written by hundreds of elected lawyers, approved by dozens of appointed lawyers in robes, and enforced by ten thousand or so anonymous, faceless lawyers just like himself.</p>

<p>Without the lawyers, the federal leviathan would grind to halt.  We are the new priesthood, McCann thought, regurgitating without attribution a thought that had been planted in his head by one of his forgotten professors in law school.</p>

<p>First we define the sin in a way that only the elect can interpret, then some of us act as inquisitors while others defend the malefactor before the high council.  His fate decided, we dispense salvation, forgiveness, fine or death to the sinners.  And the peasants continue to pay us for the privilege.  The thought of him as a priest made him laugh.  But still, there was something that rang true about the metaphor.</p>

<p>McCann wiped the last of the shaving cream from his cheeks and smiled once more at his favorite person.  Screw Eliot Ness, he thought, WE are the real "Untouchables."</p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">JAG</span></p>

<p>Had Little Willy McCann known what Sam Montrose and Jonathan Thompson were up to that same morning as he shaved in his almost-mansion in Arlington, he would have been a bit less certain about that, even though they, like him, were both attorneys.</p>

<p>After Jon Thompson opened the conversation, the two Starbucks coffees went untouched.</p>

<p>For a good long moment, Sam Montrose, a small, neat, compact man with piercing gray eyes and close-cropped brown hair, merely stared at his friend and law partner.</p>

<p>Big Jon Thompson, tall, built like the college linebacker that he had been, finally could not stand the silence.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think?"</p>

<p>The older man grunted.  Finally, he said, "I think you want to get us both very dead before our time."</p>

<p>"Yeah?  So?" challenged Jon Thompson.  "It's not like they don't have it coming.  The country is dying, drowning in their ocean of shit and they just float idly by, watching the rest of us from their palatial houseboat ark."</p>

<p>Montrose smiled.  He knew he would help his best friend do what needed to be done.  Thompson, still angry, misinterpreted it.</p>

<p>"Dammit, Sam," he continued his indictment, "the whole rotten, murderous system doesn't work without them.  Take them out and the system grinds to a halt.  It's not like they have any friends.  They're loyal to nobody but themselves.  Even the street agents hate them.  And because we're lawyers, maybe we're the only ones who can see the essential thing.  They're the nexus, the critical node, the 'schwerpunkt,' the center of gravity."</p>

<p>"I know what schwerpunkt means, Jon, I taught it to you, remember?"</p>

<p>Thompson paused, but only for a moment, and then, "The sons of bitches took an oath, too, just like us.  They've broken it in every way anyone can possibly break it.  They've got it coming."</p>

<p>The Oath.  It was what bound them to their duty.  It was what bound them as friends. </p>

<p>The Oath.</p>

<p>They had met when they were JAG lawyers in Baghdad.  Both of them owed their law degrees to the United States Army.  Both had been light infantrymen before law school -- Montrose with the Tenth Mountain Division and Thompson with the 82nd Airborne.  Montrose had been toward the end of his tour while Thompson had been the newbie just in.  They had been drawn together by the Mosul case, when some special operations troops had carried out their orders regarding a certain murderous member of AQI, and then been prosecuted for no good reason other than it was viewed by senior JAG staff as politically expedient to do so.  </p>

<p>Appointed as defense counsel, the two had done their duty, successfully defended the men and seriously embarrassed a brigadier general in the process.  Montrose, whose hitch was up and disgusted by West Point "ring-knocker" politics, went home to what was now a budding private practice.  Thompson, who loved the Army and wanted to be a lifer, was crucified on a dozen chickenshit imaginary violations by a half-dozen chickenshit majors and light colonels -- toadies of the BG who sought to curry favor, and promotion, by boot-licking.  It was an old story, but it damn near crushed Big Jon Thompson's spirit and his faith in both the Army and justice.  After Thompson's legal gauntlet was decided by a general discharge, Montrose took him on as a partner.</p>

<p>With the current administration's policies shredding good order and discipline in the military services, they stayed busy defending soldiers on charges of everything from "conduct unbecoming" to desertion to, increasingly, mutiny and treason.  The Pentagon, torn at the highest levels by politics, hated to see them coming, for they had learned to play the press card like pros without ever going over the line and their inside experience -- and old friends who proved excellent sources of E-Ring intel -- made them particularly effective. Unbeknownst to them, Montrose and Thompson had been placed on the growing White House "enemies list."  Even so, they would never be suspected of what they now agreed to do.  They were lawyers, after all.  And no one expects lawyers to moonlight as assassins.  </p>

<p>Yet that was exactly what Big Jon Thompson, like Montrose a family man with a loving wife and young children, now proposed to do.</p>

<p>Something silent passed between them, as the Starbucks crowd surged and eddied, all the while universally ignoring them.  Sam Montrose formalized it with a nod.</p>

<p>He would help.  </p>

<p>Because of the Oath.</p>

<p>Thompson grew reflective then.</p>

<p>"You know," said Thompson, thinking of his daughters, "I don't expect we can get more than a half-dozen or so before they figure out it's us.  We're not operators, you know."</p>

<p>Montrose smiled.  It was, Thompson knew, the man's most dangerous smile.  </p>

<p>"No, were not operators.  But I know an operator.  One of the best in his day.  I think he'll help us."</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">The Unit: Accident-prone Generals</span></p>

<p>Wiley Fortner was at that same time conducting an after-action review in the study of his northern Virginia farmhouse.  </p>

<p>Lord, I'm getting old, Fortner thought, looking at the young eager killers on the other side of his desk, ranged in over-stuffed chairs around the room, but sitting at attention nonetheless.  They had been good bird dogs this night, and they expected a pat on the head.  </p>

<p>Time was, Wiley thought with more than a twinge of sadness, I was sitting where they're sitting.  Only the room was in South Vietnam and Bill Colby was sitting behind the desk and Jack Durer, Stan King and me were sitting across from him, waiting for the approval of the man who sent us.  The chairs hadn't been comfortable and the old French ceiling fans barely moved the humid air.  Lord above, we were all so young.  Where had the years gone?</p>

<p>McAllister finished his recitation.  It had been short, clipped and precise.  The Air Force major general had suffered an accident, slipping in the shower while his wife visited relatives in Connecticut.  Broken neck, the forensics would show.  Poor man.</p>

<p>Poor, unlucky man.  </p>

<p>Wiley Fortner knew about accidents.  He'd arranged accidents like that most of his life, and when he grew too old to arrange them, he taught how it was done to younger, quicker men with a talent for that sort of thing.  It was all on behalf of the national security interests of the United States.  At least, that's what we told ourselves at the time.</p>

<p>Now his squad of five volunteers was assisting tyranny-amenable generals in finding their own inner accidents in order to frustrate administration intentions in the Pentagon.  Thus did Wiley express his disdain for oath breaking corporation generals.</p>

<p>It was, he thought with a grin, more direct, practical and satisfying than writing letters to the editor.</p>

<p>At the grin, McAllister halted, confused.</p>

<p>"Sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>Fortner shook his head.  "Nothing, nothing," he explained, "Just thinking."</p>

<p>The old man looked around the room, taking each man in turn into his penetrating gaze.</p>

<p>"Y'all did good.  Go home, get some rest.  For now, our target list has been exhausted.  We have to wait for some more appointments before we begin to tip the actuarial tables again." </p>

<p>The count stood at two lieutenant generals, a major general, three brigadiers, five colonels and a deputy director of the National Security Agency.  The trouble had been how to arrange the accidents without repeating themselves as to cause.  That had proved impossible.  </p>

<p>The old fly-boy tonight had been the fourth bathroom accident in as many weeks.  It was becoming a nervous joke told in Pentagon restrooms.  </p>

<p>"Did you hear about the general who broke his neck in the john?  They're pretty sure it was an accident because he died BEFORE he was invited to the White House."</p>

<p>CID was more than a little suspicious, but could never find any forensic clues to indicate anything other than personal misadventure.  Exhaustive intelligence gathering, careful planning, and meticulous execution had seen to that. Of course there was nothing that CID did that was news to Wiley Fortner.  He might be long retired, but he still had friends in places both high and low. </p>

<p>A dozen traitors to the Republic were dead at the hands of boys he set in motion, and though Wiley knew it was simple justice, the unit's run of good luck wouldn't last forever.  Sooner or later, something would have to screw up.  It was just in the percentages.  </p>

<p>The young killers of the unit filed out, with McCallister bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>"Good night, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Good morning," Fortner corrected him.  </p>

<p>God he was tired.  He never slept when the boys were out executing an accident plan.  Never.  Colby hadn't been like that.  Colby had always slept like a baby when his assassins were afoot. </p>

<p>Well, no matter.  He had an eleven o'clock appointment in the District with a young lawyer acquaintance of his, but that still gave him time for a nap.  He would need it, he knew.  Montrose had sounded urgent, needy.  What the hell was this about, he wondered.  Another soldier or marine in a legal jam?  Well, as Jack Durer used to say, "If you can't stand not knowing . . ."</p>

<p>The old assassin went in to take a shower and dress for the rendezvous.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Montrose's Toast</span></p>

<p>The lunch was over, dirty plates biding time until the waiter cleared them away.</p>

<p>"Interesting," replied Fortner when he heard the two lawyers present their idea.  "The plan has an elegance to it that intrigues me.  You're only targeting the guilty and you strike them at the very marrow of their cowardly bones.  Kill a couple dozen and the rest will find other lines of employment, bringing the work of their agencies to a standstill."</p>

<p>Thompson interjected enthusiastically, "It will tie the administration up in knots."</p>

<p>Fortner snorted.  "To call these murdering thugs an 'administration' is to assign them a legitimacy that they do not merit," the old man said coldly.</p>

<p>They were in a private dining room of a restaurant down on the rim of the tidal basin, owned by a Cuban émigré who had taken a bullet from a miliciano's Czech-made rifle near Playa Larga in 1961 and lived to survive the experience.  He and Wiley had been friends since the Contra War and here they had no fears of eavesdropping, electronic or otherwise.  Javier saw to that.</p>

<p>"Will you help us, Wiley?" Thompson asked with more of a plaintive voice than he'd intended.</p>

<p>Fortner smiled.  It was a broad, wolfish smile.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied the old man, "and I've got just the boys to do it."</p>

<p>So he told them about the Unit, and the accident-prone generals.  As he spoke, the two young attorneys marveled at the deadly competence of the old assassin and his boys.</p>

<p>"So," Fortner concluded, "have you got a top tier target list?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have," replied Thompson, removing a piece of paper from the inner pocket of his suit.  "Twenty-three names in twelve agencies."</p>

<p>Wiley looked it over.  "Hmmm.  White House Counsel's office.  I like that."  He took another sip of George Dickel.  "Oh, will you lookee here.  I once had a run-in with this asshole about the time Bill Colby turned up dead back in the Clinton days."</p>

<p>He pointed to a name on the list, and presented the paper to show the lawyers who he meant.  "I'll tell you what," he offered, "I'll do him myself."</p>

<p>After a moment savoring the future, Fortner raised his glass.  "Let's toast to our new enterprise."</p>

<p>Samuel Xavier Montrose, who had been silent for a while, suddenly came to life.  "Let me propose a toast that an ancient relative of mine, James Graham, the 1st Marquess of Montrose, first uttered back during the English Civil War."</p>

<p>Wiley Fortner nodded.  He knew the toast.  What competent soldier did not?  But he let the younger man go on without interruption.</p>

<p>They all hoisted glasses and stood.</p>

<p>"He either fears his fate too much,<br>Or his desserts are small,<br>Who dares not put it to the touch,<br>To win or lose it all!"</p>
<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/Montrose2.jpg" style="width: 309px; height: 400px;"><br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">James Graham, the 1st Marquess of Montrose.</span></p>

<p>They all drank, deeply.</p>

<p>When their glasses were empty, Wiley Fortner said, "The next thing is to introduce you to the unit and get you two a couple of SARTs."</p>

<p>"Sarts?" asked Thompson.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Fortner.  "SARTs."<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;"></p>

<p>"Hold On TIGHT!": Surgical Asshole Removal Tools.</span></p>

<p>Three days later, in a comfortable workshop snug against the cold outside, Wiley Fortner held what looked like a piece of pipe with a handle attached to it.</p>

<p>"There are an almost infinite number of ways to kill a man," he told his new students, Thompson and Montrose.  "We really are rather fragile critters.  Modern firearms make the process almost effortless.  The trick is, if you want to kill a man and get away with it, you must either a., shoot him from distance with an accurate rifle, which presupposes you have an unobstructed shot – not an easy thing to arrange -- or b., kill him up close and personal with a suppressed weapon in such a manner that no one knows he's dead until after you're long gone.  In today's surveillance society with so many video cameras around, this too is problematic.  Each method calls for different skills and some men who make excellent long-range killers break down after they've killed their first man up so close that his brains spatter on them and he blows his last stinking breath in their face."</p>

<p>The two lawyers, both of whom had killed men in infantry firefights, nodded.  They knew the difference.</p>

<p>"Now, it is plain from the target list and what we've been able to learn about these people that most of them will have to be rooted out.  They won't oblige us by being easy marks for a sniper's rifle.  So, we are going to have to use short-range weapons like knives and suppressed short-range firearms.  The Unit, who you'll meet tomorrow, is skilled in all manner of mayhem, but we don't have time to train you in the discipline of the knife.  This, on the other hand," and here he hefted the pipe for emphasis, "is just the thing for a couple of tyros like you two."</p>

<p>Presented from a side view, it was apparent that the pipe was a firearm.</p>

<p>"Unless you count the assassin's blade, this is the original SART – Surgical Asshole Removal Tool.  It is a Welrod suppressed pistol, designed for the British Special Operations Executive by Major Hugh Reeves in the dark early days of World War Two.  This one is a later American copy in caliber .45 ACP with a screw on type modern suppressor.  I picked it up in Vietnam and it has been in my private collection ever since.  It is not on any federal list, except maybe one for lost property."</p>

<p>"Now, with modern suppressor designs, the noisiest part of any suppressed firearm is usually the mechanism.  The Welrod does away with that noise by firing from a locked bolt, yet it has the capability for follow up shots using a bolt-action mechanism, here."  Fortner pointed to a large round knob on the back of the pipe.</p>

<p>"It is fed by this .45 Colt 1911 magazine in the grip," he said as he detached it for emphasis.  Here is the manual safety, and here, the grip safety.  You operate the bolt by turning the knob a quarter turn to the left and then pulling it back."  As he spoke, Fortner demonstrated.</p>

<p>"If there is an empty case in the chamber it is ejected.  When you push the knob forward, a cartridge is stripped from the magazine and loaded into the chamber and the striker is put under tension.  When you can't push the bolt any farther forward, turn it a quarter turn to the right and the weapon is now locked, loaded and ready to fire." </p>

<p>"How quiet is it?" asked Montrose.  </p>

<p>Without a word, Fortner pivoted and fired the pistol at some sandbags he had set up in a large wooden box along the far wall.  The only sounds were the click of the striker, the slap of the bullet on the sandbag and a sustained snake-like hiss as the suppressor gave up its gas.</p>

<p>"HOLY SHIT!" exclaimed Thompson.  Montrose was equally stunned, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Fortner echoed ironically, "it is 'holy shit.'"</p>
<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/Welrod.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 275px;"><br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">The Welrod Silenced Pistol -- the original SART.</span></p>

<p>"OK," he nodded to Montrose, "you're the little guy, so you get this.  The reason being that half of the game is concealing your weapon until you get close and this is the smallest totally quiet weapon I've got."  </p>

<p>Montrose looked as proud as a frog eatin' fire, as Fortner's  daddy would have put it.  Thompson, on the other hand, looked disconsolate.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, big boy," Wiley reassured Big Jon, "I've got a better toy for you."</p>

<p>Fortner popped open a briefcase on his desk and withdrew from it what looked to be an Israeli Uzi but wasn't.  "Now that," said Fortner indicating the Welrod on the desktop, "is a piece of history, but THIS is something special."</p>

<p>The old man ran his hand lovingly over the metal and plastic.  </p>

<p>"This is a RAB pump-action suppressed machine pistol in .45 ACP.  The RAB stands for the inventor's initials, Ramsis A. Bear.  Bear is a Georgia good old boy firearms inventor and manufacturer I ran into one day at the Civilian Marksmanship Program store in Anniston, Alabama, back when I still worked as a consultant for the Company.  We got to talkin' about machine pistols and suppressors and I told him that if he could ever come up with totally quiet submachine gun he'd be a rich man."</p>

<p>"Well, it turned out that this northwest Georgia boy could give John Moses Browning a run for his money.  One day, less than two weeks later, mind you, I get a call at home from Bear to come on down to visit him in his shop over near the Alabama line, because he wants to show me something.  That something was this.  He went from idea to finished sample in something like ten days."</p>

<p>"Remember what I told you about the action being the noisiest part of a suppressed firearm?  Well, Bear solved the problem by making a hybrid firearm that is both pump and blowback operated, depending upon need.  He started with a UC-9 receiver and made a top for it from aluminum bar stock he found in a cluttered corner of his shop floor.  Look," Fortner rotated the weapon so they could see it from the top perspective, "See these button head screws?  They hold the whole damn thing together and can be removed with a simple allen wrench.  The stock, which folds along the top, comes  from a PPsh 43 Russian submachine gun.  The rest of it is an UZI spare parts kit in .45 ACP, although you can change the caliber to either 9mm or .22 Long Rifle with a simple drop in.  It uses UZI .45 magazines.  The standard is a 16 round magazine, but I also have a pouchful of 30 rounders that Bear kindly made for me by welding two 16 rounders together.  This front block is a monolithic baffle system suppressor which fits on in place of the standard end cap.  It's almost as quiet as the Welrod, but not quite.  Still, it's an order of magnitude more capable than the Welrod so you can't expect cheese in your grits."</p>

<p>Fortner paused, and grinned, if possible, even wider.</p>

<p>"But that's not the sexy part.  THIS is the sexy part."  As he said it, he racked the UZI forearm back like a pump-action shotgun.  The process was almost noiseless.</p>

<p>"The pump action is buffered to keep it as quiet as possible," Fortner explained.  "No 'clack-clack.'"</p>

<p>"Depending upon the selector setting here," Fortner pointed, "you can fire suppressed from a locked bolt like the Welrod or full auto like any other machine gun.  This is so you can have the ability, in one weapon, to take out your target super quietly, or switch to full auto if things go south and you have to break contact.  With the selector on "slide" you can empty the entire magazine one quiet pump at a time.  But remember, this is a machine pistol spitting forty fives so on full auto, even with the stock extended and planted firmly in your shoulder, that muzzle climb is a bitch.  That's why the safe position on the selector is marked 'S', the slide action position is marked 'SL', and the full auto position is marked 'Hold On Tight!'"</p>

<p>"You're shitting us, right?" asked Thompson.  </p>

<p>"Take a look for yourself," said Fortner, holding the weapon out for the big man's inspection.</p>

<p>Thompson took off his glasses, bent down and squinted at the tiny letters.  Sure enough.  "Hold On TIGHT!</p>

<p>Montrose spoke up, "Not to ask a silly question, but isn't something like this supposed to be registered?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  The receiver was registered before it was transferred to Bear's shop and it was registered again when he shipped it out to an authorized dealer.  Both transfers were perfectly legal.  Bear is many things but not stupid.  He wouldn't hear of an illegal transfer.  Over the years he's carried on a one-man war with the ATF, testifying in court cases as an expert witness, messing up their carefully contrived set-ups against honest citizens.  They hate his guts.  He'd never give them an opening to come at him by doing something illegal."</p>

<p>"So," asked Montrose carefully, "is your name on the paperwork?"</p>

<p>"No," smiled the old man.</p>

<p>"Then . . ."</p>

<p>Fortner's face became long and sad.  "Tragically, it was stolen from the dealer it was transferred to.  These things happen rarely, but they do happen.  Dirty stinkin' thieves.  When they catch him I hope he lives long enough to be strung up by the balls."  Wiley Fortner then ruined his display of faux outrage with an exaggerated wink.</p>

<p>Both lawyers broke up.</p>

<p>"All right," Fortner ordered, now all business.  "For the next half-day we're going to familiarize you newbies with your weapons.  Tomorrow you meet the Unit and we get down to planning our campaign in detail."</p>

<p>Big Jon Thompson picked up the RAB and looked it over for the first time in HIS hands.  He folded out the stock and put it to his shoulder.  "Hold on TIGHT!" he murmured.</p>

<hr/>

<p><i>Saturday, December 26, 2009<br>Folks,<br><br>I've decided to cut the second part in two as well, so there will be a third part tomorrow.  Sort of like the Twelve Days of Christmas, thing. ;-)  Enjoy.<br><br>Mike<br>III</i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">"Recusationers of the permanent, involuntary sort."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Recusal - (law) the disqualification of a judge, attorney or jury by reason of prejudice or conflict of interest; a judge can be recused by objections of either party or judges can disqualify themselves.  – Webster's Dictionary<blockquote></blockquote></span></p>

<p><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">When United States Attorneys, or their offices, become aware of an issue that could require a recusal in a criminal or civil matter or case as a result of a personal interest or professional relationship with parties involved in the matter, they must contact General Counsel's Office (GCO), EOUSA. The requirement of recusal does not arise in every instance, but only where a conflict of interest exists or there is an appearance of a conflict of interest or loss of impartiality.  A United States Attorney who becomes aware of circumstances that might necessitate a recusal of himself/herself or of the entire office, should promptly notify GCO, EOUSA, at (202) 514-4024 to discuss whether a recusal is required.  –  United States Attorney's Manual 3-2.170<span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote></blockquote></span></span></p>

<p>As Montrose and Thompson cross-trained on the Welrod and the RAB, their appreciation of the genius of the designers of both weapons grew apace.</p>

<p>The Welrod, after all, was a seventy year old piece of hardware, but its deadly utility was still obvious.  But it was Ramsis A. Bear who drew most of their admiration.  He had taken the Welrod to a higher plane.  It was difficult to do repeat shots on the same target with the Welrod held in one hand, working the action awkwardly from the rear with the other, the muzzle wavering.  The RAB, on the other hand had no such problem, especially when used with the stock.  The weapon was up, pointed at the target, at all times and as they practiced their ability to do rock-solid single-shots improved.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty had been, as the designer had warned with those three little words engraved on the side of the weapon, holding the RAB on target in burst fire.  Gradually they learned trigger control, using short bursts, and became more proficient, although they wished for a semi-auto position on the selector.</p>

<p>When they asked Wiley Fortner about it, he replied, "Yeah, I know.  I suppose it's my fault.  I didn't ask him for one.  If I had, I'm sure he would have provided it.  He can invent damn near anything within the laws of metallurgy and physics."</p>

<p>The next day, a Saturday, dawned crisp and clear.  Christmas was coming in a few weeks.  Their wives thought they'd gone hunting in West Virginia, but today they would meet the Unit.</p>

<p>They ranged in age from 30 down to 23.  All had been in some special operations unit of one branch or another.  All had come to the attention of Wiley Fortner over the past few years through friends, gossips, or sometimes headlines.  Two were deserters.  One had been spectacularly courtmartialed and given a dishonorable discharge for refusing the current administration's orders regarding Operation Clean Sweep.</p>

<p>He had been represented by the firm of Montrose and Thompson.</p>

<p>"Tommy!" exclaimed Big Jon Thompson when he saw the ex-SEAL.  "I might have known I'd find you here.  How've you been keeping?"</p>

<p>Tom McCallister grinned as they embraced.  </p>

<p>"Busy, Big Jon.  Busy."</p>

<p>Thompson grew subdued.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I heard."</p>

<p>"Been spending a lot of time in general's bathrooms from what I hear," said Montrose, as he shook the hand of the Unit's leader.</p>

<p>The room erupted in general hilarity, some of it obscene.</p>

<p>Fortner intervened.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet my two favorite lawyers, Sam Montrose and Jonathan Thompson.  Don't hold the fact that they're lawyers against them though.  They're the exception that proves the rule."</p>

<p>'You two know Tommy McCallister there.  And I'm sure you've heard of the two most notorious deserters from the U.S. Army.  This is the absconding duo known as Smith and Smith.  One of 'em is named Mark and the other's named Mike, but I can't keep track of 'em so I'll leave you to figure it out."</p>

<p>They were both remarkably alike, probably because they were brothers.  Early in Operation Clean Sweep, the ATF had kicked in the door of their father's home in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  Being as Harlan Smith was an old man in his late sixties who had lived alone since his second wife had died some years before, the ATF had only brought ten raiders to the party.  </p>

<p>It wasn't enough.  </p>

<p>Not only was Harlan Smith an Army veteran and a serious combat shooter in his day, but his son Mark was home on leave from Afghanistan.  When the gun cops shot the barking dogs, it was enough warning.</p>

<p>Oh, they killed old Harlan Smith all right, but only after he put four of them down with his M-1 Garand.  Mark got the rest, and finished each wounded man carefully with a shot to the head, demonstrating the marksmanship skills taught him in turn by his Dad and then by the instructors of the United States government.</p>

<p>He was on the run after that, joined by his brother Mike who deserted after their father's funeral.  Wiley Fortner had found them, with the help of an old friend in Alabama, in the mysterious way of retired spooks.  Fortner gave them shelter, and in time, a way to vent their revenge.</p>

<p>"I'm Mike," said one, extending his hand to Sam Montrose.</p>

<p>"That makes me Mark," said the other, extending his as well in turn.</p>

<p>Unspoken was the fact that Mike had earned the Distinguished Service Cross in Afghanistan and Mark had won the Silver Star in Iraq.  Between them they had three Purple Hearts.</p>

<p>In their ignorance, the ATF had simply picked on the wrong the people.  </p>

<p>"By the way," Mike added, "The way I look at it, I didn't desert the United States government.  It deserted me, and a whole lot of other people, including my Dad."</p>

<p>Montrose, knowing the vast hurt behind those words, could only nod.</p>

<p>"And of these other two rascals, that's Staff Sergeant Fred Dobbin on the right, there.  He's a former Air Force Phoenix Raven team member, graduate of the Army sniper school and damn glad he doesn't have to wear his asinine reflective belt over his asinine blue ABU's anymore when he goes home to Detroit.  He's the only one of this crowd who wasn't forced out of the service.  He just got tired of the bullshit and refused to re-up."</p>

<p>Montrose and Thompson didn't get the reflective belt and "ABU" references but they laughed with the rest of the Unit anyway.</p>

<p>Wiley Fortner continued, "On the left is Major Frank Han, ex-Army intelligence officer, born in Hong Kong, fluent in six languages and can get around in two or three more.  He took an early discharge rather than face a GCM for refusing to obey an order to assist some Brightfire mercenaries on a mission of dubious legality.  Dobbin and Han are our tokens in case the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission comes knocking."</p>

<p>To Montrose and Thompson, they all looked hard as nails.  As hard, in fact, as they had been at that age as young light infantrymen.</p>

<p>Fortner indicated with a cough and a wave of his hand that they should take their seats.  Then he began with the nuts and bolts of the list, which he had written on a blackboard behind him.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, we are no longer in the accident business.  This mission requires spectacular, targeted and gory wet work and the more publicity the better.  Misters Montrose and Thompson have an idea that with two dozen assassinations of prominent attorneys in federal service that we can panic the rest and bring prosecutions by the administration in Operation Clean Sweep and several other oppressive federal programs to a screeching halt.  This plan certainly has the advantage of targeting the guilty.  There isn't a person on this list who hasn't committed treason of one form or another.  Each man or woman is responsible for putting innocents in jail, having them killed in bogus raids or seizing property under false pretenses.  The ATF counsel who signed off on the Phil Gordon raid is on this list, as is the member of the White House Counsels office who pushed both the current prosecution of the Governor and Attorney General of Alabama and the removal of the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the other Chiefs.  In fact, the folks who have been found accidentally dead at our hands these past months all met with him before they signed their own death warrants.  Removing him from the scene puts a cap on that mission.  Questions so far?"</p>

<p>Mike Smith asked, "Sir, I understand the White House counsel and the attorneys involved in the Clean Sweep agencies, but why people from the Bureau of Land Management, the EPA and Fish and Wildlife Service?"</p>

<p>Sam Montrose spoke up, "Sir, I'd like to answer that since I'm responsible for putting them on."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," agreed Wiley Fortner.</p>

<p>Montrose stood up and turned to face Mike Smith.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, Ms. Hartnet of the BLM conducted a blatantly outrageous and unconstitutional prosecution of a rancher named Bill Twombley in western Washington state until she backed him into a financial corner and he lost the ranch that had been in his family's possession for five generations.  The reason?  A dispute over grazing rights that the federal government had previously agreed were his, but that Ms. Hartnet felt were no longer.  And her real reason?  She was friends with a certain Hollywood star who wanted the property for her own possession.  Badgered to distraction and faced with what the feds like to call an 'economic Waco,' Bill Twombley shot himself.  Bottom line, she violated her oath.  She should have recused herself and didn't."</p>

<p>Mike Smith nodded his understanding.</p>

<p>"Thomas Oliphant, the EPA attorney, perpetrated a similar public fraud on a little old widow lady, Mrs. Hannah Parsons,  who lived near a wetlands.  He dispatched a dynamic entry team to 'seize evidence' in the case.  She died of a heart attack after she was thrown to the floor of her living room and handcuffed behind her back."</p>

<p>"I remember that one," said Fred Dobbin, "I'll volunteer to do him."</p>

<p>Montrose nodded and then continued, "Harriet Farqhuar of the Fish and Wildlife Service prosecuted a Wyoming rancher for shooting a wolf that was attacking his cows.  She succeeded in putting Stan Williams in federal prison where he was shanked and killed resisting a gang rape.  When informed of that by William's defense attorney, she merely commented, 'Well, he shouldn't have shot the wolf.'  I know this because the defense attorney told me personally of the case and its outcome.  He was crying when he told me."</p>

<p>Montrose paused, and scanned around the room, looking for doubters.</p>

<p>"But there's one other, larger reason for putting them on the list.  They belong to agencies not directly involved in Operation Clean Sweep.  By killing them we send the message to every attorney in federal service and bring ALL of their prosecutions to a screeching halt when the rest of them bolt.  This is a goodness thing."</p>

<p>They all laughed, being fans of John Ringo's novels.</p>

<p>"By doing this we also reduce the available pool of federal attorneys from non-Clean Sweep agencies to be transferred into the ATF and FBI to fill gaps previously created, both by assassination and resignation.  Jon and I KNOW these people.  We've rubbed elbows with them for years, faced off against them in court, we know what makes them tick.  Gentlemen, we're convinced that killing these 23 criminals with law degrees will cause chaos in the system of legal tyranny that they've helped create.  Considering all the death and chaos they've created, it seems like simple justice to us."</p>

<p>Wiley Fortner interrupted.  </p>

<p>"It's an even two dozen now Sam.  Look at the board.  Mike and Mark Smith have added a US Attorney in Wisconsin.  They did this for what I consider to be valid reasons.  I'm sure you will too."</p>

<p>Fortner didn't ask if there were other questions or concerns about the target list, but merely moved immediately to the tasking and logistical problems.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the biggest problem is that there are two dozen targets spread across the country and only eight of us.  The geography alone is very problematic. I considered bringing more help, but frankly with the addition of Sam and Jon we're pushing the outer envelope of operational security as it is.  Consequently we will be forced to work in two-man teams."</p>

<p>"Now, as most of the targets are in the DC area and we want to make them dead as close together time-wise as possible to prevent them from taking countermeasures when they realize that it is lawyers like themselves who are targeted, I'm assigning three teams to the District, with one team to take care of the seven targets in the West and Midwest."</p>

<p>"This is a big stretch, but because the one in Denver and the two in San Francisco can probably be done on a Friday and Saturday and not discovered missing until Monday morning, that will give the team driving time from San Fran to Seattle.  When the one in Seattle is hit, probably on Sunday afternoon, I doubt the ones in the Midwest will hear about the non-DC actions until Monday, which will give us a chance at them before they're motivated to change habits.  The DC actions will be all over the airwaves, hopefully with a little 'claim of responsibility' that only mentions the District, the others won't feel too pressed to do something until it is too late.</p>

<p>After Seattle, the team will fly by private plane to Chicago, drive to Wisconsin, drive back to Chicago and then on to Saint Louis.  Since Mike has his pilot's license and a stake in the Des Moines action, I am giving him this assignment, which is the trickiest and toughest of all.  Sam," Fortner turned to Montrose, "you will be Mike's backup."</p>

<p>Both Smiths were instantly and visibly upset.  Fortner cut them off.  </p>

<p>"Look, guys, you two together are just too recognizable.  You're both on the run, and Mark is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.  I know you guys are getting good at disguises but the answer is still no, partly because Mark can't fly and Sam can.  Also, Sam can make up perfectly plausible reasons to be in some of those locations due to his law practice.  Am I right, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Besides, Mark, I've got a target here in DC you want to be in on.  I've seen you looking at the board, and you know exactly who I mean."</p>

<p>Mark Smith now looked more conflicted than angry.  Then he grinned.</p>

<p>"You know, sir, for an old fart you don't miss much," Mark replied.</p>

<p>"That's WHY I'm an old fart, Sergeant," Fortner replied tartly.  "Now, do you have any further objection to the assignment?"</p>

<p>Mark shook his head and Fortner turned on his brother.</p>

<p>"Mike?"</p>

<p>Mike Smith looked miserable, but replied, "No, sir."</p>

<p>"I've given you the toughest job because I know you can handle it.  Also, Sam put most of those folks on the target list.  He needs to put his ass on the line if he wants them dead.  Right, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Yessir," replied Montrose, "My money where my mouth is.  But, sir, one thing."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Can we juggle the assignments a bit?  If we start in San Francisco, then go to Seattle and then fly to Denver, then Chicago, I think we can actually get more accomplished sooner."</p>

<p>"All right, get with Mike after this meeting and explain your reasoning, then if he agrees the two of you sell me on it.  If it makes sense, I'll approve the change and adjust the logistics."</p>

<p>Montrose immediately moved over to a chair by Mike Smith and they began to talk in low tones while keeping ears open to the larger meeting.</p>

<p>Fortner continued.  "Mark, I'm going to pair you with Fred.  With the six targets you've got to reach, he'll draw folks' attention looking all mean and black and that might give you less attention, which you can definitely do without."</p>

<p>Fred Dobbin laughed in his big, booming way.  "Yassir, boss, ah gwine to be de ofay bait."</p>

<p>"Cut the shit, Sergeant, I know you got straight A's in high school and then went to the University of Michigan and studied philosophy for a couple of years.  I also know what the Air Force says your IQ is, and that when you're in academia you speak better English and use bigger words than I do.  If I really want to embarrass you I'll tell these gentlemen what mental midgets they are compared to you."</p>

<p>Dobbin snapped in.  "Yes, sir, Cap'in."</p>

<p>"Dobbin, I retired as <span style="font-weight:bold;">Colonel<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span> Fortner."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Colonel, sir."  Dobbin had adopted his poker face, but he was shaking with silent laughter.  So was everyone else in the room. </p>

<p>Wiley Fortner, pissed, but not too pissed, shook his head.  "I give up."</p>

<p>Then he fixed Tom McCallister in his gaze.</p>

<p>"Tom, you'll take Han on the White House counsel job first, then work your way down the other four.  Big Jon and I will take the last six.   It's going to be tough, gentlemen, and I don't expect all of us will make it through.  Some of these guys are not pansies and after a short time, they're going to be guarded tightly, although how competently I can't say."</p>

<p>"Hell, sir," offered Mark Smith, "All the competent ones are on our side."</p>

<p>Fortner snapped back, eyes blazing. </p>

<p>"No, they're not and don't you forget it.  The moment you do, you're dead.  Hell, you may be dead anyway.  We all may be.  Look, I'll do the best I can at gathering further intel on these people before we strike but the fact of the matter is that we'll be doing more with less than we ever have.  The mission requires it.  So I expect we will have losses.  Just do your damnedest to make sure it isn't you and your teammate.  And do your job and recusal ALL their asses."</p>

<p>Montrose laughed out loud and Fortner turned on him, still blazing.</p>

<p>"What's your point?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Montrose shifted in his chair and then decided to tell him the truth.  </p>

<p>"Sir, 'recusal' is when the attorney or judge removes himself willingly from the case because of a conflict of interest.  What we're going to be doing is called 'recusation,' the process of removing someone from a case involuntarily."  </p>

<p>Montrose grinned.  </p>

<p>"I suppose you could say we're 'recusationers of the permanent, involuntary sort.'"</p>

<p>Fortner looked at him sourly, though the other men of the Unit were chuckling.</p>

<p>"Well, okay then, I sure as shit wouldn't want to use the wrong legal term when we're killing lawyers.  So let's go recusation their asses, then.</p>

<p>On that, everyone in the room agreed.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/actgarlandstlouis.jpg" style="width: 337px; height: 400px;"><br> Judy Garland Singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" in Meet Me in Saint Louis.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">"Make no mistake, it's not revenge he's after. It's a reckonin'." – Doc Holliday discussing Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, 1993.<span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote></blockquote></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">"Have yourself a merry little Christmas" -- Vignettes from a Reckoning.</span></p>

<p>Judy Garland was very popular that year.  Someone had re-released a collection of all the best songs from the singer’s heyday, digitally re-mastered and enhanced by some new process.  "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" went to the top of the charts, its songs of love and longing newly popular in a time of economic chaos and impending war, much as they had been in a similar time in the Thirties and Forties.</p>

<p>As the end of the year approached, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," first sung by Judy in 1943 in the middle of the worst war of the Twentieth Century, was playing everywhere – the radio, elevators, and all the new methods of delivering music on demand.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Have yourself a merry little Christmas<br>Let your heart be light . . .<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></p>

<p>In the end, Sam Montrose convinced Wiley Fortner.  They did San Francisco first.</p>

<p>Jessica Hartnet stopped for some French bread on her way home from a long day at the federal building.  Unmarried, frumpy, with few things that interested her beyond her career, she lived alone.  She was humming Judy Garland’s Christmas carol when she disarmed the security system and came in her apartment front door.  Sam Montrose was waiting on the stairs to the right of the door in the dark.  The moment she closed the door, his hand clamped across her mouth and stifled the scream, the Welrod stuck in her right side angled at her heart.  She struggled briefly, but Sam’s iron grip and the Welrod persuaded her to stop.</p>

<p>Mike had told him to simply shoot her in the head without preamble, but Montrose couldn’t do it.  He had to let her know why she was dying, forensics be damned.</p>

<p>Jessica Hartnet was so frightened by this hard apparition that had come from nowhere that her bladder let go.  She didn’t really hear Montrose the first time when he asked her name in confirmation.  He didn’t have to, of course, he had memorized her face.  But he wanted her to know this wasn’t random.  It was a reckoning.</p>

<p>So he said it again.  "Miz Hartnet?"  This time she nodded as well as she could under Sam’s left hand.</p>

<p>"Bill Twombley sent me."</p>

<p>Her eyes grew wide, and something exploded her heart.  The last thing she remembered before the dark was a lizard hissing.  The head shot was superfluous, but required by protocol.  </p>

<p>They didn’t find her body until Tuesday because, frankly, nobody missed her.</p>

<p>About three hours later, Mike Smith shot Thomas Oliphant in the head without a word as he lay sleeping that night.  No explanation was necessary as far as Mike was concerned.  He too was unmarried and had made no weekend plans.  He also was not missed.  </p>

<p>So much for San Francisco.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Next year all our troubles will be<br>out of sight<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></p>

<p>Sam Montrose wanted to tell Harriet Farqhuar of the Fish and Wildlife Service why she was dying too, but it was not to be.  Like clockwork, she ran down near the shore of Whidbey Island every morning by the same predictable path.  So it was on Saturday.  The window of opportunity for the shot was narrow and was decided by the location of a particular cleft in the rocks.  The attorney who cared more for wolves than people never heard or saw a thing, the shot coming from behind as she listened to Judy Garland on her iPod.  Although her boyfriend reported her missing, they didn’t find her body until Wednesday, somewhat crab-eaten, the weather having been cold and foul, which discouraged passers-by. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Have yourself a merry little Christmas<br>Make the yule-tide gay<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></p>

<p>Sam Montrose had been right.  They were able to do Denver Saturday night.  Well, actually, it was early Sunday morning. People are all creatures of habit.  They usually go the same places at the same times for the same reasons.  Thomas Dunphy, for example, was in the habit of closing the bar at the Shamrock and Crown Tavern on Saturday night and weaving his way home to his loft apartment in downtown Denver.  He staggered into the private elevator and, just before the door closed, Sam Montrose stepped in.</p>

<p>"Hey!" slurred Dunphy, "Whathehellyouthinkyerdoing?"  </p>

<p>Montrose smiled. </p>

<p>"Relax, Tom, you just looked like you needed some help."</p>

<p>"Huh?DoIknowyou?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Tom.  I’m Sam Montrose.  We met at the ABA seminar here last year.  You said to drop by if I ever needed anything."</p>

<p>The elevator stopped, the door opened.  Judy Garland was singing on the Muzak.</p>

<p>"Idon’t’memberyouman. . .Youalawyer?Igottagetsomesleepnowcallmetomorrow."</p>

<p>"OK, Tom, let me get you in the door.  You got your key?"</p>

<p>That was one thing, drunk as he was, that Thomas Dunphy did have.  Whenever he went out on a Saturday night, he put his key on an elastic cord around his neck.</p>

<p>"Shuregotitrighthere."  He fumbled at his coat front.</p>

<p>"Here," said Sam, "I’ll get it."</p>

<p>Montrose reached in, retrieved the key and unlocked the door,  ushering Dunphy into his own place.</p>

<p>"Thanksman," said Dunphy, staggering as he always did toward the couch.</p>

<p>"No problem," said Sam, as he produced the Welrod and shot Dunphy in the back of the head.  The fed lawyer collapsed head down (what was left of his head) over the back of the couch, his feet in the air, twitching.  It looked for all the world like he was dancing.</p>

<p>"No problem at all," said Montrose as he turned and left the apartment, locking the door behind him.  The elevator was still playing Judy Garland when he took it to the ground floor.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Next year all our troubles will be<br>miles away<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></p>

<p>Judy Garland was not singing when the U.S. attorney who had approved the raid on Harlan Smith’s house died by Mike Smith’s hand.  As he had feared this day, Duncan Phelps had memorized the faces of the Smith brothers and he was armed with a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 revolver in his pocket.  Neither of these things helped him as he was shot in the face carrying out the garbage.  He had decided not to go into work today after hearing of the killings in DC.  This did not help him either.  His wife, who hadn’t heard a thing, found him shortly afterward, collapsed over a trash bag.  After her crying jag subsided some hours later, she realized that this would relieve her of the stress of the divorce she had planned to file.  Now, she realized, she wouldn’t have to split a dime with the sonofabitch.  After that insight she began sobbing again, but perhaps not so much as before.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Once again as in olden days<br>Happy golden days of yore<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></p>

<p>The days, the lack of sleep, alternating the controls as they drove or flew, the tension of the kills, the expended adrenaline, the highs and lows, it was all taking a toll on them.  That, plus everything so far had gone like clockwork.  It was easy to get slack and despite their best efforts, they did, just when they couldn’t afford it.  It almost got Montrose killed.  Almost.</p>

<p>Patrick Michael Daley wasn’t related to THE Chicago Daley’s but he often let people make that assumption.  It certainly hadn’t hurt his career in federal service.  The principal legal facilitator of Operation Clean Sweep in the Midwest, Daley knew he was on somebody’s list, knew that there had been killings of federal attorneys in Washington DC all weekend, and had just heard of the death of the slightly lamented Duncan Phelps in Wisconsin.  The manpower demands of Clean Sweep caused his demand for a full retinue of bodyguards be pared down to two U.S. Marshals, one of them very green, although Daley did not know that.</p>

<p>When he met them in the lobby, he complained, "Is this all of you?"  </p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Trent Comstock, the older and more experienced of the two.  "We’re all that was available.  But don’t worry, sir, we’ll get you home safe.  The Suburban is right outside.  If you will, sir, let’s get going."</p>

<p>Daley just grunted, but walked out the door with the two marshals.</p>

<p>The trip home was uneventful, just usual Chicago rush hour traffic in the slush and snow.  The younger agent at the wheel, a young black man named Arlen White, had the radio on.  Judy Garland, again.</p>

<p>"Turn that shit off," ordered Daley.  "I’m so sick of that song I could puke."</p>

<p>White quickly punched it off.  Silence reigned in the SUV, apart from the road noise, although White swore he could almost hear Daley’s temper flaring in the quiet.  What an asshole, the young marshal thought.  </p>

<p>It was well after dark by the time they got to the gated mansion.  Daley produced a remote for the wrought-iron, reinforced gate.  A snowplow was working this side of the side of the street, but they were well out of its way on the driveway pad.</p>

<p>The gate did not swing.  </p>

<p>Daley pushed the button again.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Daley pulled out his cell phone to call the house just as the Chicago municipal snowplow slammed into the right back quarter panel of the Suburban and drove it violently into the brick wall that flanked the gate, half crushing the ass end of the vehicle.  The fuel tank ruptured, gas running out in a river, although no one noticed it as Marshal Comstock emerged from the front passenger door, firing an MP-5 at the cab, windshield and passenger side door of the snowplow in short, controlled bursts, although he couldn’t see the driver.</p>

<p>That was because Mike Smith had unbuckled his seat belt instantly after the crash and leaped out the driver’s side door to the street and ran around the back.  In any situation, the advantage goes to the guy who knows what’s about to happen.  As Montrose pulled up in a white van from the other direction,  Mike pulled the shoulder-stocked suppressed MAC-10 into his shoulder and loosed a four round burst that hit the marshal, running up his vest and into his throat and lower jaw.  He was dead before he hit the ground.</p>

<p>Marshal White skidded across the front seat and popped out next to the falling Comstock and took four more center chest.</p>

<p>Daley was shouting incoherently when Mike moved up to the Suburban and emptied the clip into the glass.  No glass, however advertised, is "bullet-proof."  This stuff was bullet resistant, but when twenty-two 230-grain forty-fives hit any glass in roughly the same place in the space of a few seconds, it is going to give.  Thus it was that the window did not save Daley.  </p>

<p>As Mike changed magazines, Montrose moved forward to administer the coup de grace with the Welrod.  He should have made sure of White first. Concentrating on the vehicle, he didn’t even notice as the young marshal recovered from the mule kick in his chest that had almost stopped his heart through the ballistic vest he wore and raised his pistol to kill the advancing lawyer.</p>

<p>Mike spotted the motion by the dim glow of the entrance lights and hosed the marshal’s prone figure as he lay on his back, his pistol in the air.  Arlen White died, there in the snow and slush, protecting a criminal who acted under the color of the law.  He died trying to protect a man who he thought, rightly so, was an asshole.  As he died -- as his arm fell down -- he loosed one last round reflexively as his brain tried to react to its changed condition.  The muzzle flash ignited the gas, and the exploding vapor blew Sam Montrose back and down, skidding in the slush, the concussion taking his senses.</p>

<p>Patrick Michael Daley, shot three times in the chest and shoulder but not quite dead, protected as he had been by the structure of the SUV from the blast, now wished fervently that he was as the flames licked around him and burned him to perdition.  Burned him, indeed, to his reckoning.</p>

<p>Sam Montrose came to somewhere on the other side of Midlothian.  He was lying on the back floor of the panel van, rocking to and fro, his head a ringing universe of pain.</p>

<p>Sam groaned as the van hit a bump going into an old warehouse where some anonymous friend of Wiley Fortner had stashed their next ride.</p>

<p>"Hey!" yelled Mike, as he looked around the partition into the back, "You’re alive!"</p>

<p>Sam just groaned again.</p>

<p>He tried to sit up, failed, and fell back hitting his head.  Oh, my aching ass, Mary, the Blessed mother of Jesus, Son of the Living God, please make this pain stop.  The van came to halt and then, Mike Smith rolled back the side door.</p>

<p>"Hey, buddy, look, you’re concussed, okay?  Don’t try to sit up just yet.  You woke up right after I dragged your ass to the van and bundled you in, about fifteen minutes or so down the road.  I think you’ve just been sleeping off the last few days since then.  You remember waking up before?"</p>

<p>Sam didn’t want to move his head, he just groaned, "No."</p>

<p>"All right, well, look, we’ve got a sedan here for the next leg so you can put the front seat way back and lay down more comfortably than here in this van.  I’ve got some Tylenol Threes here for you.  Don’t move for now, just take the pills with this soda."</p>

<p>Mike dropped the pills into Sam’s mouth and provided a straw.  He drank, swallowed the pills, and then drank deeply again.  It was flat, it was delicious.  He finished it off until the cup made a slurping sound.</p>

<p>"Good," said Mike, "That’s good.  Let those take hold a little and we’ll get you to the car."</p>

<p>Sam slept most of the way to Saint Louis.  He stayed in the motel while Mike went out and did the last job himself.  "Piece of cake," he told Sam afterward.</p>

<p>When Sam felt ready, they made their way home, back to the nation’s capitol where all hell had broken loose, if the talking heads were to be believed.</p>

<p>For once, they weren’t exaggerating.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/hunandynasty.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 240px;"><br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Hunan Dynasty on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C.: Senator Charlie Schumer's favorite restaurant.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></p>

<p>Tom McCallister and Frank Han flipped for the honor of executing the White House deputy counsel.  Frank Han won.</p>

<p>The altering of his facial lines to beat the FBI’s recognition software was old hat by now, and he elected to be his favorite assassination character, an old Chinese man.  When Carleton Harmer met him in the restroom of Senator Charles Schumer’s favorite restaurant, the Hunan Dynasty on Pennsylvania Avenue, he mistook Han for one of the upscale eatery’s managers.  As always that season, Judy Garland was singing out of the speakers in the wall.</p>

<p>As he washed up next to him, the old Chinese man said something unintelligible to Harmer that he couldn’t quite make out.  It didn’t sound Chinese.</p>

<p>"What was that you said?"</p>

<p>The Chinese man turned to him and bowed slightly.  </p>

<p>"It was a Turkish proverb."</p>

<p>"Yes?  What does it mean," Harmer asked as he dried his hands.</p>

<p>"It means, ‘one hour in the execution of justice is worth seventy years of prayer.’"</p>

<p>"Oh, uh, that’s nice," said the White House counsel as he turned to go.</p>

<p>"No, it’s not," said Han, as he stuck a knife into the back of Harmer’s skull, driving upwards through the medulla oblongata and "scrambling his eggs" in a manner Charlie Quintard would have recognized.</p>

<p>McCallister materialized out of a stall and caught the dead man from the front as he fell.  He dragged him into the stall and propped him up on the john, while Han cleaned his knife on a towel, returned it to its sheath, then folded the towel gory side in and tucked it in his pocket.  Catching the latch in a curious piece of bent wire, McCallister closed the stall door and locked it.</p>

<p>They left, one after the other.  The guy with diarrhea in the far stall heard it all and never thought a thing about it.  Turkish, huh?  Boy, the things you hear in a DC washroom.</p>

<p>When he washed up and left, he didn’t notice the dead man behind the stall door.  About an hour later, however, he was telling the Secret Service about the Turkish terrorist who had killed the White House deputy counsel.</p>

<p>They lost Mark Smith on the first job of his team’s assigned list --  the General Counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  It happened because the original plan to take him when he left Main Justice that day with his bodyguards went south when the Fibbies varied the exit and the route.  They knew where they could catch up with him, and they also knew that if they didn’t get him there, they’d never have another easy chance at him, if at all.</p>

<p>Dobbin didn’t like improvisations, didn’t like the idea and knew it would turn into a personal disaster for one or both of them.  "It’ll be like the goddam Wild Bunch in there, and there’s only two of us.  What about the other jobs? "</p>

<p>"Screw ‘em.  They won’t count for anything after this.  Besides, two of the others on the list will be there, too.  It’s a three-fer."</p>

<p>"What about the guy you really want to kill?  Because of your Dad?  What about him?"</p>

<p>Mark Smith hesitated.  "Fortner will make sure of him.  Him above all.  He won’t live out the week, even if I don’t make it."</p>

<p>Dobbin had a choice.  He could walk away right now, or he could back his partner’s play.  The smart thing to do was walk away, dragging Mark Smith with him.  Yet. . . He knew he couldn’t walk away.  The idea made sense, in a crazy, suicidal sort of way.  God knows the publicity would be ferocious.  If they were interested in scaring the hell out of government lawyers, this would do it like nothing else.  Walk away, his brain screamed.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>He would go, although he was sure he would die.</p>

<p>He sighed.  </p>

<p>"We’d better bring all the mags."</p>

<p>Mark Smith grinned.  "Look, we go in, you cover me from the kitchen door while I go from table to table until we’ve got ‘em all.  Then we boogie out the way we came."</p>

<p>"There’ll be guards on the loading dock.  FBI and hotel security," Dobbin warned.</p>

<p>"Don’t worry, they’ll be easy."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right," muttered Dobbin.</p>

<p>"The immediate area is one of the most patrolled areas by DC Metro."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know.  It’ll work."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right."</p>

<p>"It’ll work."</p>

<p>It sounded more like a prayer than anything to Dobbin.  OK, so let it work.</p>

<p>"All, right," he said.  "I’m in."  </p>

<p>Then, after a pause, "We’d better use the cop uniforms."</p>

<p>"Good idea!" Now Mark sounded genuinely enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"C’mon, Raven," said Mark Smith, "Let’s go kill us some big ass gubmint lawyers."</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Office of General Counsel (OGC) provides high quality, timely, and comprehensive advice to the Director, other FBI officials and divisions, and field offices on all aspects of law, particularly in the areas of national security law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, criminal investigative law, forfeiture law, information law and policy, procurement and contracting law, fiscal law and policy, and all areas of litigation to which the FBI is involved.<br>In addition to providing legal advice as requested, OGC reviews the legal sufficiency of sensitive Title III affidavits, ensures that electronic surveillance techniques are used in compliance with the FISA, and supports federal criminal prosecutions. OGC coordinates the defense of the FBI and its employees in civil actions which arise out of the FBI's investigative mission and personnel matters. OGC also provides quality legal training for the FBI, the National Academy, and other law enforcement groups. – FBI Employment Manual.<span style="font-style:italic;"><blockquote></blockquote></span></span></p>

<p>The OGC Christmas party was held at the Capitol Hilton dining room that year.  In keeping with the degraded security situation around the country, security would be tight, the guest list pared down to something manageable in the smallish venue.  This would be just for the OGC brass and those of their significant others who wished to come.  Not many did.  Indeed, the wife of the head of the FISA Unit of OGC persuaded him at the last minute to stay home.  He later would be grateful for her paranoia.</p>

<p>Still, it was downtown DC, in the middle of a capitol security apparatus whose every antennae was quivering, apprehending trouble.  What could happen?  Who would dare try anything at the Capitol Hilton?</p>

<p>A couple of ex-special operations guys pissed off at what had become of their country, that’s who.</p>

<p>The loading dock WAS easy.  The uniforms and bulky winter coats of the DC police helped.  They lulled the sentries and concealed the heavy artillery beneath.  Dobbin was in the lead.</p>

<p>An FBI man held out his hand palm out indicating they should stop.  "There’s a special event going on inside."</p>

<p>"Yeah we know," said Dobbin, "The FBI General Counsel’s Office Christmas party.  We’ve been assigned as back-up."</p>

<p>The FBI man relaxed, but only partly.  "You two got ID?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Dobbin, and he reached into his coat, brought his out.  So did Mark Smith.  The names were phony, but the pictures and the cards were authentic.  Nothing but the best for Wiley Fortner’s boys.</p>

<p>The FBI man peered at them, and again at their faces.</p>

<p>"Uh, OK, but just stand out here if you want.  The inside is secure.  We’ve got it handled."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Dobbin, "Nothin’ but another waste of time in the cold."  Smith blew on his hands, which positioned them near the top of his open overcoat.</p>

<p>The Fibbie looked at him sourly.  "You know, there’s a whole lot of shit going on around this country if you haven’t noticed.  So this is no ‘waste of time.’"</p>

<p>The Fibbie turned to go back inside.  "Yeah it is," said Smith to his back, then pulled one of Wiley Fortner’s gun collection samples from his coat, a Type 67 ChiCom integrally-silenced pistol, and put a 7.65mm slug in the Fibbie’s face as he turned around to argue.  The other Fibbie came next, but he and the hotel dick were already down, courtesy of head shots from Fred Dobbins’ similar Type 63.</p>

<p>No time for hiding the corpses.  This was a straight in blitz.  The kitchen help stood where they were or got out of the way as what looked like two DC cops pushed their way inside.  Dobbin, the bigger of the two, was in the lead.  He kept saying "Excuse, us, folks," as they encountered people just doing their jobs.  There was a protective detail of two at the door leading to the Capitol Hilton dining room.  They were bored, but alert.  Cops?  Their gun hands went inside their coats.</p>

<p>Fred Dobbin held out his hands where they could see them, one of them holding his DC Police ID, a smile on his face.  Both of the protective detail, had their hands on their weapons, but the uniforms, the ID and the smile gave them pause for a half-second, long enough for Fred to suddenly turn to the side, revealing Mark Smith with his Type 67 who shot them both in the forehead before either could clear leather.  They collapsed like sacks.</p>

<p>The waiter following in their wake with the Beef Wellington shouted in horror, dropped his tray with a crash and ran.  Screams erupted behind them as they pushed through the swinging doors to the dining room beyond.</p>

<p>The people at the long tables immediately in front of the door would have had their backs to them, but the crash and the screams had them turning when Dobbin and Smith came into the room with suppressed MAC-10 submachineguns up and ready.  One of the legal luminaries, the head of the Counterintelligence Law Unit, was pulling his own pistol when Mark Smith shot him with a short burst, and then, plans out the window, began firing in the target-rich environment, concentrating on the men.</p>

<p>Dobbin joined him, sweeping to the left, killing the General Counsel, the heads of the Counterterrorism Law Units I &amp; II and the National Security Law Policy and Training Unit.  Bodyguards in the rear tried to engage them, but were knocked aside by the stampede out the main doors and into the lobby beyond.  Judy Garland was singing there, too, but couldn’t be heard over the pandemonium.</p>

<p>By the time the crowd had cleared, the shooters were gone, back the way they came.  </p>

<p>Out the doors, down the dock and around the corner to the car, they had almost made it when a DC Metro unit pulled to a stop in the street and challenged them.  </p>

<p>There was a shootout.</p>

<p>The DC cops lost it, but not before one of them put a slug in Mark Smith’s right thigh.  It nicked the femoral artery.  He was dead before the car got across the Key Bridge, the passenger side floor awash in his blood.</p>

<p>Behind them, counting the guards and the cops, they left fourteen dead.  There were no wounded, which spoke to the Unit’s disciplined accuracy.  Of the seven dead at the head table, only one was a spouse.  The rest were the cream of the federal lawyerly priesthood.  </p>

<p>The head of the FISA Unit, having been saved by his wife’s "paranoia" -- as he thought at the time -- was offered the acting General Counsel’s job.  He not only turned it down, he quit his own and took his family to upper New York state where his wife’s parents had a farm where he lived, nervously, for some years afterward.</p>

<p>Hundreds of other federal lawyers followed his career choice, quitting their jobs as soon as it became clear that the real wages of their government paycheck might be death under the Law of Unintended Consequences.  The federal regulatory enforcement machine ground to a screeching halt.  Tens of thousands of court cases, enforcement actions, civil forfeitures and investigations were stopped in their tracks.  Federal judges quit too, by the dozens, electing to get out of the line of fire until this Fourth Generation civil war was settled, one way or the other.  </p>

<p>The war would go on, of course, without the lawyers.  But increasingly it would be a war without the mask of legal fiction or pretense of legitimacy.  It would be a war of the government against its people.  Force on force.  What the administration did next in Alabama sealed that truth in amber and presented it for the entire world to see.  But that process began with the execution of an idea that two lawyers had, sitting in a Starbucks, when they decided to target their own oath-breaking brethren. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow<br>So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Epilogue: A Reckoning With Mark Smith’s Ghost.</span></p>

<p>With Mark Smith dead and Dobbin’s face on every television screen, it was left to the other two DC teams to split up the target list, although some of them had simply disappeared after what the state-run media were calling "the Capitol Hilton Massacre."</p>

<p>Wiley Fortner and Big Jon Thompson drew Mark Smith’s favorite target.  Smith had been right.  Fortner could not let this one get away. </p>

<p>They had stalked the man for two weeks when they finally arranged a meeting in an elevator.<br>  <br>William T. "Little Willy" McCann no longer believed he was untouchable, but he wouldn’t quit either.  Actually, he was thinking about making an agency change for the better.  With so many vacancies, what couldn’t a man who knew how to keep his head in crisis do for himself?</p>

<p>McCann now knew that Mark Smith was dead.  His body had been found, delivered to a funeral home in Oshkosh.  The FBI seized it "for forensic purposes," and later cremated it, having learned nothing, but preventing Mark’s burial next to his father.<br>But something told him that Mark's ghost would somehow reach out and get him, for it was he, William McCann, who also had a hand in Harlan Smith’s death.  That ghost would probably take the form of his brother Mike, and McCann, nervous as cat, watched for his arrival every minute of every day.  He never went anywhere without a weapon, but somehow he knew that wouldn’t be enough.</p>

<p>But he wouldn’t quit.  There was opportunity within his reach, or so he thought when the elevator door closed on him and two other men in a Georgetown apartment building.  </p>

<p>Judy Garland was singing.</p>

<p>A new secretary, not believing the stories, had invited him up for "an evening at home."  He was about to get vicariously laid again, and so he pushed his fear to the back of his mind and thought with anticipation about the pulchritude that awaited him on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>He only got to three, actually, three and a quarter, when the seedy old man bundled in a tattered overcoat reached out and pushed the stop button.  Strangely, the alarm didn’t ring.  His hand went to his pocket where he kept the small automatic, but the big man to his right grabbed his arm before he could get there and slammed him up against the elevator wall and held him there, face into the paint and filigree, his arm twisted tight behind his back.  The old man, with a strange light in eyes, relieved him of the pistol.</p>

<p>"My," he said, "isn’t that cute?" said Wiley Fortner as he pocketed it.</p>

<p>McCann, thoroughly frightened by the turn of events, realized he was never going to make it to the fourth floor.  But the old man gave him hope.</p>

<p>"OK, McCann, we’re going to let you go now.  Keep your hands where we can see them and turn around slowly."</p>

<p>The big man released him.  For the first time McCann got a good look at him.  Funny, he looked like a lawyer.  The old man, on the other hand, looked like death.</p>

<p>McCann decided to try to bluster.  "Who the hell do you think you are?"</p>

<p>"Me?" the old man said mildly.  "Why I’m your recusationer."</p>

<p>"What?" said McCann, not sure he’d heard right.</p>

<p>"I said, I’m your recusationer, asshole."  Then, speaking to big man, he said, "Recuse his ass."</p>

<p>When the Big Jon finished with the sixteen round magazine of the RAB, pumping one silent round at a time, there wasn’t much left recognizable of William T. "Little Willy" McCann.   The flying brass was caught in a soft cloth brass catcher attached to the ejection port, where it tinkled with each round.</p>

<p>The blood pooled quickly and the men stepped back toward the door to avoid it.</p>

<p>The old man pulled out the stop button and the elevator began to ascend once more.  Pulling out a small paint brush with his gloved hand, he daubed it in McCann’s blood and painted "TOUCHABLE" in big letters on the side of the elevator.  He then daubed again and added the final touch "Sincerely, Harlan and Mark Smith."  He threw the paint brush on the floor.</p>

<p>The elevator door opened.  The secretary would be disappointed, but then, she would have been anyway.</p>

<p>Big Jon Thompson and Wiley Fortner made their way out of the building by the way they came in, the fire escape.  There would be no surveillance pictures of them.</p>

<p>As they departed, Big Jon said to the old assassin, "You’re one twisted bastard, Wiley, you know that?"</p>

<p>Wiley Fortner just shrugged.  "I always did like DePalma films."</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Wolverines</span></p>

<blockquote>"These files are no good without the G-men who compiled them."  -- Michael Collins.</blockquote>

<p>With one exception, when the raid parties of Operation Clean Sweep descended upon the homes of the Wolverines which were scattered across seven counties in lower Michigan, they came up empty.  The unfortunate exception for all concerned was Tommy Brno, who was too sick to "get out of Dodge."</p>

<p>The warning had come late in the afternoon the previous day with a tip from an anonymous source within the Michigan State Police, a mysterious benefactor who worked in the Michigan Intelligence Operations Center in Lansing and had proven absolutely reliable in the past.</p>

<p>Recovering at home from a back surgery the previous week at the VA, Tommy was pretty much bed-ridden and in no condition to hump a rifle and bandoleer let alone a rucksack.  His CO had urged him to check back into the hospital where at least there would be witnesses to his arrest but Tommy wasn't thinking very clearly thanks to the stiff pain medication he was taking.  To be sure, he sent his family away into hiding as they had long planned against this day but Tommy decided to wait until morning when a friend from work would take him back to the VA.</p>

<p>He never made it.</p>

<p>Just before dawn, the Joint Task Force raid party shot Tommy's dogs and broke into the house from front, side and back.  Tommy was ready for them in the back bedroom with his Springfield Armory M1A battle rifle.</p>

<p>Final score for the Feds: They killed three dogs and made a widow out of Sally Brno, leaving her with two darling little girls to raise without a father.</p>

<p>Final score for Wolverine Sergeant Thomas Paul Brno, Marine Corps veteran of two tours of Iraq and one of Afghanistan, and holder of two Purple Hearts: One dead ATF agent and two dead Brightfire employees.  Three wounded, one of them an ATF agent who would be a quadriplegic for the rest of his miserable life, the result of a 7.62 NATO armor piercing slug coming through a two-by-four, glancing slightly off a nail then rocketing through the hallway drywall, glancing again off the top of the SAPI plate in his body armor and entering the front of his neck, severing the cervical spine.  Bullets do funny things sometimes.  This was one of them, not that the ATF agent was laughing.</p>

<p>As he died, Tommy heard the high pitched screaming of the wounded and considered it a good trade.  Not that the Feds and their minions had given him any choice. </p>

<p>Sally Brno wouldn't learn about her husband's death until word made it to the Ontario, Canada, safehouse that she shared with two other Wolverine families.  As her twin girls had just turned three, Sally decided to withhold the news as long as she could.</p>

<p>Operation Clean Sweep was supposed to be about "assault weapons" but it wasn't, not really.  All semi-auto rifles were to be surrendered, yes.  But the administration didn't really care about those in the hands of people who had buried them and had no intention of fighting the Federal raiders.  A buried firearm never killed anybody.</p>

<p>What the Feds WERE interested in were those rifles in the hands of armed citizens who were trained, organized and had every intention of resistance to the Federal tyranny.  Oh, the Feds would get around to the others, the Elmer Fudds, sooner or later, but first they had to put down the mad dogs," as Stanley Silverthorn, the FBI senior executive who actually controlled the operations of the MIOC and the Joint Task Forces in Michigan called them.</p>

<p>At the top of the Feds' list of "mad dogs" in Michigan were the Wolverines.  And now the "mad dogs" had slipped through the Feds' net, leaving not even a single innocent family member who could be arrested to encourage the husband's or father's own surrender.  The raid parties had captured some ammunition stocks that the Wolverine members hadn't had the foresight to cache, but that was nothing.  Silverthorn's bosses had wanted any potential shooters and Silverthorn had failed them.  Thus the MIOC's boss was not pleased and neither was his boss in the District of Criminals, as some Wolverines referred to the nation's capitol.  After being royally chewed out for the failure of the raids, Silverthorn promised his boss, "We'll hunt them down."</p>

<p>He wouldn't have to.  Although Stanley Silverthorn could not know it, the remaining Wolverines were at that moment hunting him.  This eventuality had never occurred to Silverthorn, because at base, he despised "gun nuts," as he thought of them.  He viewed them as boobs, rednecks, and throwbacks to an earlier time that was long past.  He did not respect them as opponents, and this lack of respect would cost him dearly.  The Wolverines were also planning to deal the entire MIOC a blow from which it would never recover. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Collaborator</span></p>

<p>John Piasecki pushed back from his work station, letting his head fall back into the chair's headrest.  How in the hell, he mused silently, did I ever get myself in this position?  I just wanted to be a state cop, not a secret policeman in the American Stazi.  It was after midnight in MIOC and no one else on the shift paid the slightest attention to him.  He looked up at the old coal miner's helment mounted on a plaque which his fellow MIOC employees had given him last year.  "Data Miner, 1st Class" read the legend.  Well, he was a computer geek.  That's why MIOC snapped him up back in 2006.  I was almost five years after September 11, and he had figured when they recruited him to transfer to MIOC that he would be called to identify Al Quaeda sleeper cells.  But Islamo-fascists were really the least of MIOC's concerns.  Heck, they didn't even have an Arabic translator until 2009, and that was only after an article in The Michigan Messenger had embarrassed them by pointing out that faux pas.</p>

<p>The truth was that they spied on everybody, but especially focusing on the "radical right wing militia threat."  From what John could see (and he knew more about the Michigan militia groups than their own mothers did) they weren't much of a clear and present danger to anyone.  Most of them were training -- those that were training -- with an eye to resist gun confiscation if it ever happened.  Leave their guns alone and they'll leave you alone, John figured.  Wasn't that what the Second Amendment was all about?  Until the Battle of Sipsey Street and the passage of the Operation Clean Sweep legislation, any conflict had been unlikely.  Now it was here, and the Feds were using the Michigan State Police, MIOC and every other law enforcement agency that they could bend to their will as cat's paws to enforce it.  The fact that the various Michigan militia formations hadn't blown up a thing, hadn't flown airplanes into buildings, or killed their fellow American citizens did not seem to matter.  Both the state and federal administrations were run by Democrats and they didn't fear the Jihadis.  They feared American firearm owners.</p>

<p>To that end, his superiors were always thumping the tub of "collaboration" between desks, between agencies, up and down the chain.  "We must be seamless," they said, "We must all know what everyone else knows."   (Although, John found that the Feds often didn't share what they knew DOWN the food chain and did not practice what they preached.)  Well, he had "collaborated" all right, but he had a feeling that he was the sort of "collaborator" that the resistance movements of Europe had executed whenever they got their hands on them.  But to his bosses, it was the armed citizenry of their own country they feared, whether they had actually broken the law or not.</p>

<p>"Remember," the college professor who was in charge of the Intelligence Program at Michigan State University, was fond of saying, "The absence of evidence is not the absence of a threat."  "What is more important," the professor would ask at MIOC training sessions, "protecting an American community from a terrorist attack or protecting individual civil rights?"  And he would add, "Sometimes the 'legal way' may not seem like the 'right way."  "The most fundamental principle of ethical behavior is 'Do No Harm'" but, he added, "one of the problems is the definition of 'harm" and "it is often based on one's perspective and personal philosophy of what is important."</p>

<p>You could drive a truck through that gray area, Piasecki thought at the time, and now, in the aftermath of the Battle of Sipsey Street, the Feds were driving long convoys through it daily. It wasn't like the professor was just some university moke.  He had written the book, literally, on police intelligence operations.  A copy of it was on John Piasecki's bookshelf at home.  The professor was the go-to intellectual when it came to operating "fusion Centers" like MIOC and the most prominent advocate of what was called "Intelligence-led Policing."</p>

<p><blockquote>Intelligence-led policing (ILP) is a policing model that has emerged in recent years which is "built around risk assessment and risk management."  Although there is no universally accepted understanding of what intelligence-led policing entails, the leading definition is "a strategic, future-oriented and targeted approach to crime control, focusing upon the identification, analysis and 'management' of persisting or developing 'problems' or 'risks.'"  In simpler terms, "it is a model of policing in which intelligence serves as a guide to operations, rather than the reverse. " . . . Mark Reibling's 1994 book Wedge -The Secret War Between the FBI and CIA spotlighted the conflict between law enforcement and intelligence, and urged cops to become "more like spies."  Intelligence-led policing gained considerable momentum globally following the September 11 terrorist attacks . . .</p>

<p>Intelligence-led policing is still in its early stages and therefore lacks a universal conceptual framework that can be applied to disparate contexts as the new policing paradigm.  Implementation can be difficult, because it requires police managers to "have faith in the intelligence process and in the judgments and recommendations of their intelligence staff."</p>

<p>Some have also questioned whether the foundational ingredient -- intelligence -- has been properly considered, given that: police and security professionals already have to contend with "information overload" from the huge data banks that have been built up in the intelligence process; and increasing raw data is not the same as generating "knowledge" or actionable intelligence.</p>

<p>Finally, intelligence-led policing is part of a larger trend of blurring the distinctions between national security and domestic policing, or the state's military and police functions, and risks the same perils that have tarnished policing in the past, such as political interference, violating civil liberties, and a greater potential for the abuse of police power with the increased secrecy that intelligence work entails.  -- Wikipedia. </span></blockquote></p>

<p>After years on the inside the thing that struck John most forcefully was the degree to which the Feds had co-opted, through fusion centers and Joint Task Forces, the entire gamut of police agencies throughout the country to dance to their tune and pay for the fiddler.  Even now after Michiganders had replaced a liberal Democrat with a liberal GOP governor from Ann Arbor, the Feds still pulled MIOC's strings and the Justice Department was the chief beneficiary of MIOC's work product in its campaign against liberty-minded citizens who insisted mostly just upon being left alone.  </p>

<p>This wasn't true in all states, of course.  In Alabama, the feds assigned to the fusion center in Montgomery were isolated, ignored and often insulted in a hundred tiny ways.  As the competent state and local guys they had worked with before Sipsey Street disappeared from the "official" fusion center into the parallel operation run by Jack Durer and his proteges, they were replaced by counter-intelligence experts who wined, dined and otherwise worked on the Fibbies and tried to flip them into assets loyal to the state and not the federal administration -- and if Durer's boys couldn't get their assistance, they were often successful in obtaining their silent neutrality. As bureaucrats, the Fibbies were experienced at compliant incompetence.  They could not be fired, especially now when their numbers were so reduced by casualties and desertions, for there was no one to replace them.  Much of the working days of these agents was taken up with finding new and inventive ways to explain to their DC bosses how and why they could not do their jobs or answer the increasingly demanding questions headquarters asked of them.  </p>

<p>The only intelligence from Alabama that the Hoover Building believed these days came from a few of their own agents and confidential informants.  They did not know that Jack Durer controlled almost half of those.  So when it came to the fusion center and joint task forces, Alabama more than held its own by systematically recovering and then maintaining its traditional independence as the Founders had intended all along.</p>

<p>But Michigan?</p>

<p>Since before the inception of the Michigan MIOC, the state police had been a lap dog of the federal leviathan.  Now it was even worse, as far as John Piasecki could see.</p>

<p>Between the fusion centers and the joint task forces, the Feds had taken control of almost all law enforcement agencies and now was using them to carry out diktats that bore no relation to the Founders' idea of a constitutional republic of limited powers and distinct roles for each level of government that he had learned at Hillsdale College.  </p>

<p>John's father had come from Poland and by a miracle, Peter Piasecki had made it out of the old country when he was a boy, immediately after World War II.  Settling in Hamtramck, a Polish enclave in Detroit, and getting a job in the auto industry, Peter Piasecki married an American girl and had worked all his life to earn the money to send John to Hillsdale.  Along the way, he proudly told his growing son of their Polish ancestors, relating the stories of Polish resistance to the Tatars, the Swedes, the Teutonic Knights, the Muslims at the gates of Vienna, then the Russians, the Nazis and the Soviets.  "Eleven times our village was wiped out over the centuries," Peter exclaimed, "and twelve times we build it back again.  My father told me that a Pole is a free man born with a brick in one hand and a sword or a gun in the other.  You remember that, Jan.  You are an American, but you always remember where you come from."  John swore to his father that we would, and he had.</p>

<p>Which was why the ghost of Peter Piasecki had haunted John's sleep.  This was wrong.  This was all wrong.  He was an American law enforcement officer sworn to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.  So why did he awake dreaming he was persecuting his father while dressed in the uniform of the Polish Communist secret police?</p>

<p>He hadn't had that dream since he decided to help the Wolverines.  </p>

<p>The Wolverines were special.  John, who had studied all sorts of groups and their dynamics was impressed by he had learned.  The names didn't matter.  Heck, the Wolverines didn't even go by that name, but rather one that John had assigned them.  Michigan after all was the Wolverine State, and wolverines, as they teach every school child, are fiercely independent critters who are afraid of nothing and it is best for everyone to leave them the hell alone.  So, no, they may not call themselves "Wolverines," but wolverines they were.  They didn't even call themselves a "militia" but rather they were a private association of individuals who took their collective duty as armed citizens seriously.  They were certainly "well regulated."  Their leader was ex-military, as were many of the officers and NCOs, but not exclusively so.  They were picky.  They did not advertise, they did not even recruit per se, but rather accepted people who were referred by existing members, and only on trial.  If they didn't make the cut, which was always applied by the stern yardstick of hard training, then they weren't accepted.  Period.  Even so, there were many more volunteers than ever made the grade and that was just how the Wolverines liked it.  As a result, they had a unit of armed citizens that was rougher, tougher and deadlier than any other bunch of folks who called themselves "militia" in the state.  They were supremely law abiding, responsible citizens and had remained so until the Feds had given them no alternative.</p>

<p>Now they were outlaws, on the run, but John knew that if the Constitution no longer protected them, then it no longer protected their persecutors either.  After the death of Tommy Brno, John Piasecki knew that God might pity some of the men and women who called the shots in the MIOC office and on the Joint Task Force, but the Wolverines would not.</p>

<p>Once he determined to help the Wolverines, it hadn't been that difficult to figure out a dead drop that coincided with both his and the Wolverine CO's daily patterns.  It must have surprising, finding that first message, chosen because its contents were easily verifiable.  It must also have been frustrating for the CO that he couldn't know who his secret benefactor was at MIOC.  But after the events of the last week, John figured, the CO had to have grasped that his entire unit, including himself, owed their lives to Piasecki, although they would never learn his name.</p>

<p>There was no time to risk the dead drop method when John had learned of the kick-off of Operation Clean Sweep in Michigan.  He had arranged in previous messages a simple code for various scenarios using the tones of a telephone key pad -- different pulses, number of strokes, and spacing.  He made the call to the CO's cell using a throw-away cell phone.  He made the call, heard the CO answer, gave the pulse message and waited.  There was a sharp intake of breath, and then a fervent, "Oh, shit."  John waited.  The CO said nothing, asked nothing -- not that John would have contributed his voiceprint to the electronic mix to answer it if he had.  </p>

<p>He knew what was going to happen next, for he had given the CO the building schematics and security information for MIOC on a thumb drive only two weeks before.  For if the plans of the Feds were to be frustrated in Michigan, the MIOC -- as an institution and at least some of its people -- would have to die.  John Piasecki had just pointed a very dangerous weapon, the Wolverines, at his own head.  Good thing I never married, John told himself silently.  At least Pop would be proud.  Hell, he's probably singing the Polish National Anthem in Heaven right now.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Wings, a Water Buffalo and Barbequed Database</span></p>

<p>The CO looked around the room at the faces in the rural safe house outside of Jackson.  Some met his gaze, others studied the maps, aerial photos, blueprints and security schedules on the table before them.  The commander of A Detachment grunted and observed for the fifth time, "Tough nut."  The others nodded.  "The street side is so hardened that I don't see how we can even get close.  The target is a five story building overlooked by a fifteen story building.  And the river side has iron fencing around the parking lot in the back, topped by new razor wire.  There are cameras and sensors.  No way we're sneaking through that.  Hell, you'd need a tank to get through the river-side obstacles, and if you've got a tank, you might as well come up Grand Avenue, only we haven't got a tank." </p>

<p>"Gotta be at night," pointed out B Detachment's First Sergeant.  "The place is too packed with cops, Feds and secretaries during the day.  The whole block would end up looking like the final scene of The Wild Bunch, with us dead center."  </p>

<p>Nobody laughed.</p>

<p>"You know, we COULD go find us a homeless suicide bomber," offered Corporal Grimes, the resident comic of A Detachment.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at that one, except the CO, who merely gave a glimmer, a rumor, of a smile.</p>

<p>"No Oklahoma City in Lansing," he said gruffly.  "Detroit is going to be messy enough, even if everything works right."  There was another MIOC in the Motor City that would have to be taken out simultaneously. They all understood how that was going to go down.  "Also, the point of this mission is to demonstrate that we are more than just a couple of bomb-making farts.. . We get to prove that we are American soldiers not terrorists."</p>

<p>"And Marines," Grimes piped up.  Grimes was proud to be a Devil Dog on vacation.</p>

<p>The CO just gave him a withering look, and then took his Randall combat knife out of its sheath and closely inspected the edge with his thumb, very slowly and VERY carefully.</p>

<p>Grimes folded instantly.  "Yessir," he said nervously.</p>

<p>Everyone held their breath until the CO re-sheathed the Randall.</p>

<p>The CO had never gutted anybody that his troops actually knew, but they were all convinced that it had happened sometime, somewhere, to somebody.  They were also convinced of two other things.  They knew that he was capable of it and they also knew that when it finally happened, they most especially did not want it to happen to THEM. </p>

<p>"If the building has to be swept out of people, we'll have to do it from the top down," said the commander of B Detachment, Bravo Six, worriedly.  "That means we have to get to the top and work our way down.  That's gonna take a lot of time.  TOO much time."</p>

<p>The CO smiled.  "Actually," he said, "that's the one part I know how we're going to do it."</p>

<p>"Sir?" said Bravo Six.</p>

<p>"You have several men who are experienced jumpers, right?"</p>

<p>"Yessir!" said Bravo Six, working out instantly what the CO had in mind.</p>

<p>"So, you've got, what, at least six guys who are good enough with a directional 'chute to land on top of that building, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sir, we lost Brno, remember?"  said Bravo Six sadly.</p>

<p>The CO's face softened.  "Yes, Bravo, I remember."</p>

<p>The CO turned to Alpha Six.  "Bill, you're in touch with Pelican aren't you?"  They called the ex-Air Force para-rescue jumper Pelican because he was fond of the gun case he kept his FN FAL in.  "I'm certain he can do the job."</p>

<p>"Yessir," agreed Alpha Six, "he'd love to do it."</p>

<p>"Right.  Well he's seconded to Bravo for the jump.  Make the introductions as soon as possible consistent with security."</p>

<p>"Yessir."</p>

<p>Alpha Six immediately saw some flaws. "Sir, two things.  One, the building is overlooked by the larger state-owned office building, so the approach angles are limited.  I suggest we come in from the river side.  Compared to the 15 story building, it is nice and wide and doesn't have many antennas.  But, sir, anybody in one of the south-side offices will be looking right down on the tops of our chutes. And second,  we won't be able to parachute the device onto the roof."</p>

<p>"No, Alpha, we won't."</p>

<p>A random thought occurred to the CO, something that bounced off what Alpha Six had said earlier.  He fixed his gimlet eye on the A Detachment commander.  </p>

<p>"Alpha, you said we'd need a tank to get through on the river side, right?"</p>

<p>"Yessir, but . . ."</p>

<p>"What if I can get you a tank that SWIMS?"</p>

<p>"Sir?" Alpha Six was perplexed.  "Is that possible?  I mean, for us?"</p>

<p>'Yes," said the CO confidently, "it is.  But we'd have to steal it without getting noticed, put it on a lowboy, truck it halfway across the state and get it into the river upstream without being noticed.  We'll also need to steal some Zodiac boats for the exfil, unless one of you lunatics knows where we can just borrow some."<br> <br>"Hell, sir," said Grimes, "that sounds EASY!"</p>

<p>Dolefully, Bravo's pessimistic First Sergeant, asked, "Which part?"</p>

<p>This time everybody laughed, including the CO. </p>

<p>Bravo Six still sounded worried.  "Sir, we'll still be seen, both on the river and in the air.  Even at night, Lansing's a CITY.  We'll all be lit up like a bunch of visiting Amish on the Las Vegas strip."</p>

<p>"No, Bravo Six, we won't."  The plan now gelled in his head, the operations order half formed.  When he told them what he had in mind, these desperate men, separated from their families, on the run from the mighty power of their own government, began to grin.</p>

<p>Grimes couldn't resist.  "Sir, to quote Kraut Mueller's grandpa, 'Well shit and shove me in it.'"</p>

<p>There was little military decorum in the room for a good two minutes, until the CO brought the hilarity to a close and began issuing orders.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'><img src="images/nightjump.jpg" width='262' height='400'" ></p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">NIGHT JUMP.</span></p>

<p>. . . .</p>

<p>In the end, the phase of the moon called the timing.  That and the weather.  It had to be at night.  The city had to be darkened so they would not be seen by the OPFOR yet without artificial lighting the jumpers would not be able to see the drop zone, a mere postage stamp on the top of a five story building with some antennas and other structures jutting everywhere.  No sane man would do it, but then the Wolverines were never noted for their caution.  They could not get access to the building to place a pathfinder marker of any kind.  So, it had to be done on a cloudless night with just a sliver of moon, enough so that they could see, but not be easily spotted.</p>

<p>A week and a half later, the astronomy lined up with the weatherman.  The moon would be a little less than optimal, but it was doable.  The wind was not still, but the volunteers insisted they could do it.</p>

<p>The plane for the jumpers, borrowed from a private skydiving club, was fueled and ready.  The Detroit operation was on the runway some forty miles away, and Charlie Detachment, a section of the Wolverines that had always trained alone, clandestinely, was needed in both Lansing and Detroit, had split up into small groups of two or three, some with tasks to perform in a certain utility installation, others with more personal and private errands.  The plan was complex.  Anything could go wrong, and the CO was aware that most often something did.  "No plan survives contact with the enemy."  He knew that from a lifetime of personal experience.</p>

<p>Still, with luck it should work,  It had to work.  Looking to the heavens, the CO, said aloud, softly, "Did you hear that, Lord?  Please be with my boys this night."  But the miracle that would make it all work, if it worked at all, sat in two parts under a tarp right in front of him.  One part was the package.  The other was the delivery vehicle.</p>

<p>The CO thanked his lucky stars that one weekend a few years back, he had gone to a World War II re-enactment over on the shore of Lake Michigan.  There, he had seen up close something that was a relic from a  by-gone era.  The members of the Great Lakes Military Vehicle Collectors Association loved to show off their jeeps, trucks and tanks from World War II.  Early in his military service, the CO had seen some of the wheeled vehicles still in use, and the obsolete armored stuff in museums.  But the one thing that drew his attention that balmy spring day near Grand Haven was an LVT-3C "Water Buffalo."</p>

<p style='text-align:center;'><img src="images/LVT3.jpg" alt='LVT3.jpg' width='209' height='144' /></p>

<p></a><span style="font-weight:bold;">LVT-3C "Water Buffalo"</span></p>

<p>Designed by Donald Roebling, and built initially at the Food Machinery Corporation factory in Dunedin, Florida, the LVTs were amphibious vehicles used by the U.S. Navy, Marines and Army in the Pacific for getting troops to beaches, supplying them once they were ashore, and even in Europe for river crossings.  Although early models were just mechanized, open tubs, the LVTs were later modified with top machine gun mounts and  artillery turrets.  The engines were moved to the side sponsons, to allow greater cargo space in the center and ramps were fitted so troops could exit quickly without having to heave themselves over the side.   The version sitting before him was an LVT 3 that had been built by Borg Warner and later modified by the Marine Corps in 1949, fitted with both an armored roof and an extended bow for better buoyancy, not that any of the "purists" at the re-enactment would have noticed.  But the CO noticed, asked some questions, talked the owner into taking it back out on the water, paid attention to how the controls operated -- he was fascinated.  Afterward, he got a business card from the owner, a rich guy who had made his money in auto parts (well, actually it was his father who had made the money in auto parts and the son was still comfortably living on it).  The fellow had invited the CO to come see his collection at his farm on the way home after loading the LVT on a old U.S. military low-boy and entrusting his employee-driver to get it home. </p>

<p>When they arrived at the farm estate, there, packed into a large, modern, climate-controlled steel building stood row on row of Shermans of different types, Stuart, Chaffe and Walker light tanks, M8 and M20 armored cars, even an M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, along with jeeps and trucks of various kinds.  The CO, quite frankly, was like a kid in a candy shop.  But where was the Water Buffalo? he asked.  They had stopped for lunch and the trailer should have gotten here ahead of them. </p>

<p>"Oh, I keep that down at the lake I own south of here, and I take it out every Fourth of July for friends.  I've got a DUKW there, too.  Its a blast to go boating at the controls of a Water Buffalo."</p>

<p>Looking at the LVT now, in front of him, on the old factory landing upstream five miles from the target, the CO recalled the short jaunt on Lake Michigan and reflected that he was about to find out how much of a blast it really was.  He hoped the owner would forgive him for what he was about to do with his prized possession, but he doubted it.  There are no obsolete weapons, Kraut Mueller was fond of saying, only obsolete tactics.  Here was an "obsolete" weapon system, built in 1944 for a world war whose veterans were busily dying off.  And once more it was going to war, this time against the same government that had it built in the first place.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">H-Hour 0215 </span></p>

<p>A minute and half after leaving the plane, Bravo Detachment's jumpers -- three ex-military and three experienced sport skydivers -- saw the lights on the building's roof and everything else below them instantly swallowed in darkness.  Contrary to what most people think, it is rather difficult to deliberately cause a major power outage, with all the sensors, alarms and redundancies the power companies usually build in.  Fortunately, there was a private in C Detachment who had worked for Pacific Gas and Electric out in California for several years before moving back to Michigan after a divorce to stay with his dying mother.  All he needed was some infrastructure information, a few tools, an unconscious security guard and, voila, most of Lansing was darker than the inside of a hairy dog.  As their eyes adjusted, the Bravo jumpers could make out the faint sheen of the river, and used that to adjust their course to the roof.  Then the emergency generators came on in the building and the DZ was visible once again. Pelican, a sport jumper who had more hours in the silk than the rest put together came down first, legs running, and silently collapsed his chute.  It was perfect, until Carl, the leader of this short squad, landed right on top of him and broke Pelican's left collarbone.  One by one three more Wolverines landed without killing themselves or anybody else, although the usable space on the roof was almost gone.  Rigoletti, came in last, circling, looping trying to get in between the antenna structures and snagged on a tower, whipping him around and depositing him hanging feet down, but over the lip of the roof, suspended with nothing between him and the entrance of the building many stories below but his harness.</p>

<p>"Oh, shit," Rigoletti prayed.  He could see the new guard shack on the street below, the concrete traffic barriers.  In the soft glow of the emergency lighting he could see the two Brightfire security guards standing outside the small building, listening to the ululating wail of vehicle emergency sirens, looking up and down Grand Avenue, but fortunately not looking UP.  Pelican, cradling his left arm,  looked over the side, making a slight noise.  Rigoletti extended his closed fist -- FREEZE.  Then, seeing that he had Pelican's attention, he pointed below with an extended right hand to the guards.  About that time, Carl looked over beside Pelican, whispering, "What the fu . . ."  Pelican threw his good hand over Carl's mouth.  In a very low voice next to the team leader's ear, he said "Quiet."</p>

<p>Whispering, especially using words with "s" sounds, is almost always louder and more easily heard than talking in low tones.  Carl knew this, he'd just forgotten.</p>

<p>Pelican looked back at Rigoletti, down the guards and then back at Carl's face.  Softly he said, "Wait here."  Pelican walked over to the other team members, shucking out of their chutes, rearranging their gear and quieted them as well with hand signals.  Moving over to one of the access doors, he found what he was looking for: a brick that some smoker had brought up here to prop the door open when he came out on the roof to smoke.  Picking it up, he walked across the roof to the right rear corner of the building.  Sizing up the pavement below, he chucked the brick with his good hand as far as he could, aiming for the concrete walkway around the building.  Before it hit, Pelican was on his way back to Rigoletti, collecting the other team members on the way.</p>

<p>The brick hit hard with a loud crack, and Rigoletti watched as both guards jumped, doped out the direction of the sound, and started to move around the building to where the missile had landed.  Now, trained personnel, having no immediate backup, would not both venture out of sight of their duty post.  But it was dark, they were both new to the job and their training hadn't been all that it could have been.  No traffic moved on Grand, the city was dark, the noise was loud and both men were scared at what might be around the corner toward the river.  There was, of course, an entrance security detail within the building and another roving pair who moved between floors, checking locks and so on.  Startled, the guards instinctively huddled for support, and realizing that SOMEONE had to check it out, they covered each other as they moved away from the front of the building. .</p>

<p>When they disappeared around the corner, Carl and the other three team members pulled Rigoletti up and back from the ledge.  Other than having about five years scared off of his life, he was unharmed, although why he hadn't crapped his pants was a mystery.  Still, the result was better than the contingency plan in case the roof was untenable.  Then the six men would have descended to the parking lot, killed the alerted guards outside and fought their way in the front as a diversion while the river team came in the back.  Nobody was dead.  So far so good.  Rigoletti, a locksmith in real life, started to work on the door leading below into the building.</p>

<p>On the river, the LVT -- filled with fourteen men of Alpha Detachment and the CO in the driver's seat -- drifted downstream with the current, its engines off.  Astern of them about three hundred yards, four Zodiac boats, daisy chained to a fifth whose outboard muffled by a "Quiet Box" was muttering lowly, were tagging along, going just slightly faster than the current. </p>

<p>Alpha Six perched on top of the Water Buffalo, like the CO looking through an AN/PVS-14 night vision monocular, watching the banks.  They were at the mercy of the current in the center of the channel now, not wanting to start the deafening radial engines until they had to crawl up the bank and over the fences and wall obstacles.  The building was in sight, two hundred meters downriver.</p>

<p>The two guards, moving slowly out of caution, rounded the rear corner on the river side, missing the brick which had bounced off into the shrubbery.  Puzzled, finding nothing in the beams of their Kel-lights, they continued their sweep across the back of the building intending to complete a full circuit back at the guard shack.  From the LVT, Alpha Six looked up toward the roof of the building.  There, hanging over the edge on a string, was an infrared cyalume stick, indicating that the jumpers were down successfully, ready to begin their sweep from the top.  Invisible to the naked eye, it showed up like a small spotlight in the night vision monocular.</p>

<p>Alpha Six hand signaled below, and the message was passed to the CO: Airborne element in successfully.  No radios would be used unless the mission went south.</p>

<p>One hundred meters to go and the LVT, caught in some undercurrent, began to twist about, the bow beginning to point at the opposite bank from the one they needed. </p>

<p>The Bravo airborne element was through the roof door and descending the stairs to the top floor.  </p>

<p>The CO started the LVT with a roar, revved the engines and slewed around, headed now toward the bank near the bridge pilings which provided the best angle of attack up and out of the river.</p>

<p>The security guards, almost back out to the shack in front, heard the roar and clanking behind them as the Water Buffalo hit the riverbank side walk and picked up speed as it closed with the steel security fence.  The noise also attracted the the interior first floor guards, three in number, who ran to the back glass doors to see what was happening.  Two of the men thought it might be an auto wreck on the bridge.  The other thought it was a boat disaster on the river.  It was a disaster all right, and it headed straight at them.  When the LVT hit the fence, it begand to climb it until the forward inertia and weight snapped the fence anchors, which were meant to stop anything up to a modern automobile but not a 17 ton amphibious tractor.  The exterior guards came around the corner again, took one look at armored death coming, they thought, straight at them and turned and ran like the furies of Hell were on their tails.  The LVT ignored them, pivoted slightly to the right and made for the glass doors.  After the steel fence, the glass door frame was nothing, and the LVT drove straight into the building, the interior guards fleeing out the front door and and endeavoring mightily to catch their companions as they raced north down Grand Avenue.  </p>

<p>Bravo element finished clearing the fifth floor and, two flex-cuffed janitors in tow, descended to four.</p>

<p>The roving guard team, also on four, were racing to the elevator (against their own quick reaction training, for they had been warning to take the stairs in an emergency) had their backs to Bravo, when Rigoletti and Carl emerged from the stairs and called on them to drop their weapons of die.  It was just a job to them, so they naturally just dropped their weapons.  Flex-cuffed, they joined the janitors.  </p>

<p>There was nobody on three.</p>

<p>The ramp dropped on the LVT in the lobby and Alpha Six emerged, leading nine men, two of whom pealed off and raced for the stairwell at the other end of the building and four of whom were burdened by pushing and pulling a bulky box on a rolling pallet jack.  Four others emerged to take up security positions on the first floor.  </p>

<p>If you wish to create an electro-magnetic pulse large enough to endarken a country, it needs to be generated by a megaton-range nuclear bomb high in the atmosphere.  If you wish to create one big enough to wipe out a delicate electronic infrastructure in a single building, it can be non-nuclear and much smaller, but you have to get it right next to the computers, drives and data you wish to expunge.  Kraut Mueller had quietly circulated plans for a unit a little bigger than a residential outdoor heat pump which could be charged for a few days prior to use.  You could haul it around in a small pickup truck.  You could put it on a pallet jack.  This was what the Wolverines called "the device."  </p>

<p>The operational guts of MIOC were in the basement.  The device in the box was supposed to be delivered as close as possible to operations center's computer equipment.  The pallet jack was dragged to the stairs, the box slid off the jack, through the door and helped by gravity, slid down the stairs to the landing, then slid down again until it was just outside the basement entrance to MIOC.  The four man assault team, led by Alpha Six had preceded them with C-4 charges ready to blow the basement door.  It was not necessary, for at that moment a MIOC employee who had paid attention to the emergency action drills opened the door from the inside to go upstairs to find out what the hell was going on.  In a smooth motion, Alpha Six flung him to the side, wedged his own combat boot between the door and the jamb and whipped a tear gas grenade into the room through the crack.  Small arms ricocheted off the door harmlessly.  Five more CS grenades were flung in the door by Alphas who now had their M40 gas masks on.  When Alpha Six, donning his own mask,  looked back at the employee he had flung aside, he was curled up and retching on the floor, his face against the tile, splashed in his own vomit.  The device handlers shoved and kicked him roughly farther back into the stair landing so they could position it to enter the MIOC door.  He gave no resistance.</p>

<p>Three more janitors were corralled on two and forced down the stairs toward the ground floor. </p>

<p>MIOC employees fleeing the CS were bolting up the far stairwell when the two men assigned to it, fired a burst into the wall that ricocheted wildly and then called on the choking MIOCs to drop their sidearms and come on up, one at a time with their hands on their heads.  They came up and were hustled out of the building, told to run and keep on running.  The same thing happened to the captives from the upper floors.</p>

<p>Lansing police cars began to arrive out front, beginning to work that old familiar "establish a perimeter" magic.  </p>

<p>From both ends, the Alphas began to clear the basement offices of the MIOC.  They captured three unarmed holdouts and killed two armed men who elected not to surrender.  Both were FBI agents.  The unarmed were hustled up and out.  The device, once again on the pallet jack which had been manhandled clattering down the stairs, was trundled to the center of the computer area.  The Wolverine bomb technician checked it one last time.  The EMP generator's capacitors were full.  Yelling "Fire in the hole!" through his mask's voicemitter, the electronic sapper set the time delay and cleared up to the first floor, following the rest of the team.</p>

<p>The teams, Alpha and Bravo, gathered at a rear exit, ready for their run down to the riverbank and the waiting Zodiac boats.</p>

<p>In the LVT, the CO drove through the front doors so that the Water Buffalo was just sticking out of the building. rear ramp still down inside the lobby and clambered up into the weapons turret on top. He had one final surprise for the Lansing cops outside.</p>

<p>You see, the thing that the LVT's original owner was most proud of was the armament he had chosen to put in the restored armored amphib.  The laws of the United States were onerous where automatic weapons were concerned and that meant the original .50 caliber Browning heavy machine gun which had once graced the turret after its 1949 rebuild.  To buy one was quite expensive -- not that he couldn't afford it, mind you, but really, he just wasn't into firearms as much as he was into armor -- and besides who needed the ATF crawling up your butt with a microscope?</p>

<p>So he had replaced the mount where the Ma Deuce had been with a flame thrower.  Oddly enough, there are no restrictive laws against flame throwers, whether man-portable or vehicle mounted.  They are not firearms and there are no licenses or permits required to own or use one.  When the inheritor of the auto parts fortune celebrated his Fourth of July, he did so at night with gas-propelled jets of burning napalm on his own private lake.  Now the CO jumped up into the flame gunner's seat and sprayed a burning arc outward toward the cars outside.  He caught three with the burning juice, two of which ended up incinerated, the drivers running for their lives.</p>

<p>A crescendo of impotent small arms fire hit the front of LVT.  The CO did not care, for he had run out the back ramp and joined his men in their mad dash down the river bank and the waiting boats.  </p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img src="images/Zodiac.jpg" alt='Zodiac.jpg' width='400' height='286' /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Zodiac Boat.</span></p>

<p>The CO had chosen Zodiacs instead of more easily obtainable pleasure boats was that most modern boats were too electronically sophisticated with electronic ignitions and fuel pumps to risk being put out of action by the EMP device. Jumping into dead boats that they would have to paddle with their battle rifles would been embarrassing to say the least.  The Zodiacs were fitted with pull-rope outboards, each tooped with a "Quiet Box" so they could make way without a lot of noise.</p>

<p>Also, regardless of the noise, he didn't want just one boat for all these men, but several, so they could split up if necessary.  They needed to be fast if necessary and they needed to be able to carry a load of armed men and equipment.  But more than that, they needed to be hard to spot at night -- dark in color and low in the later -- and quiet at slow speeds.  Zodiacs were the only type of boat that fit the bill.  They also had the advantage that each had an assigned boat handler familiar with the type from prior military service or just skunking around on Michigan's lakes.</p>

<p>Three of the Zodiacs packed with Wolverines were already past the bridge in their flight and one more had just shoved off into the river current when the CO did a forward leap into the last one as it was leaving at bank.  He landed on the luckless Grimes, who began cussing a blue streak until he saw his assailant.  </p>

<p>"Uh, s-sorry, sir," stammered the unit smartass.</p>

<p>The CO, his lungs heaving and his gut churning, still gasping for breath from his sprint, just grinned.  </p>

<p style='text-align: center;'><img  src="images/empmagnetron.jpg" alt='empmagnetron' width='272' height='185' /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">One type of EMP magnetron.</span></p>

<p>Behind them, the EMP device went off without a boom, just a click, a crackle and a silent pulse, destroying every computer, hard drive, thumb drive and CD in the entire building.  In a reverse of Michael Collin's war against Dublin Castle, the G-men were worthless without the files they had compiled. </p>

<p>Mesmerized, even blinded, by the flamethrower, their perimeter never fully established, the Lansing cops did not see the Wolverines go.  The boats were never found.  There was an overgrown drainage ditch two and a half miles downriver.  The boats had been nosed into the bank.  The outboards unshipped and the boats, still fully inflated, stacked sideways inside a large panel van.  The boats would be used again.  "Damn right," said Grimes, "why go to the trouble of having to steal 'em all over again if we need 'em?  Hey, now we got a NAVY!"</p>

<p>The teams had escaped, dressed in civilian clothes, in the eight pre-positioned vehicles, all going in different directions.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after the the Wolverines broke contact, and ten minutes after a bomb threat had cleared the Detroit MIOC office, a light plane carrying four hundred pounds of quarrying explosives was flown into it by a terminal cancer patient with a pilot's license.  His name was Matthew Brno, Tommy's uncle.  Matt Brno and the meticulously crafted databases of the Detroit MIAC office ceased to exist in their previous forms at the same instant.  </p>

<p>The phone woke Stanley Silverthorn just before three in the morning.  Silverthorn gradually realized,as the bad news kept coming through the earpiece of the phone handset, that he had made a fundamental error in judgment about who was the hunter and who was the hunted.  Even so, he did not think that through all the way to its logical, personal conclusion.</p>

<p>Cursing, he threw on his clothes and headed for the black Suburban in the detached garage of his home on Lake Lansing.  Still bleary eyed and groggy, he flipped on the lights as he moved through the house.</p>

<p>Three hundred and thirty-two meters down the shore on a small spit of grassy land sticking out into the lake, "Hot Gates," Charlie Detachment's best shot, muttered to his spotter Midnight Mike, "OK, I owe you a beer."  </p>

<p>Mike smiled but ignored him, concentrating on the target through the spotting scope.  As he had predicted, Silverthorn heralded his own coming with luminescence.</p>

<p>Bedroom, hallway, living room, dining room, kitchen, all lit up, one after the other.  "Here he comes," said Mike.</p>

<p>The breezeway was mostly floor to ceiling glass and had been added as an afterthought by one the house's previous owners.  The banker's wife, a Southern Belle raised in south Mississippi, had not liked going out to the car in the middle of a Michigan winter unprotected, so she browbeat the bank president and, when that failed, withheld favors until he signed the paperwork to have the breezeway constructed.  Thereby proving that: (a.) her nether regions could be just as wintry as the outside if she felt like it, and (b.) men will still do anything to keep the women in their lives happy.</p>

<p>The breezeway was almost thirty-five yards long and had a twenty-five degree angle in the middle of it.  After the bend and thence extending until the entrance to the garage, the glass was almost entirely perpendicular to the line made by the axis Hot Gates' M21 suppressed rifle.  That was good for the Wolverines hiding in the grass.  Physical deflection of a shot through the window would be minimal.</p>

<p>When Silverthorn flipped the switch as he opened outer door of the kitchen, the breezeway lit up at both ends like a stage and the quarry entered the kill zone.  The bright light confused the sight picture only momentarily as pupils adjusted and thirty-five yards under observation through primo rifle optics is a long way to walk in front of a competent sniper's hide, whatever the intervening distance.  </p>

<p>Before the sun rose that morning, Charlie Detachment assassinated three FBI and ATF supervisors in addition to Silverthorn as well as two college professors who had made a tidy living teaching tyranny how to be more efficient.  Like Silverthorn, they were killed at their homes spread across lower Michigan, completing the payback of MIOC for the death of Tommy Brno.  Stanley Silverthorn would not get around to "hunting down" the "mad dogs" of the Wolverines.  Not that he cared one way or the other about that anymore, as one new hole in his head let the dawn in and another new hole on the other side let an astonishing amount of blood and brains out.  The confirmation coup shots to his crumpled body were hardly necessary and almost gratuitous, but required by the SOP.</p>

<p>Hot Gates bought Mike a six pack of his favorite label on the way back to their safe house.  </p>

<p>At 0817 Hours, the power came back on in Lansing.</p>

<p>But the Michigan Intelligence Operations Center, and its vital assistance to Operation Clean Sweep, was over, finished, wiped out with a minimum of human casualties.</p>

<p>In the CS-free atmosphere at the 15 story building next door, the survivors of the Wolverine raid were debriefed by a host of federal and state investigators.  John Piasecki was one of them.  With a split scalp, broken finger and red, swollen eyes from the CS, no one would have suspected that the man who had been flung aside by Apha Six and kicked into the corner by his EMP bombers had been the unseen mastermind behind the Wolverine counter-stroke.  Nor would they have guessed that in the confusion, as the A Detachment withdrew, he had given Alpha Six a new throwaway cell phone and a one time code pad.</p>

<p>In fact, in the leadership gap created by the raid, John Piasecki was promoted and tasked with the rebuilding of the MIOC.</p>

<p>Once again, a son of Poland would face the future with a brick in one hand and a sword in the other -- not, however, in the way his superiors intended when they selected him for the job.</p>

<blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">
<p>NOTE:  Absolved is a work of "faction," that is, a fictional work about fictional people and events written across a backdrop of facts and reality.  The depiction of Michigan's MIOC and the state's slavish toadying to the federal leviathan is, as near as I can determine, entirely accurate.  There are professors in the Michigan higher education system who have made big bucks teaching the finer points to what have become -- with the Bush "War on Terror" followed by the Obamanoids' use of those structures in a "War on the Right" -- political secret policemen working in an increasingly Orwellian Department of Pre-Crime backed up by Ingsoc thugs of the "joint task forces." The quotes I put in the mouth of the fictional professor, for example, were actually said by a real professor and, if you can figure out who he is, you may find them on variuous web sites.</p>

<p>In other words, although the background canvas of this story is accurate, the characters are fictional and names have been changed to protect the guilty -- guily parties who accept the tax money of the people of Michigan in order to spy upon them, not for what crimes they have committed, or even for what crimes they may reasonably be planning but rather for what "thought crimes" they may be harboring against an increasingly tyrannical federal leviathan.</p>

<p>As for the Wolverines, you may speculate all you wish if there actually is a group of armed citizens as depicted in the chapter who are truly that liberty loving, that well trained and that righteously deadly within both the Founders' definition of "well regulated militia" and living within the borders of the state of Michigan.  If there is, they do not call themselves <span style="font-weight:bold;">the</span> Wolverines.  In that case, names have been not been changed to protect the guilty, nor the innocent, but rather to provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_deception">"maskirovka"</a> to the competent.  If so, that makes Wolverines, and the entirety of my novel Absolved, a cautionary tale for those who aspire to be agents of an American Stazi. Put another way, if you ain't one of those, Mr. LEO, you have nothing to worry about. But if those who are think that one of their own would not offer them up to an assassin's bullet out of deeper held principle because he is a fellow LEO and thus wouldn't "turn traitor," I would suggest they read the real history of one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamon_Broy">Eamon "Ned" Broy.</a></p>

<p>In the movie Michael Collins, Ned Broy is portrayed as having been killed by the Brits.  He wasn't.  He survived the War for Irish Independence and the Irish Civil War that followed.  In fact, although captured and threatened with execution, he outlived for a considerable number of years dozens of his fellow Royal Irish Constabulary G-men and British secret service agents whose names he gave to Michael Collins for disposal by the "Twelve Apostles" of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squad_%28Irish_Republican_Army_unit%29">"The Squad."</a>  </p>

<p>By all accounts, Broy even slept well at night, knowing it had all been done in the cause of Irish freedom.  A cautionary tale indeed for any would-be American secret political policemen.-- Mike Vanderboegh.</p>
